description: "Clifford M. Ott donated this broad collection of historical photographs in 1992. Ott was an avid amateur photographer who amassed over 10,000 slides, prints, and negatives spanning the years from 1883 to 1990. The digital collection represents a selection from Ott's whole collection, which he compiled into eleven albums containing a total of over 1,800 images of Moscow and surrounding Latah County and used to educate local citizens."
