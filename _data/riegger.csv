Aerial View Of Parkwater Roundhouse,"A photograph of the Parkwater Roundhouse as see from the window of an airplane. An excerpt from Ron Nixon: 'Remember my remark about Joe Lux suing us. So maybe some of these remarks may be unacceptable. Anyway I knew Joe pretty well as I was the go-between with him and NP during negotiations to retrieve 684. So after the deal was closed I asked him to be sure to let me know when the engine was to be moved Nez Perce to Craigmont so as to get pictures. Time went by and I heard nothing from him. He lived in Spokane so it would have been a simple city phone call. I called him a couple of times and he said 'not yet' or words to that effect. Then late one night when I was working with the CP operater at Lewiston he mentioned that CP men were going to Nez Perce to get the 684 moving. So I called Joe and he said, 'Oh yes. They plan on moving it at eight in the morning.' !!!! I had no automobile at the time but had access to NP company cars. NP said I could use one but would have to get it back the same night, which of course was impossible. I checked with the bus companies and there was no bus I could get to Lewiston before the next morning. So as a last resort I called the airport and found that there was a plan for Lewiston at six in the morning. After some hectic getting-ready, I was on the plane and took this picture of the Parkwater roundhouse as we went over it. A little dull as I shot it through the window and it was real early in the morning. Got to Lewiston in time to catch the CP going to Craigmont. Then I had to bum a ride to Nez Perce on the Nez Perce truck. They were already working on 684 when I got there. You already have my first pictures.'","Nixon, Ron",,,1905-05-04,yes,freight trains; railroads (infrastructure); ,,46.242196,-116.472788,,,"MG 183 Hal Riegger Papers, 1981-1986",MG183_F25_014,"No Copyright.
