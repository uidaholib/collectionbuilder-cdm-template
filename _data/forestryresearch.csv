Essential parts of the seed house are the dryÂ­ing  room, heated by a hot air furnace, a sha~er, run by an  electric motor. a fanning mill, and trucks, each with eight  trays.  Cones are collected in fall, dried in the drying room  over winter, and the seed is extracted in the spring. Cones  are let into the trays by gravity, and run into the drying ~om  room. 'Yhi te pine was dried eight hours, red pine four hours,  jack pine six hours. and cedar two ho~rs. After drying the  cones are threshed out in the shaker. Cedar was threshed out  by hand.

The soil in the nursery is light sand.  Rotation.  Seed beds occupy the land two years, or possibly  three or four. Then a crop of soy beans is grown, but is  plowed under while the seeds are still green. A dressing of  stable manure is then applied. soy beans add nitrogen to  the soil. A crop of buckwheat is then grown'Â· but is also  plovred under before it becomes ripe . Buckwheat is grown  because it adds so much humus to the soil.

MARKING POLICY STATEMENT  GENERAL BAS IS OF llAN AGEMENT  National Forest timber is a crmp. The fundamental purpose of  management is to harvest this crop at the point where it yields the  largest or most prmfitable return.  Generally speaking, trees should be marked for cutting as nearly  as possible at the time when the mean annual growth begins to fall of:L  This does not coincide with diameter growth, for even where t he growt  rings get narrower the tree may still be putting on more increment  than when the the tree was smaller and the rings wider. Also in gener~  a larger proportion of desirable and valuable products are secured frc  the larger trees. Therefore, ""'hen increment ceases to increase s atisÂ­factorily,  the tree has reached commercial maturity and ordinarily  should be harvested. ""Maturity"" throughout this statement is used witb  this meaning.  This shows the importance of studying carefully the individual  tree before deciding that 1 t is no l .)nce r profitable to keep. The  amount of growth necessary to add steadily to the board foot volume is  of course, most important in estimating the value of the tree, and is  shown to be only 1/10 as much for a 32-inch tree as for a 10-inch tree  The other scale shows that in cubic feet(e.g. for pulpwood) trees are  putting on relatively less in the larger sizes, or in other words,  their actual volume does not increase so rapidly with size as their  board foot volume.  The foregoing discussion applies primarily to sawlog production,  as the maximum amount of lumber is, of course, secured from the large~  trees which can practicably be grown .  Large portions of the ~ashakie Forest, however, are necessarily  managed for the production of hewed ties. On these areas, therefore,  commercial maturity occurs at the point when the tree produces the  most hewed ties. Commercial maturity ahould not be confused with  physical maturity in the usual sense. Trees amy often produce the  maximum number of ties before thay are actually or physically wature.  The Washakie Forest is logically divided inti two distinct manage  ment areas. This division is brought about by location, topography,  character of tree growth, and markets of the areas concerned.  The most important of these areas is in the Upper Wind River  country where the timber is of a good grade and size, and in this regi  the tie indus try calls for a management form primarily for hewed ties.  This market necessitates that this area be handled with this aim in  vie'l'' . But due to the mature and overmature stands of virgin timber  which contain trees of sizes too large for hewed ties, the utilazation  of the larger trees for s a.\â€¢â€¢ logs and s avred ties is at present necessary  The other area is within the Lander district. In the past, the  more accessible stand of timber in this region has been heavily burned  over, and at present except for a fe,., small isolated tracts, the  timber is below a merchantable size . and no large amount of cutting  will be possible within the next 20 years. The territory surrounding  this latter region is largely a farming and stockraising comnunity,  with Lander as the center. and since the demand for forest products wil  be principally for lumber, the system of management should be planned  with thie in mind.  The same general principles governine marking hold good, however,  for both hewed tie and sawlog $ta.nds. Each tree must be examin~d closeÂ­ly  and the markers conclmsions based on external appearance, chec~ed  sufficiently by use of the increment borer to insure proper selection.  Marking involves more than the mere selection of trees for cutting. It  is the first essential step towards regulating the cut and oaking  management plans effective. From the ultimate standpoint of forest  management, a partial cutting system is desirable in all types where  the condition of the stand makes this feasible. Partial cutting with ~  short cutting cycles as economic and stand condi tiona justify, is thereÂ·  fore the basic policy which should be kept in mind in deciding upon  the treatment to be given each area, and in actually conducting the  marking.  In stands cut under the selection syete~ and managed for the prodÂ­uction  of he,ved ties, the aim wi '1 be to make a second cut as soon as  the largest trees in the stand attain a maximum diameter of lSi inches.  This will ordinarily occur from 30 to 50 years after cutting. S awlog  areas will ordinarily be managed on a longer rotation than areas manaBÂ­ed  for the production of hewed ties so that the products of large size  may be secured. In overmature stands where clear cutting has been  necessary, the period of second cutting is uncertain, and will not  ordinarily occur within 100 years.  Conditions on the ground after cutting and brusa disposal are  completed are what count. This principle should be kept in mind in  determining the marking policy for a given sale, and sacrifice if  necessary made in stumpage rather than in desirable silvicultural work  MARKING PRACTICE  Marking in all types ~ill follow the selection system. Only in  clearly defined cases â€¢â€¢1here different treatment is justified because of  fire or wind damage, insect injury, injury from other causes, disease  or decadence, or stagnation beyond point of recovery will this practice  be departed from. The object in all markin~ is to harvest the comnerÂ­cially  mature and overmature timber and also to remove defective,  diseased or overcrowded trees in the younger age classes.  Desighating areas for cutting.  ~ven where a heavy cut is ~'arranted on account of maturity or  seriously defective condition of the stand, an absolutely clear cutting  is seldom warranted. Trees of unmerchantable size are usually found on  the area as well as immature merchantable trees which sh~uld be reser-  ved from cutting. This means that we should go slow in designating  areas for cutting without rr.arlJing. There are also many disadvantages  from the standpoint of sale administration in allowing cutting to tak'  place without ma~king. Accordingly, authorizing cutting without marAQ  ing should be done â€¢ri tb great caution and the practice held to areas  whore as satisfactory results will be secured from this plan, with thâ€¢  necessary increased supervision as ,.,ould be secured through narking.  There is no intention in this statement to discourage the designation  of area for clear cutting in those places where it is manifestly the  most economical and practical procedure. The idea is that the Forest  Officer should be absolutely sure of his ground before adopting this  practice.  Areas where clear cutting is to take place will be clearly and  specifically defined. Order of cuttlng in all such operations, exceptÂ­ing  possibly very small sales, will be controlled by dividing the arel  into small units, and designating the sequence of cutting.  Diameter Guides.  Diameter guides are intended merely to give Forest Officers  inexperienced in markinf in a given type of timer, a gemeral idea of  the average sizes at Â·Â· hich the different species reach commercial  maturity. These guides are not intended as diameter limits to be appll  ed automatically and care will be necessary to see that marking office  understand their application . The size at which maturity is reached  will vary widely with conditions of site and growth and marking must  be based upon a close examination of each tree. However, in stands  being managed on a hewed tie basis any tree should be removed which  would be too large for heâ€¢ .. ing at the time of the next cutting.  Vary !:arking.  One of the chief faults in marking practice is failure to change  the marking '""hen the character of the stand changes . In passing from  a thrifty mature stand to a pole or overmature stand the marking must  change abruptly . On ridges and otherwise poor sites, trees virtually  stop growing at smaller diameters than on good sites, and the marking  must vary accordingly.  Defects of various characters often furnish sufficient reason for  taking out trees ,,.hich are approachinP.' maturity or certain trees loÂ­cated  in stands where there is an opportunity to practice selection.  Ho,rever, the same defects occuring on younger trees may not be of s uff!  icient importance to warrant removal of the tree before the next cut,  The marker will also be less exacting regarding ~efects in considering  thees along the edges of openings or parks or in any other location  where a tree is badly needed for aeed or for otherwise assissting in  extending the forest.  For~ed and Leaning Trees.  Trees will not be marked for cutting merely because of a fork or  sli~ht lean. However they should ordinarily be marked, even though  immature, if they have forks so located that an appreciably ereater  quantity of the more valuable products will never be produced. ForKs  of certain types split off or allo""' the entranse of disease. Knowledge  of local timber will indicate the need for marking trees with forks  of a character subject to such damage.  Unless a tree leans to the extent that it will pos s ibly fall  before a second cut, or lose in value through distortion, or unless  likely to rub or distort another tree, it will not be marked oerely  because of the lean.  Basal Fire Scars.  Basal fire scars are most important in lodgepole pine. ~he damage  done on individual tree depends upon the size and character of the scar  Only rarely in lodgepole pine do the scars become pitched over; but  when such ts the case the scar has little or no effect on the need. for  marking the tree.  Trees showing scars '''ill be marked only when the scar is really  a serious defect that is retarding ~rowth or threatening the life of  the tree . However, basal fire scars on lodgepole pine and Englemann  spruce are ordinarily of sufficient importance to warrant marking the  trees affected.  Basal fire scars on all species should be examined critically,  because if any not exists the tree should invariably be mar~ed.  Can.cer.  Canker infections are important in lodgepole pine for breakage  takes place and fungous diseases gain entrance at the point of lnfec~  ion. Trees with the larger, more serious infections, should be marked  but trees with small cankers, unimportant from the above standpoits,  should be marked only ~hen they can be removed as a thinning measure.  Mistletoe Infected Trees.  Mistletoe is found chiefly on lodgepole pine. Heavily infected  trees are characterized by a general appearance of unthriftines s , poor  thin crowns, sickly, pale colored, and often short needles, distorted  branches, frequently dead or dy~ng, and the presebce of witches broom.  As far as possible all infected trees should be marked for cutÂ­ting.  Some stands are so heavily infected that it is impossible to get  rid of all mistletoe vÂ·ithout clear cutting. In most lodgepole atands  this treatment is proper.  Insect Infestations .  The subject of insect infestations is too lu.re;e : o at ',empt t o  cover in detail . Inf""estC:~.ti u ns of any consequence should be promptly  reported with a view to undertaking special control measures without  delay in all cases where condi tiona warrant.  f  On the other habd. there is an opportunity to reduce insect damage  of a minor nature and eliminate the infestati~n before it becomes serÂ­ious  through intelligently directinf the regular marking practice. Bark  be '3tles cause the moe t serious damage and it is important that trees  containing them be marked for cutting and utilized before the broods  ei'!lerge.  Dead Shoots.  Frequently in lodgepole pine and occasionally in other Â· species, a  dead stub of a limb extends from the bole at an upward acute angle.  Water works into the bole at the junction of such limbs with the trunk  and almost invariably causes rot to enter. which fully justifies the  marking of trees where this condition is present. Dead lower limbs whict  are the result of natural shading out and which protrude from the trun4  at a right or downward obtuse angle are not serious defects and do not  constitute a juatification for marking the tree.  LODGEPO~E PINE TYPE.  Railroad ties mine timbers . mine props, fence posts and telephone  p 'Jles are the products ,..hich VJill be secured fro~ this type. Sawtimber  will occur nearly always as a by-product from the few larger trees  scattered through the stands. However ,. some stands show a very proÂ­nounced  slowing doâ€¢nn in gro,vth at comparatively small sizes , reaching  their point of commercial maturity at mine prop size.  Excepting on the Lander District area, where sawlog production  will be the rule, this type will be managed primarily for the productioJ  of hewed railroad ties, with lumber, mine props, and similar materials  produced as byproducts. There will be but little difference in marking  practice whether stands are managed for sawlogs or hewed railroad ties,  except that on areas beinp managed for hewed ties, it is important that  all trees which will be too large for hewing at the time of the next  cutting be removed at the first operation .  Thrifty lodgepole pine forests with an average representation of  age classes should, in theory, be cut over at regular intervals, taking  out the trees which have attained physical maturity.  However, railroad ties are the most important marketable product  which can be secured from such stands, and they are obtained from the  larger trees. In general, therefore, in thrifty as well as in older  stands of sawlog or tie size, trees are cut when they produce the maxiÂ­mum  or nearly the maximum number of ties. Obviously there is nothing  gained by holding trees beyon~ the point where most ties are produced  and where the additional increment is in the form of slabs or lumber  which are generally unsalable on this forest. Consequently all trees  e.re considered mature '''hich have reached the polnt where ~hey will  produce the maximum number of ties, and this policy makes it practicablt  to mark more or less mechanically on the basis of diameter guides.  Sone trees even in better than average stands cease rapid growth  before attaining tie size. Cutting them at this point would certainly  be harvesting the largest ammunt of wood for the time involved in growÂ­ing  it. If the market will absorb the product this treatment is proper,  but small sixe trees produce only mine props and fence posts and the  ma~ketin this region can use only limited amounts of such material.  Consequently, the only alternative usuall y is to let such trees stand,  even though groming very slo,Â·ly, until they finally r each s awlog or  railroad tie size.  Overmature 8 tands.  In these stands the majority of the trees have passed the point  of maturity and are overripe, evidensed by sparse, short crowns or spi~  tops, smooth gray and thin bark, and a general appearance of being in  poor growing condition.  All mature, overmature and de~ective trees of a merchantable size  will be removed. This means practically a clear cut of trees of merchÂ­antable  size, leaving the Â·thrifty, immature trees which are windfirm.  On account of the increased growth that may be expected as well as to  insure reproduction in case the advanced reproduction should be subÂ­sequently  des tro~ed by fire, it is vrell to leave such trees if they may  reasonably be expected to withstand the wind.  Thrifty Mature Tie or Sawtimber Stands.  In this class of stand the majori.ty of the trees have not passed  beyond the mature stage. most of the trees being in fairly thrifty  condition and having full crowns and reddish rough bark.  The object in marking will be to remove trees which have reached  or passed matytri ty. and defective and crowded trees belO'"" this size. In  marking for thinning purposes where immature trees are involved, the  principles outlined under ''Thinnings"" will apply.  Most of these stands are managed for heâ€¢Ned ties. Trees capable of  yielding the maximum number of ties are considered mature and should be  marked, even though the tree might still be gaining in board foot volÂ­ume.  A minimum diameter of 13"" d.b.h. will work out satisfactorily on  most sites, but should be varied where conditions warrant. A lower  guide may be justified toward the upper limits of the type in those  stands which reach actual maturity at smaller diameters.  Care should be taken not to leave trees which will be too large  for he~ing at the next cut.  Trees below the minimun diameter limit of 13"" will not be mar~ed  unless they are stagnated or contain spike tops, fire scars, dying or  very thin crowns. lightning or frost cracks, insect infestation, canker  porcupine injury or other defects serious enough to moke the trees less  valuable before th ~ next cut. Minor defects, however, should not be  overemphasized in marking. Judgement must be used.  Lodgepole pine is often subject to windthrow when the stand is  removed i r. t""'Â·o or more cuts. This should be considered in marking, and  sufficient trees must be left to insure leaving a windfirm stand. This  may require the leaving of some trees which are commercially mature,  but in sufficiently thrifty condition to last over until the next cut.  Care should be taken ho,..Â·ever, not to leave tall trees which will pro-  )  ject much above the general cro'''n level of the rest of the stand.  Pole Stands.  The object of management herP is to remove occasional mature trees  and as far as markets '""ill permit to make such thinnings as are desirÂ­able  from a s ilvicul tural standpoint. See paragraph under â€¢'Thinnings ...  Stagnated stands of poles too small to produce railroad ties should in  theory be cut clean. About all that can be done at present is to hold  these stands until the market for pulpwood. mine props, posts or other  small sized products develops sufficiently to make cutting possible.  ENGL~ANN SPRUCE TYPE.  On the upper \'lind River portion of the Forest the Englema.E.n s pr1.1c  type will be managed for the production of hewed railroad ties. The  basis for this is that there is an established market for only this  class of product and the type occurs largely ir-. mixture with the preÂ­dominant  lodgepole pine type which is being managed for the production  of hewed railroad ties.  On areas managed for hewed tie~, Englemann spruce will be marked  in the same manner as lodp,epole pine. That is, trees large enough to  produce a maximum of he""'ed ties will be marlced and no trees will be lefÂ·  unless needed for seed or wind protection. which are apt to be too big  for he~&ng at the next cut.  On the Lander district, mhere saÂ· log production is the rule, sprue~  wi 11 be marked on the basis of maturity removing trees only where the  board foot increment has ceased to increase at a satisfactory rate.  Immature trees will be marked only because of defect or where thinning  is desirable.  In either tie or sa""log stands a sufficiently dense stand of young  and middle- aged trees will usually remain after cutting to protect  its elf against wind throw. If trees much taller than the ne\"" canopy are  left they will afford little or no additional protection to the remainÂ­ing  stand and are the ones most likely to blow down. Accordingly care  should be t.alren not to leave tall trees, the crowns of i'â€¢hich will  extend much above the general cro~n level of the stand after cuttlng.  Approximately 60% of the merchantable volume of the stand will be  removed by follo,Â·ing this pol ~ cy.  LIMB~R PINE, DOUGLAS FIR, AND SUBALPINE TYPES.  The basis of manaeement outlined for ~nglemann spruce will be  applied to these types.  PSPEN TYPE.  Markets for aspen are limited and this species generally contains  a great deal of def ect. Excelsior, fuelwood and other minor products  will be produced. Except when marking may be desirable bee a use of some  special local conditions - such as along highways or in the vi~inity  of recreational areas - trees will be designated for cutting ;ri thout  marking .  MIXED TYPES .  Mixed types will be ma rked in the manner prescribed for the major  species involved . The same principles apply where small patches of a  dif f erent s pecies occur upon areas where railroa~ ties are being proÂ­duced  but where sawmills are not planned d5n at the time of the next  cut. Thisis illustrated by Englemann spruce oc curing in patches on  north slopes or in s trips along streams within a lodgepole pine stand  that is ad apte1 to the production of hewed ties .  I N FBR I O~ SPECIES.  ..  ..I,  The cutting of alpine fi r ""'ill be uniformly required where productfi  of this species a~e marketabl e . Since alpine fir railroad ties are not  accepted by the rai lroad the util i~ a Â· i on of this species can be reqÂ­uired  only vrhere it can be marketed for lumber.  Where marketable, the species will ordinarily be marked heavily,  taking out all trees 'hich are 10"" d..b.h . and larger. ..  GE~ERAL MARKING CONSIDERATIONS  Thinnings;  Stands of immature timber which are too dense to permit of proper  development occur in nearly all types. These stands may occur as pole  stands covering considerable areas or as small patches or cl um ~)S within  areas of older timber. In either case it is good silviculture to thin  these stands by removing sufficient trees to provide room for the reÂ­mainder  of the young stand to develop. The extent to which thinnings  can Â·be practiced depends almost entirely upon the class of products  which the marke1:.s can absorb . At present we are unable to conduct operÂ­ations  in many stands of small s'ized timber where thinnings are silviÂ­culturally  desirable. As time goes on this condition will likely right  itself but fo r the tirr.e being thinnings will have to be largely conÂ­fined  to pole size stands large enough to produce mine props, poles, -y..Â·  posts, or other small produsts. -. ~  '  All thinning ope r ations must be handl ed with care. In general the !  thinnings vrill be made from below. That is, the poorer and usually .  crowded orpartially suppressed trees will be taken to make room for tbe  better individuals . Where, through natural survival of the fittest, a  feÂ·,., trees in the group have obtained dominance ar:td the others are more I  or less badl y crowded so their res ponse to release is questionable, it  is obviously poor practice to mark the larger trees to make room for  the poorer ones. These larger trees are reaching the point where they  are making the most valuabl e and rapi d growth and to cut these to free ~  doubtful trees will detract from the final yield obtainable.  { )  )  In making thinnings, the aim should be to obtain ample and approxÂ­imately  equal spacing in the stan 1 lef t on the ground. This is of  particular importance in lodgepole pine where immature pole stands are  often fairly even aged and where there is less choice between the trees  to be taken and thos e to be left.  Reproduction Openings.  In the Englemann spruce and lodgepole pine types, mature t r ees  frequently occur in groups. Where these groups are cut, a small opening  is left surrounded by middle-aged and young trees. Such openings afford  reproduction an excellent opportunity, and marking officers should not  be reluctant about making them when they result from carrying out the  marking policy outlined heretofore.  Timber Cutting on Scenic Areas.  Around the ~ore important areas used, or likely to be used, exÂ­tensively  for recreation the policy will be to make an improvement  cutting removing dead , insect infested and diseased trees, and only  such other trees in need of removal as can be spared without marring b  the beauty of the setting.  Along highways the standard marking policy should not be varied  if sufficient timber '""ill remain to insure a forested appearance on t:te  area. It is very desirable for the publie to see forestry in practice.  However, in case the character of the stand is such that under the regÂ­ular  marking policy only scattered seed trees will be left for any  great distance along a road, tree of a character ordinarily marked for  cutting will be reserved to the extent necessary to avoid leaving  areas which have a denuded appearance. -~~~  On camp and summer home si tes shade is an important feature and  unless marking according to the standard practice will result id adeÂ­quateqshade  on such areas. sufficient trees will be left for this  purpose. Such additional trees as far as possible shauld be those which  will last over until the next cutting.  ADMINISTRATION.  'Marking Percentage IM Contracts.  Forest Officers preparing timber sale contracts should not be  influenced by the natural desire of operators to secure the greatest  voltime possible. The percentage stated in eac~ contract should be  ""  base on conditions on the ground, and application of the marking pracÂ­tice  to the particular area.  Diseased Trees .  Removal of ""diseased~ trees of all species. as defined in timber  sale contracts, will be uniformly required as called for by the insÂ­tructions  on page 11 of the Forest Manageffient Handboo~.  _,  ' I  Sample Marking.  Instructions relative to sample mar~ing are contained on page 31  of the Forest ~!.anagÂ·ement Han:ibook.  Leaving S awlog Trees.  Stands will not be cut over for hewed railroad ties, or other  products, leaving sa~Â·log trees except with the specific approval of  the District Forester .  Checkinp Up Marking.  Regulan inspection of . the marking just in advance of the cutting  presents an excellent opportunity to catch up trees overlooked in mar~Â­ing  and every advantage should be taken of this.  Both intensive and extensive records of cutover areas indicate  that we have not give sufficient attention th the preservation of the  young trees below marking size, which will form the growing stock for  the next crop. In the conversion of old foreats where young trees are  scarce , these fe""' are our most important asset, and administration  which will prevent their needless destru.ctlon in felling and skidding  operations ~ill be required.  General.  It is the duty of those in charge to see that the variou.s office~s  understand the principles and interpret and apply the instructions  uniformly. One standard should hold for the entire Foree t. Men neÂ·dy  assigned to markinf should not be allowed to mark independently until  sufficient timber has been marked by them to insure their getting a  thorough knowledge of the ,-rork before they are turned loose.  The above plan ""rill govern all marking. Addi tiona or modif'icatioa  will be approved by the District Forester before being made wffective.

Those immense  stretches of cut-over lands, mostly too rough  or too sterile for tilling , have not awakened  us to their vast potential worth as growers of  wood. ~ully one-fourth of our land area ought  to be kept in forest - not poor , dwindling  thickets of scrub, but forests of trees fit  for bridges and houses and ~hips . Handled  by the best timber-cropping methods , our  present forest lands could be made to grow  even more timter each year t han we now use.  But much of our cut-over land, lying idle or  half productive, is now an immeasurable lose.  It pays little or no taxes, it keeps few  hands busy, it turns few wheels, it builds no  roads. Idle forest land has scrapped schools,  factories, railroad s , and townsJ it has dotted  the land with abandoned farms; it has created  a migratory population.

(Chemical Eradication)  GROWTH AND YIELD STUDBS 01 1J:TISTZR...~ WHITE P E~  IK RELATION 1C BLIS'i:~ RUST CONTROL  by  R. H. Weidma~, Director,  Northern Rocky Mountain Forest Experiment Station  Perhaps the ~ost important need for further yield study, from the  standpoint of blister rust control , dep~s VTith the ratio of western white  pine to other species in the much mixed stands of this forest type . The  point which makes the matter especially urgent to know about is that the  proportion of species chan,;es as the stand develops from youth to maturity.  The need is to knoÂ», for example, if a stand which contains 15 per cent  white pine at 20 years of ase will have a greater or less percentage of  that species at 80,90, or 100 years. I t is necessary to have the answer  to this question in order to l:now w~ether eradication of Ribes will be  financially profitable in young stands containing lo\7 proportions of  white pine.  The common condit ion in the Â·.vestern white pine type is a mixture of  a half- dozen or more species , including nhite pine , l arch, Douglas fir ,  white fir , Engelmann spruc&lt;:J, hemlock, and. cedar. In these stands white  pine has a high stumpage value ~d the otl1er species have little or no  value at present. If the ulti~te cost of er~dication--and several eradiÂ­cations  may be necessary in the~ife of the youn6 s t and--will be greater  than the stumpage value at matu~lty of the white pine to be saved, then  it would be a mistake to eradicate. Factors which influence the problem  in addition to the changing ratio of species are site quality and density  of the stands . Naturally the yield to be eA.'Pected at aey given age varies  according to whether the sit e is good, fair , or FOor. Yield also varies  through a wide range from fully stocked to very open stands.  In order to show the relationship of all this to Ribes eradication,  the cost of eradication in several hypothet ical stands is here carried  forward f r om youth to maturity. The figures given are based on existing  -11-  normal yield tables for three qualities of site, ~ssuming fully stoCked  stands except as indicated. Four conditions of composition are assumed:  20, 40, 60, and 80 per cent white pine with the remainner of mixed species  which have not been differentiated. The standard formula for calculating  profits in forestrJ was used with such modification as was necessary. The  rotation used was 100 years and a single eradication was assumed to be  done at 20 years of age. An interest rate of 3 per cent was cho sen to  correspond with that used in ~~ge appraisal calculations of the u. s.  Forest Service in Idaho and Montana. Two sets of stumpage prices were  used, present and future. The following present prices were taken: $9.00  aM for white pine and -$6.00 (minus) for the secondary species. For  future prices the following: $20.00 for white pi~e and $1.50 for the  secondary species. Present tax rates of 10 cents per acre were used up  to 80 years, and 6 cents aM for white pine and 1! cents aM for secondary  species were used for the timber after it reached merchantable size. Cost  of protection was placed at 10 cents an acre. Cost of eradication was  taken from Western White Pine Blister Rust Proceedings for 1925 at $2.22  an acre for dense reproduction, $5.64 for open reproduction, $0.50 for  dense mature timber and $2. 57 for open mature timber. Using these data,  the calculations give the following tabulated results:  Net Profit per Acre at 100 Years  A. Present Stumpa ,.e Prices Used  Per cent of white  _Rine in stand Site I Site II Site III  80 $ 194.84 jll5.36 $ 39.10  60 32.63 -2.68 -34.76  40 -129.58 -120.71 -108.62  20 -291.79 -238.75 -182.48  B. Future St1.l.Ill]:2age Prices Used  80 $793.27 $551.05 $ 312.05  60 590.39 403.40 219.64  40 387.51 255.76 127.23  20 184.63 108.12 34.82  The variation in profits is due, of course, to changes in perÂ­centage  of white pine. The eradication costs and carrying charge are  exactly the same in all cases. Under these conditions, using present  stumpage prices, it would apparently pay to eradicate Ribes only in case the  percentage of white pine present is 56 per cent or over on Site I, 63 per  cent on Site II and 69 per cent on Site III. In using the future stumpÂ­age  prices here assumed, eradication would pay regardless of composition,  though the margin of profit would be greatly cut down in the case of low  percentages of white pine.  As understocked stands will also have to be dealt with in the  work, an example of that is here given in which the stocking is 50 per centof  -12-  normal. Figures for Site II only are given. In this case it would pay to  eradicate only if the stands contain 27 per cent or more of white pine.  Net Profit per Acre at 100 Years  Using Future Stumpage Prices  Stand 50% Stocked  Iercent.~.e of white p_ine Site II 80 $195.18  60 121.35  40 47.53  20 - 26.30  There are several matters to be pointed out in connection with  the above calculations. One is that the figures 8Dw the importance of deÂ­termining  the percentaga of white pine in the stand before eradication  and also the importance of knowing whether the percentage of th~s specie~  will increase or decrease as the stand advances in age~ What such changes are  are not known and no assu~tions can therefore be made in this connection.  This specifically is the point at which further study is needed.  A point that needs com~ent in the above calculations is that. the  carrying costs (taxes and protection) amount to a huge figure b,y the end  of the r otati on as c ompared with the cost of eradication compounded to  that time. The eradication costs here used have an end value of $5.32  for the less expensive eradic ~tion and $60.02 for the most expensive, .  whereas t he end value of taxes and protection amount t o .$112.63. Consid~  ering the figures as given, the natural conclusion would be that. the Â·  g~owing of timber as a private enterprise is not profitable under present  conditio u; except on the best sites, and then only in s tand..s containing  a high proportion' of white pinÂ·e . .. The sitUation is not as h'opeless as this,  however, f or the reas on that any private concern which owns enough timber  to stay perina.nently in businas=s, i. ~., to grow each year as much timber  as it cut's, would logically not be justified in carrying forward the proÂ­tection  and ta~es in this way, but would naturally charge them off curÂ­rently  as a part of the cost of running the business. In doing this it  would easily be profita)le to eradicate Ribes several times in the life  ~f the stand if necessaty. In the case of state and federal owned timber,  of c~uree. there are no taxes and the cost of ~rotection is not carried  forward as a charge against the final crop.  Another need is to determine the influence, if any, of various  compositions of species Â·in the stand upon the total yield per acre. Does  a Â·stand with 30 per cent \7hite pine and 70 per cent white fir, hemlock,  and cedar have a greater total yield than one in which the ratio, for  Â· example, is 70 per cent white pine and 30 per cent other species? There  are the combinations of white pine with intolerant associates such as  larch and Douglas fir, then there are the combinations of white pine with  -13-  more tolerant associates like cedar and hemlock. The Experiment StaÂ­tion  already has field data on this problem m ich, when it is compiled  will throw light on this problem. Another need is to kno~ what is the  best -s-to-cki""ng Â·to produc-e saw timberÂ·~ Â·This will be sol'!l'what less than  the full, or what we call notÂ·.nal stocking, which produces the maximum  cubic volume for a given site and age.  Classification of forest land into ~od. fair, and poor sites  will naturally be necessary in order to state which areas have high  productive capacity for white pine to make eradication feasible. AlÂ­though  site classification has not been undertaken on an extensive  scale on the National Forests, forest research has developed accepted  methods for site classification and this can therefore be carried out  in connection with Ribes eradication. Research methods are far enou&h  developed along this line to make this practicable.  II ASK ~ AUOTHER11  H. R. Offord (Chemical Eradicatien)  In the course of our field work we often encounter curious  people whose vague nebulistic idea concerning our work calls forth  all of our latent histrionic talents when they pop their questions.

Â· dety o:: Montana photo)  ROUTE OF THE MULLAN ROAD OVER THE BITTERROOT DIVIDE  by  Carl G. Krueger  Supervisor  Coeur d 'Alene National Forest  The ""Mullan Road"" is the popular name of the military road bet1veen  Fort Walla Walla, Washington and Fort Benton, Montana . The road was  built under the supervision of Lieutenant, later Captain, John Mullan,  U.S. Army, in 1858-1861. It was an important access route to and across  northern Idaho for many years. Much of its route parallels U.S . No . 10  and the new Interstate No . 90.  Through the years a misconception has grown regarding the route of the  Mullan Road over the Bitterroot Mountains between Mullan, Idaho and  Saltese, Montana . For some unknown reason, this seems to be more prevaÂ­lent  in Montana than Idaho. The misconception is unfortunate, since t he  record is so clear that there would seem to be no room for error .  Some records suggest that the original road was from Mullan, Idaho up the  main stem of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River, over the present  Mullan Pass and down Randolph Creek to the St. Regis River and Saltese,  Montana . The fact that the pass on the Bitterroot Divide is now called  Mullan Pass has perpetuated the error. Recently the United States  Geological Survey Saltese quadrangle, dated 1956, compounded this error;  it labels the road up Randolph Creek as the Old Mullan Road .  The route of the Mullan Road is easterly up the South Fork of the  Coeur d'Alene to the locality now known as Shoshone Park, where Mullan's  party had one of their work camps . There the road turns almost due  south, crossing the Bitterroots at the pass shown on Mullan's map as  Sohon's Pass, but now known as St. Regis Pass. That this pass has also  sometimes been called Mull~n Pass does not help clarify matters. It is a  short drop from this pass into the head of the St. Regis valley. The  road follows the St . Regis River past the mouth of Randolph Creek and on  to the Saltese area.  Records showing the correct route of the road are:  1. Mullan's report and maps, 1863.  2 . The Idaho-Montana Boundary Survey, 1904-1905 .  3.

MUIJ.A.N Is REPORT  The full title of this is ""Report on the Construction of a Military Road  from Fort Walla Walla to Fort Benton"" by Captain John Mullan, U.S.A. The  report was published by the Government Printing Office in 1863. It  includes four maps. The last of these is of the mountain section of the  road, roughly from Lake Coeur d'Alene to Missoula, showing clearly that  the Mullan Road leaves the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene several miles  west of the head of the river and runs south to Sohon's Pass and the head  of the St . Regis valley. Stevens Peak, named by Mullan, is accurately  shown on this map at the head of the St. Regis River and Sohon's (now  St. Regis) Pass. Randolph Creek, while unnamed, is identifiable on the  map. Lakes on the head of the St. Regis River are also shown.  Text of the report simply confirms the map. On page 31 Mullan describes  the betterment and reconstruction work done in 1861 easterly from Fort  Walla Walla: ""We built twenty heavy bridges on this river (The  Coeur d'Alene) which, together with the repairs in its valley, occupied  us until the 15th of September when, crossing the summit of the Bitterroot  Mountains, we reached the head sources of the St. Regis Borgia river, on  which a similar system was initiated."" Surely an explorer of Mullan's  ability, with the assistance he had, knew the difference between the head  of the river and one of its minor tributaries.  W. W. Johnson, Civil Engineer and assistant to Mullan, studied the route  from the standpoint of constructing a railroad. His report to Mullan is  on pages 118-123. Johnson states, ""The summit of the divide of the  Coeur d'Alene or Bitter Root Mountains at Sohon's Pass is four thousand  nine hundred and thirty two feet above the level of the sea, . . . and  thirteen hundred and fifty three feet above the last crossing of the  Coeur d 'Alene river; which last height is attained in an air line distance  of one and five hundreths miles . . The descent of three hundred and  ninety two feet from the summit, to the first crossing of the St. Regis  Borgia is made in seven tenths of a mile, in nearly a direct line, over  the natural surface of the mountain . . . There are two passes to the  north and east of Sohon 's Pass; the first two miles to the north ...  the second is some ten miles distant . The St. Regis Borgia river has  its rise in a small bowl-like lake 500 feet in diameter, carved by nature  out of the steep rocky walls of one of the spurs of Steven's Peak. After  leaving this spring it tumbles down JOO feet in a quarter of a mile,  through a narrow, rocky channel; after which it flows through a valley a  tenth of a mile in average width, to the first crossing.""  -3-  Illustration No. 2  The present St. Regis  the boundary survey .

However, the statement as to the two passes north and east is very good,  the nearer being the present Lookout Pass, the second the one now called  Mullan Pass, between the head of the South Fork of the Coeur d 1Alene and  Randolph Creek. If he had been at this second pass, no statement as  quoted above could have been made, as there are no passes into the  St. Regis drainage from the Coeur d 1Alene north of Mullan Pass. The stateÂ­ment  in regard to the source of the St. Regis is also conclusive; there  are no lakes in the Randolph Creek drainage.  Also in the report, beginning on page J09, are notations on a number of  meteorological observations at Sohon 1s Pass, frequently with comments  regarding the weather. For October 'Zl, 1859, it states, nNo snow among the  timber until 1000 feet above the pass. Steven 1s Peak, 2000 feet higher,  only a few snow patches near bushes n Stevens Peak is not visible  from any point in Mullan Pass.  THE IDAHO-MONTANA BOUNDARY SURVEY, 1904-1905  A contract was executed by the General Land Office February 10, 1904 for  the survey of the boundary line between the states of Idaho and Montana  by Howard B. Carpenter, U.S. Surveyor. The survey began June 6, 1904 and  was completed September lJ, 1905. Notes are on file in the Boise office  of the Bureau of Land Management.  Carpenter worked from north to south. At the 126th mile post he reached  the present Mullan Pass, and his notes read:  11set an iron pipe J ins. dia. 4 ft. long with flanges at the  bottom 2 ft. in the ground for 126th mile cor. A brass cap on  top of the pipe has raised letters MONT on E., IDA on W., a  raised x in the center and stamped 126M on N. Dug pits J6xJ6x18  inN., S., E., and W. of the corner 5 ft. dist.

July 5, 1904ll  Note that there is no mention of a road, or even a trail, through this  pass. Further on he comes to the present Lookout Pass. An iron pipe  similar to the one at mile 126 was set, this one being stamped 129.342 on  the NE, on the east side of the railroad. Then the notes read:  -5-  Illustration No. J  The Mullan Road at the mouth of Randolph Creek. GLO pl~t for Township  19N, RJlW. Note that the road does not go up Randolph Creek .

While the surveyor used the name Mullan Pass, which may have been rather  common at that time, there is no doubt as to where he was and that he was  referring to what is now called St. Regis Pass and that the road was the  Mullan Road.  To further verify the surveyor's notes, the plats prepared by Carpenter  as part of the survey do not show a road at MP 126, the present Mullan  Pass. They do show the railroad at Lookout Pass, and the wagon road, so  labeled, at Mullan (present St . Regis) Pass. This cannot be just an  oversight. The roads at Thompson Pass and Glidden Pass further to the  north are shown . Between mileposts 138 and 139 further south he refers  to a ""trail from Saltese to some mining prospects "" in his notes. We can  hardly think that Carpenter identified and platted these other roads, the  railroad and even trails, but overlooked a road in Mullan Pass, particuÂ­larly  a road as well known as the Mullan Road.  UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, PROFESSIONAL PAPER 62  The complete title of this publication is ""The Geology and Ore Deposits of  the Coeur d'Alene District, Idaho"" by Ransome and Calkins, published in  1908. On page 78 of this report Ransome gives a brief history of the area  and refers to the r oad built by Mullan and his party. After a brief  description of the r oute west of the town of Mullan he states, ""ThencE: it  ascended the main stream and South Fork to a point about 3 miles east of  the present town of Mullan. Here it turned southward, crossed the divide  through the Sohon or St . Regis Pass, and continued down St . Regis River .  Roughly constructed as it was, this highway, now familiarly known as the  'uld Mullan road' was for many years the only line of travel into the  region . . . The section. of the old road that crosses the divide east of  Mullan is still in occasional use and is shown on the accompanying topoÂ­graphic  map (Pl. 1, in pocket). rr  -7-  The road is shown on the map as stated, and the route coincides very well  with Mullan's original map. Fieldwork for this map was done in 1900-1901.  GENERAL LAND OFFICE SURVEYS, MAPS & FIELD NOTES  In Montana the route of the Mullan Road in the St. Regis valley is clearly  shown and labeled by name in many cases on the General Land Office townÂ­ship  plats . The plats involved in this particular area are:  Township 19 North, Range 31 West, Montana Meridian Approved 1899.  In this township the Mullan Road crossed Randolph Creek in the southeast  quarter of Section 7. The road is clearly plotted going up the river not  up Randolph Creek. Fieldwork for this was done in 1898.  Township 19 North, Range 32 West, Montana Meridian Approved 1916.  This plat shows the Mullan Road going up the St . Regis past Borax and  Sildex stations on the NPRR. It leaves the township in Section 6.  In Idaho the portion of the Mullan Road being discussed is on two township  plats.  Township 47 North, Range 6 East, Boise Meridian Approved 1914.  A road is shown entering Idaho from Montana in the approximate center of  Section 5, which is the location of St . Regis Pass . On this plat it is  labeled Mullan Pass, but the road is shown as Mullan - Saltese .  Township 48 North, Range 6 East, Boise Meridian Approved 1911.  The present Mullan Pass between the head of the South Fork of the  Coeur d'Alene River and St. Regis River via Randolph Creek is in  Section 36. The road shown on the plat coming easterly up the river from  Mullan ends near the west edge of Section 35, so no road is shown for  1-1/2 miles . In Section 32, a road is shown turning south at the site of  Mullan's camp, the area now known as Shoshone Park. This road connects  up with the one from St. Regis Pass shown on T.47N . , R6E . , as described  above. Clearly this was the through route, and the location agrees with  both Mullan's map and the map in the USGS Prof. Paper 62.  The various surveyors' notes again confirm the plats. As is standard  practice, the notes refer to streams, road or trail crossings, or other  features along the line run. In Idaho these surveys were not made until  20 or 30 years after intensive mining development had begun. There are  consequently many references to road and trail crossings, mines or other  human activities. The Mullan Road is not referred to by name. However,  as stated above, a road is shown going through St. Regis Pass, called  Mullan Pass . The notes confirm this .  -8-  In locating the line between Sections 34 and 35, T48N, R6E., the surveyor  refers to a road crossing just north of the quarter corner. The plat  shows this as ending at a mine near the west edge of Section 35. In  locating the line between Sections 35 and 36, which is just west of the  present Mullan Pass, there is no reference to a road, but there is referÂ­ence  to a trail, which also shows on the plat. This trail does not go  through the pass, but turns north in the western part of Section 36.  In MOntana where there was not the extent of development and the surveys  were also made earlier, the Mullan Road is usually referred to by name,  and its course could be roughly traced without the plats. For example,  while locating the line between Sections 14 and 15, Tl9N ., R31W . , the  surveyor noted that he crossed the Mullan Road 73.10 chains north of the  section corner. In this same township, in locating the lines between  Sections 6 and 7 and between 5 and 6, the surveyor noted that he crossed  Randolph Creek three times, referring to it by name in each instance .  There is no reference to a road at any of these three crossings, and as  stated earlier, no road is shown going up Randolph Creek on the plats.  In Township 19 North, Range 32 West, which lies west of Randolph Creek,  the surveyor also notes crossing the Mullan Road. In locating the line  between sections 11 and 12, he notes that he crossed the Mullan Road  49 .90 chains south of the section corner. Similarly between Sections  2 and 3, these and other references to the Mullan Road in the township  west of Randolph Creek should be conclusive information as to where the  road went without all the other supporting information.  THE COEUR D'ALENE NATIONAL FOREST MAP OF 1911  This map is part of President Taft's Proclamation of June 29, 1911  establishing the St. Joe National Forest . Up to this time the area had  been part of the Coeur d'Alene National Forest. The map itself was  probably prepared at least a year earlier. It shows a road over the  Bitterroot Divide and down the St. Regis River at what is St. Regis Pass  and no road or trail over the present Mullan Pass.  UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAPS  A series of Geological Survey maps of the area portray the changes in  roads over the years and explain some of the misconceptions as to the  original route.  U.S.G.S. Prof. Paper 62 shows the Mullan Road going over St . Regis Pass.  Fieldwork for this map was done in 1900-1901; the Prof . Paper is dated 1908.  An ""Idaho - Montana Coeur d'Alene Special Map"" printed in 1906 and  reprinted in 1916, shows a road over St. Regis Pass. It also shows a  secondary road- dashed symbol - up the South Fork toward Mullan Pass.  Unfortunately, the map stops just west of the pass. It cannot be deterÂ­mined  whether this road actually went into or through the pass or not.  -9-  A third map, the Avery quadrangle, edition of 1917, shows roads over both  passes .  An advance sheet of the Pottsville and vicinity, Idaho - Montana Map,  prepared in 1939, shows a trail over St. Regis Pass. This map does not  include Mullan Pass, but it is known that there was a road over Mullan  Pass before 1939, so this road would undoubtedly have been shown if the  map had extended that far .  The last in the series of maps is that for the Saltese Quadrangle, Idaho -  MOntana, published in 1956. This map shows a road over Mullan Pass and  not even a trail over St . Regis Pass which is correct as of the present  time. The unfortunate feature of this map is that the road up  Randolph Creek and over Mullan Pass is incorrectly labeled as the Old  Mullan Road. Since these maps are printed at infrequent intervals, this  error will be carried forward for many years. Because these maps are,  generally, accurate this error is given a high degree of authenticity.  It is hoped that in future map publications and in any historical articles  about the area, the location of the original Mullan Road will be correctly  portrayed . More positive action would be the correction of the plates for  the Saltese quadrangle by the U.S.G.S. This is the source from which the  error is most apt to be perpetuated . Erection of historical markers at  appropriate points would also help .  -10-  Always  break l matches  in two!  Crush  all  smokeS  dead!

PROTECTmN Il IDAHO  Forest fires know no property line.  Probably of this alone was born the  idea of cooperative forest protection  which many authorities consider one of  the greatest and most far reaching  steps ever taken in forestry and reÂ­lated  lines of endeavor.  . .  A little group of far sighted men -  F .A. Blackwell, J .P . McGoldrick, ~ .J.  Davies, and others - all int erested in  white pine stumpage in northern Idaho  after years of uncoordinated effort to  handle the fire problem, formed the :  . .  Coeur d'Alene Timber Protective Associ- :  ation in 1906. The aims of the new  organization are very completely and  briefly stated in Article One of the  Constitution and Bj -Laws~  ''The name of this Association  shall be Coeur d'Alene Timber ProÂ­tective  Associati on and its object  t he preservation of the forests o1  Idaho generally, and the district  tributary to Coeur d'Alene Lake,  particularly , from loss b ~ fire and  to ~nlist the aid of the United  States and State GoverP~ent in said  work . Also such other matters as  may be of mutual interest tb its  me~bers, and to encourage the enactÂ­ment  of such lru s as will best conÂ­serve  the objects to be attained.""  The aims set up in the beginning  have never been changed and cooperaÂ­tion  between the Association and the  State and Federal goverP~ents has beÂ­come  steadily clos er and more effectiveJ  The idea of cooperative forest pro Â­tecti  on was quickly grasped by other  Idaho timber owners, and the Pend  Oreille, Clearwater, Potlatch,  Priest Lake a11d Sout herr: I aha Timber  Protective Assocations have all  been formed long since and are  effect'ively functioning .  Foll6 ing Idaho's lead the idea  was taken up in other nor ih est ern  states, later in other states  and finally in the Canadian proÂ­vinces  until today with Associ Â­ations  still being f ormed the  Idaho idea has spread from co~t  f\ to coast on a scale hardly equalled  in any ot1er line of cooperative  endeavor .  It should be a matter of great  pride to Idaho people that an  Idaho idea has s pread to .such magÂ­nificient  proportions.

Not t he least interesting  and encouraging feature of t 1.e As s o-:  ci at ion 10 rk in I daho has be en the :  intel ligent and he lpful cooperation :  o6 the state officials. For nearly :  t wenty years those officials inÂ­trusted  with the care of the State's:  own timber resou rces - the Governor,:  Attorney General, Superintender~ t of  Public Instruction, Secretary of  State and State Auditor, together  composi ng the St at e Board of Land  Commissioners - have delegated the  actual work of forest protection to  the several Protective A ~ociations  in exactly the same manner as other :  large timber owners. And through the  Hctive part1cipation of t he State  Land Commis ~ ion e r and his assistants:  the Btate itself has been in the  clo ses t touch with the work .  Under such a comprehensive  scheme of protection possibly the  publicity feature has been largely  ov erÂ±ooked. It is regrettable in  the extreme that Idaho people are  not better informed of the ways and  means in which their own property is  being c ar ed f or and the welfare of  the different communities insured.  Every Idaho citizen who has any  feeling of t 1e r esponsibilities of  citizenship should learn the facts  and tell others, should set an  example of c are and prudence in his  own use of fire in the mountair.s  and should be ever on the watch to  lend his aid to those c arrying the  brunt of the fire fighting work.

So far as can be ascertained, this  establiahment took place ~rom long distance spread of aeciospores. It was first  discovered in 1928. During the seasons of 1928Â·19309 licl~ve ; u6 19cal centers  of pine infection were found. During the first half of the ~mner season of 1931â€¢  24 other centers of pine infection were discovered, making a total of 40. J~om the  rate at which these centers of pine infection are now being discovered it is  obvious that the wbite pine type of the Inland Empire is, over its greatest part,  potentially infected with the rust and that the rate of damage will rapidly  accelerate from this time forward.  Two infection areas now known in north Idaho are indicative of conditions  which may be generally expected over the white pine belt when the rust has had  sufficient time to develop to a similar degree in ~umerous localities. The first  of these areas, known as the Long Meadow Infection Area, is near Elk River, Idaho.  Infection evidently originated upon the area in 1923 and is known to occur over  approximately 48 acres of an uneven aged stand of white pine. A 4~ cruise of the  area showed that 18' of the pines upon this 48 acres are now infected with blister  rust, with an average of 14 cankers per infected tree. The Ribes eradication which  has been done upon this area will stop the fonnation of new pine infectiqns within  the limit of the eradicated area, but will not prevent the spread of aeciospores  to Ribes in more distant points, therebj setting up further new pine infection  centers.  The second area of heavy infection has recently been discovered in  Fishhook Creek on the St. Joe Nat~onal Fore~t . A preliminar.y scouting of this  area ShOWS it to be apprOXimately 100 acres in extent With an average of 250 pines  -1-  per acre, of which 50 to 75' are now infected. Original infection on this area  seems to have taken place in 1923, thus showing th&t under conditions similar to  those existing in many parts of the Inland Empire white pine belt 50 to 75~ of the  pines can show infection within eight years from the time of original infection  within an ereae  Local centers of pine infection are generally only found after considerÂ­able  intensification has developed about local points, making it pr~cticable to  locate them by scouting. Generally speaking, the amount of rust which develops  on Ribes the year of initial infect.ion from long distance spread is so meager on  the aven:.ge wild Ribes bush that it cannot be found b~ aJlÂ¥ intensification of  scouting that we could afford to do. The initial Ribes infection results from a  single aeciospore which infects only a part of one or possibly several Ribes plants  at the most in millions of such plants. The odds against finding one of these  points are so great as to be beyond practical consideration. The infection centers  are not found as a rule until the rust has spread to a considerable extent locally  as a result of aeciospores produced on pine from the initial or subsequent Ribes  infection.  The accompanying map shows, in red hachure, the area of white pine type  over which numerous Ribes infections occur. These R\bes infections occur as local  spots, frequently of heavy infection, often several in a single ~rainage. In many  cases they are not as yet known to be accompanied b~ pine infection, but the presence  of the rust on these Ribes will in many cases result in local pine infection, if  this has not already taken place.  The red dots represent those locations at which pine infection has been  found.  A summation of the knowledge now available regarding the extent of white  pine blister rust infections now present in the Inland Empire white pine beltâ€¢  shows first, that 40 centers of pine infection are now known to exist; second, that  numerous other centers undoubtedly exist which it has not been possible to locate  by ~ reasonable degree of scouting; third, that the rust can within a relatively  few years rapidly develop within end out and from a new focus of infectfon; fourth~  that under conditions existing in this region, western white pines very rapidly  become infected; fifth, that because of the extent end condition of infections  now known to exist, and because of the large acreage to be covered and the diffiÂ­culties  invo~ved in eradicating Ribes over the terrain concerned, only the most  rapid, thoroughly organized and most aggressive efforts can save this large area of  western white pine from very heavy damage within the next decade.  Status~ Local Control Work  Experimental local control in the Inland Empire was first undertaken in  1922. The work was entirely experimente.l in nature until 1928 when the first co ...  operative control operation was started. The following is a brief history of the  work thus far accomplished: The area numbers refer to numbers on the map.  Area fl. Work done in 1922 in the vicinity of Elk River, Idaho.

Of this total 390,043 acres were worked prior to 1931 , and  209,550 acres will be treated during the 1931 season. From the amount of pine in-fection  now known to exist in this region and from the rate of intensification now  taking place, it was determined in 1930 that the three million acres of \Vhi te pine  type land would have to be protected within the next ten years if serious damage  is to be averted. This would mean that 300,000 acres per year should be given  protection in order to prevent this damage . Durin~ the first year of this decade  -5-  only approximately 200,000 acres will be treated. The rate of progress in the  western control program must be increased by fifty per cent if the purpose of the  work is to be accomplished.  SPREAD OF THE RUST AND DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CONTROL IN OTHER PARTS OF THE  FAR '.VES'.r  In addition to the rapid spread ~~d intensification of white pine  blister rust in the Inl~nd Empi re this disease is also spreading rapidly through  the coast region of Oregon and Washington. Ribes infections have been found on the  southern coast of Oregon only fifty miles north of the California border. A local  but intensified area of pine infection is known to exist upon the Santiam National  Forest, Oregon, lying upon the west slope of the Cascade Mountains. I t is to be  expected that the rust will be found in California within the next few years and  the large area containing sugar pine will then be directly threatened by the rust .  Experimental local control work in Oregon has been carried on at two  points. One on the Still Creek area, Mt. Hood National Forest and one near  Prospect, Oregon on the Crater National Forest . Both operations are experimental  in nature, have been carried out upon national forest l9.Uds and are designed to  develop specialized methods of Ribes eradication to meet the local conditions  involved. During the course of this work the Ribes have been removed from 3 , 857  acres of land bearing white and sugar pine ..  Experimental local control has been under way i n California since 1926  and has been centered upon the Stanislaust Plu~as and Lasson National Forests.  At the close of the present season approximately 33,000 acres will have been  cleared of Ribes.

Hubert  Acting Dean, School of Forettr7. University of Idaho  The Spr!Â§d of the Rust  It ia now twenty-two years since the first introduction of the white  pine blister rust into Vancouver, B.C. and about nine years since the first  establishment of the rust at widely separated po1nta in the Inland Bmpire.  !he first infection on White pin~ in Idaho can be traced to the year 1923, the  infection being discovered five years later. During the period 1928-1930 a  number of pine infection centers were found in Idaho and during 1931 a great  one  ~more were discovered, bringing the total up to sixty/. A total of ~5 new  c~t a~s were found in 1931. At the rate of increase noted during the seasons  of 1928 to 1931 inclusive, it might be safe to predict that 1932 will .disclose  someWhere near 100 pine infection centers. The rapidity of spread indicated  by the above rate of increase of pine infection centers and the rapid develop-ment  of the rust on the pines r.1 thin these centers point to an unusually vig-orous  invasion of the white pine belt in Ida.bo . .U least there are certain  ueas such as the one on tong J..!eadow Creek near Elk River , I daho and a recentÂ­a  ly discovered one on 11Shhook Creek near Avery, Idaho. which ahow/very large  percentage of trees infected and a large number of cankers per tree.  rhe Division of Blister Rust Control has found by e. preliminary scout-ing  of the Fishhook Creek infection lll'ea. comprising about 100 acres on the  approximately  St. Joe National Forest that/50~ per cent of the 25,000 trees on this  area. show infection. This a:J10unt of infection has developed within a period  of g years , beginning in 1923, the year of .original infection. .An analysis  - 2-  infection on this area indicates that the cariker increase ~ been at the rate  of appro::dmatel7 3,000 cankers of 1926-28 origin for each canker started in  1923. The ratio of canker increase is not eo great on the other pine -infection  fU""&as but the fact mu.st be borne in mind that the 61 centers alrea.Ccy' located are  bu.t a small percentage (perhapa 1 per cent) of the actual number of centerâ€¢  scattered o~er many miles of rugged territor,.  The usual speed at which the rust has worked in the Idaho region during  this period is startling, part1eularl;r so when we find that eome of the yean  within this period were noted for subnormal precipitation. Another interesting  observation made b7 E. L. Joy and his co-workers indicateâ€¢ that the wild black  Ctlrrant (E. petiolare) is the host of greatest illlportance in initiating the inÂ­fection  centers and that the other species of Ribes are responsible for a conÂ­siderable  amount of spread from these infection centera. .A. single aec1oapore  carried in from a distant point 'l'1Jiq readily cause infection on the wild black  currant. The 1ntensif1eat1on of the disease on this atresm type of Ribee proÂ­gresses  rapidly and infection soon spreads to the nearb7 treea and from thea~  after three or fou.r- years to the upland Ribea. :By the Â· time the telial stage  of' the ruat is produced the infection has epread far up the slopes on Ribes  other than R. petiolare. It ie evident, therefore, that these aeatteredupÂ­land  Ribas unqueâ€¢tionably plq a prominent part in spreading the infection to  a large number of pines o~er a large area. Given a con.entration of hearlly  infected stream type Ribas with a scattering of upland Ribea on the elopes  abo~e and the scene is laid for the rapid and extend ~e spread of the disease  from creek bottom to ridge.  Another interesting obse""ation regarding the apread of \he ru.st 1n Idaho  indicates that the rust 1a found developing beat in areas where moieture conditions  appear to be most favorable and where eddies occur in the air currents. With the  - 3 -  exception of the lleWIDIUl Lak~ are~ in eastern \1ashingtcn, :1ll of the pinft it~.-  fection centers seem to occur in a.reaa wbiC"".h ere classified. 9S optimal dtes  for Western white pine.

A considerable acreage of timoerland owned by the  state of Idaho has been worked over for the removal of Ribes plants during the  past few years and additional acreage will be treated 1n 1932.  - 5-  In the Montana region a very intensive control area has been laid out  for e. radius of a mile ar-ound the Forest Service :nursery at Haugan. where thous-and.  s of White pine seedlings are grown ee.ch year for use on the plantation areaa  1n the Yontana. &nd Idaho :forests. Another nursery in whlch cousideranle quanti-tiea  of white pine ~e grown is the S~ool of Forestry nursery and arboretuw at  Moscow, Idaho, which bas been gone over re~larly for the past :few rears t:nd the  zone  nurser, as well as a wide protection/surrounding it has been freed from Ribes.  During the past two years new methods of attack have evolved .fro:n the  practical field experience and field investigations and from the resear~~ lao-oratories.  Many improvements have been made in the use of ert:ws on an area. in  the type of eqo.ipment used in the spr~ing prog:ram and iu .,he tuethods of c:Ueck-ing  resnlts. New chemicals and concentrations have been tested ar1d a st~~ m3de  of the e:freet on the Ribes plants of various concentrations of chemical$ appl!ed  to the roots in the soil. An interesting and promising method for eradicating  Ribes on certain stream bottom lands has been proposed by c . H. Johnson. blister  rust state leade~ for Montana. ~De method involves tne use of a bulldozeT type  of tractor in scraping off and piling up in windrows for subsequent b-llrning, all  refuse including bruSh and llibea bushes. 'l'he area thus cleared. is to be som1  to euitA.ble forage gra!!ses wd maintalnod for grazing purposes. It is cliil.imed  that tbis methcd is practicable and within reasonable cost.

The rapid spread of the rust to pine in Idaho has greatly stii.riU.l.ated in-terest  in studies on the life blsto1Â·y o! ti1e t""ll.st and on the influencing factors.

III Issued by No. 8 and 9  The School of Forestry, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idano  THE FIRE SEASON OF 1926 IN IDAHO  ByÂ­Howard  R. Flint  U. S. Forest Service, District l.  (Note: - Publishers using the contents , in part or entire, of this bulÂ­letin  are requested to credit the School of Forestry, University of  Idaho, as well as the author of the article.)  In northern Idaho the spring of 1926 opened with subnormal snowfall and rainÂ­fall.  A quotation from a letter sent out by the District Forester at Missoula to  all National Forest officers in northern Idaho is, perhaps, significant of the  uneasiness which prevailed about April 30 among those most concerned with  forest fire control:  ""Reports from the Forest Experiment Station and from Savenac Forest  Nursery show that forest fire danger is developing rapidly under  prevailing conditions. Rainfall for the months of March and April  is far below normal. Maximum temperatures have been up around 80  degrees-summer temper ature, with relative humidities as low as 18  per cent at Priest River . As a consequence all of the lighter  weight and smaller fuels are becoming dangerously inflammable. The  moisture content of the top layer of duff at Savenac Nursery (near  the Idaho-Montana line) was down to 15 per cent on April 26 and  appears to be falling rapidly . Twigs and slash probably are as  dry or drier than top duff.  Such unusual conditions at this season of the year warrant unusual  attention to the fire problem. You are urged to take active measures  in regulating all spring burning wherever possible, and to watch  the weather and weather forecasts very keenly eo that you may be  prepared if unseasonable thunderstorms occur. Several lightning fires  have been reported. In all, 23 fires have been renorted in the DisÂ­trict  for the period ending April 20. This is greatly in excess of  any previous record for the entire month of April. If materials conÂ­tinue  to dry out at the present rate, future fires can be expected to  spread with dangerous rapidity.""  The pertinence of the foregoing warning is further borne out by the  following tabulation of precipitation:  Precipitation at Priest River Experiment Station  Year April May June July August September  1925 l.24 2.19 l. 70 0.96 1.12 l.68  Normal 1.96 2.18 l.64 0.91 xl.33 l. 73  1926 0.70 2.06 0.85 0.16 4.24 2.40  1926 Departure from  Normal -1.26 -0.12 - 0.79 - 0.75 +2.91 +0.67  x All received after August 15.  ..... Some t1mely rains in May and ear:y June together with lush growth of spring  vegetation temporarily relieved the situation, ut at no one time during the season  until August .16 did the sum total of precipitavi0n again approach normal. In the  southern part of the State, fire conditions because of a difference in climatic typ~  and forest cover types, never become so acute and dangerous as in l.e Panhandle,  E,n 1926 developed nothing unusual so th of the St. Joe River rll'ainae;e. This  in spite of the fact that very seriou fire danger conditions oft~n develop in the  Clearwater, Selway, and Salmon River drainages in north central Idaho. Serious  losses were confined to the Priest River, Kootenai River, and Pend Oreille Lake  localities.  Although a number of early fires occurred they v.& t1 less disastrous than  those of the spring of 1924. June 8 was an extremely bad day because of high  winds following a period of warm dry eaâ€¢her. A prcn~unced duet storm and gale  w~s in evidence throughout the day and during the afternoon a number of fires  spread. The most serious and destructive was in Grouse Creek about 25 mileA northÂ­easterly  from Sandpoint. This fire covered over 1200 acres and although the loss  in merchantable timber was not great there was a heavy loss in decked legs and legÂ­ging  improvements. A careless emoker employed in a nearby loeging camp is beÂ­lieved  to have been responsible for this destructive fire. Extreme weather did  not long continue and the other fires which sprung ~P on June 8 were controlled  without serious lessee. No further serious trouble with fire was xper:enced  until July 5. In this interval, all protection forces were built up to nor-mal  and placed ln readiness for tho danger season then reconized as already in  progress.  On July 5, dry thunderstorms broke over the northern panhandle, leaving  at least 300 fires in the region from Salmon River to the Canadian boundary.  In spite of drouth and heat all of these fires were successfu:ly handled by the  protective agencies and none became large. In the Priest Lak region with 65  fires from this storm the Priest Lake Timber Protective Associatlcn and the KanÂ­iksu  National Forest forces ware severely taxed, but they held, and ,,are safely  on top of the situation on July 11.  July 12, t;he most severe lightning-fire storm ever experienced in nineÂ­teen  years of record broke over the Priest Lake region and extended with less  severity over other parts of the panhandle. At least 425 fires are known to  have been set by lightning in a twelve-hour period.  On the Kaniksu Forest where a record has been kept for 19 years the greatÂ­est  number of lightning fires recorde:l. in any previous y ar is !01. This one storm  left in its path in about 12 hours over 150 fires which were actually located and  reported. It is knovn that some f~res not discovered and not 1eported at the  time were enveloped by others that became large. Dry, hot, windy weather folÂ­lowed  ~uly 12 and in general ~revailed until August 16, when g~ne~al rains inÂ­tervened.  The local forces, already somewhat strained and partly occup~ed en the  fires of July 5 were wholly inadequate to meet the situation. All available  logging crews and other local labor supplies were c~lled into action and in the  evening of July 12 the recruiting of em rgency firefighters on a large Â·ecale  was started in Spokane. In spite of all efforts many fires became relatively  large and passed out of control during the next fsw days. A prolongF.d and  desperate fight ensued during the next six weeks. It is not known ~ust heÂ·  many men we-re engaged by the different organizations but it is fairly certain  that at leasâ€¢ 2500 were engaged in fire control in the Panhandle at one time  during the peak of the emergency. The story of cost:s and losses is best told  by tre accompanying tabulation. Further checking of the figures will change  them but little and are approximately correct:  -2-  ..

Important questions which naturally ar1ee out of such a record of coste and  losses are:  l. Ie it possible successfully to protect these forests from excessive  lose by fire?  2 . What steps can and should be taken to prevent a recurrence?  In answer to the first question it may be helpful to consider the record or  previous similar years. In 1910, the worst yeâ€¢r of record, costa and losses in  Idaho totaled $17,700 ,000 and 78 persons were burned to death. In 1919, another  peak year, costs and losses aggregated $5,098,000. For 1926, costa and losses are  $1,803,800. Each of the earlier peak years was followed by a substantial strengthÂ­ening  of the protection forces.  The figures, supported by the observations and experience of many fire-conÂ­trol  men indicate that it probably is within the scope of human possibility to preÂ­vent  heavy fire losses in the Idaho Forests. The same sources of information indiÂ­cate  clearly that ~uccess has not yet been attained. There is a wide margin in  which a further increased outlay in fire contr ol forces may reasonably be expected  to pay a handsome return. Prominent lumbermen and other public spirited citizens  of Idaho have already urged upon our representatives in Congress and upon the Bureau  of the Budget this pressing need. The request is not necessarily one for more  -3-  . Â·â€¢ mcney but is rat t. r for mor . flexibility in the use o{ funds to make it poseible to  p~t o ~ t a larg_ r p~ o 1e c~Â·~n fu r ca withÂ· vie ~ to pr venting fir~s from bacoming  4rg~. n ultiwat~ a~v~ug dhoula rdBUl~ .  If there is an answor to the lightning fire problem it ie  coda when fires start and higher efficiency among those men. ""  or promised ~ay to prevent the occurrence of llghtning fires.  ""more men i n the  There is no known  Wi~h so many large !ires and such enormous suppression costs it is quite natÂ­ural  that attbntion should turn tcward more eff1cient means than hand labor for  thv construction uf fire trenches . That is a laudacle and encouraging tendency.  'fhe eliminatio of waste is always desirable. Horses, plows, anc1 pumps have all  been introd~Gad and all given prom1se of buing of some value in the construction  or holding cf f1re trench on large fires. While these improvements in method are  -worthy of further development it must be borne in mind that the real answer liee in  another direction. Each large fire is in itself a. monument to failure, even though  :t may be t.ver et- well handled. The . only real way to the practice of forestry in  Idaho is through the squelching of fires before they ever become large, cost l y,  and destructive. That way only promisee true success.  During 1926 fire research work was continued, a fire weather specialist was  nesigned to the north Idaho region by the U. S. Weather Bureau, and aerial forest  patrol in co-operation with the U S. Army wae continued. All of thesg are proÂ­mising  lines of forest protection in which work is but well begun.  I-D-AH-O- F-O-R-E-ST- SCHOOL EXPANDS ITS NURSERY ----- ------ -- ------  The lease of a 1wenty -seven acr~ tract givee the School of Forestry about  forty acres for its forest nursery and arboretum. The most of this area will evenÂ­l~  ally be used for forest nursery purposes, and when fully developed the School wil l  have one of the largest state controlled forest nurseries in the west.  The newly acquired leasehold adjoine the city limite of Moscow on the south  ~nd the university campus on the east. ln point of situation, eoil and topogÂ­raphy  the Â·~ract is splendidly adapted to forest nursery purposes Being adjacent  to the campus, it will be an inexpensive matter to supply this tract with water  from the university system.  The tract will be used primar1ly to grow planting etock for the establishment  of farm woodlots, shelter belts and windbreaks ~nder a cooperative agreement between  the School of Forestry and the U. Â·s. Forest Service according to the terms of the  federal law known as the Clarke-McNary act. This agreement will make it possible  for the School to supply the farmers of the state with planting material at very  nominal prices.

Durint; this period , lightning  started more than 200 fires in Nor-th Ic;laho , v1hich were found and put out by  the protective forces. It is known that d1~ing this time , many other  lightning fires started under such unfavorable burning conditions that they  wenÂ·~ out before being reached by the control forces and v1ere , therefore , not  r eported .  ~â€¢D of these lightning fires , one far up to Â¥~rd the head of the Selway  River, the other in the Lochsa drainage reached areas of about 800 acres each ,  and vrerc contr0lled at considerable effort and cost . Being in areas that  were naturally lightly timbered or which were pr eviously burned over in  1919 , the loss was very small .  Throughout the month of Augu.st, and during early September , thunder  storms ':vi th violent electrical di sclerges were ' of unusually freq_uent ocurrence ,  and GTeat n~~bers of lightning fires resulted.

Hubert  Professor of Forestry, School of Forestry, Univ. of Idaho.  pltrod. uciio:g .  To sum up accurately the forest disease situation in an area au~  as the Pacific Northwest is a task requiring the use of the tabuloua  seven league boots in covering the territory and a magical ""nose"" for  scenting out the incipient attacks of na.ly introduced or epidemic typea  of disease hidden in almost inaccesaible places. Lacking these necessities,  however, a reasonably accurate analysis of the situation based on our  present knowledge may be made. And as the subject develops you may find  much that discloses a distinctly optimistic trend in our forest disease  and wood disease situation.  Tree diseases, measured by the total damage, produce a less spec-tacular  effect than most of the types of damage, such as those reaulting  from fire, insect attack or windthrow. While fire eats its way rapidly  through a stand and in its wake leaves an annual loss of startling  proportions, yet the control ot tire ie prtmarily concerned with keeping  the loss at a minimum and, unlike certain tree diseases, there is little  danger of the coaplete destruction or a species of valuable timber over  its entire range. If the blister rust or eimilcr agency should gain the  upper hand in the struggle for forest protection, our western white pine  foresto would virtually be doomed.  The ~est has not been asleep, however, and I wish to summarize briefly  the progress made in fighting blister rust and other diseases which either  1 Presented before the Western Forestry and Conservation Association, March S,  1930, Portland, Oregon.  white pine stands ot Idaho. During 1929 an extensive center ot pine inÂ­fection  was discovered near Elk River, Idaho. This area covers about 60  acres of young and valuable timber. During the year numerous infections  on Ribea were found scattered throughout the white pine belt, extending to  its southern limit in the Clearwater river region. In general, it may be  said that, potentially, the white pine belt in Idaho is infected with the  rust .  Although an invasion has occurred, the counter-attack has already  begun aDd in 1929 we find that 21,500 acres or tUDber land in the Clearâ€¢  water region and 57,010 acres or timber land in the Potlatch region ot  Idaho have already been protected by the large-scale application of the  chemical eradication aethod to the Ribea plants growing along the streama,  supplemented by a certain amount of eradication by hand pulling the bushâ€¢â€¢ â€¢  Such a statement merely presents the results in concrete form and in no way  gives a picture of the immense amount of work involved ih the development ot  the methode now in use.  Through research, the Blister Rust Office has discovered a chemical  which when sprayed on the leaves kills certain Ribea bushes outright, and  work is now in progress to develop additional chemicals which will accompliah  a similar result with the other speciea of Ribas. Contrary to common opinion,  all or this work is not of the sheltered laboratory type. A great amount ~  *' involves roughing it in the mountains so that practical teats may be aade  in the timbered areas. Problema of transportation; building ot trailaJ  development ot methodâ€¢ to carry large quantities ot chemicals and equipaent  into remote places; the best deeigna and layout for the spraying linea, aDd  tor portable pumps; methoda of laying out the area before work commencea;and  methods or checking the work to determine ita efficiency halâ€¢ all been aet  and satisfactorily solved by the blister rust workera. A type ot one~,  portable knapsack sprayer mounted on a modified Nelson trapper board with a  -4-  bandâ€¢pump attached has been developed tor use in regions where power  spraying by meant ot gasoline pumps is impracticable. Tbese improvements  and discoveries coupled with the developmeut of more efficient methods or  handling eradication crewe in the most difficult terrain increases our  confidence in the beliet that the control methods when properly applied will  check the disease. To complete a hopeful picture it is found that these  same improvements and discoveries are gradually lowering the cost of eradiÂ·  cation and bringing it within reasonable limits. Where the esttmated cost or  control on an experimental baste in 1922 near Elk Hiver was around $1.44  per acre, the actual cost in 1929 ot chemical eradication on an average area  such as the Potlatch operation was but $3 cents per acre. Both of these  areas represent the stream type of eradication containing large quantitlea  of highly susceptible Hibes.  There is additional cause tor optimism in the theory recently developed  that selective cutting of t~bered areas discourages the development of  certain Hibea plants on those areas. The residual stand if dense enough may  thus help to shade out ambitious ~ibes plants and may also aid in reduciaa  the fire hazard. To complete the picture, the next field season will open  with an increased budget available for use in greatly extending the amount ot  local control work which will be applied to the white pine forests of Idaho.  ~~~~~~~Hr~~aa~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~â€¢  'lbe Larch Canker  Good news has reached us thia year through the statements made recently  by Dr. H. Yetcalf of the Office or Forest Pathology. It will be recalled that  much concern was expressed last year by Pacific Coast foresters and lumbermen  over the possible introduction of the larch canker disease into the magnificent  stands of Douglas fir timber. You will also recall that this disease had been  -5-  introduced into this country from Europe where it has aade the growing of  larch almost ~possible. this disease gained a foothold in Yassachueetts  and Rhode Island on planted Douglas fire aDd other conifers and was cauaiag  serious damage. Vigorous action on the part of Federal and state agencies  resulted in an 1ntens1~e caapatgn of scouting and eradication with the  result that two to three thousand infected trees ha-.e been destroyed and  a network of scouts thrown out to discover any new infections. with such  speedy removal of infected trees and the careful inspection of the remaining  susceptible conifers in the infected and adjoining zones, there ia little  likelihood of the dieeaae spreading. A warning must be sounded, howe""Yer  to guard against the chance introduction into the Pacific Coast forests of  shipments of conifer stock from the eastern part of the United States where the  disease may still be prevalent and difficult to detect. Such a loophole as  this one presented us with the blister rue'\ and it il just such loopholes  that quarantine regulations are efficient in pluggiag.  inter InJury  Turning now from the parasitic type of. disease to a type which 1e  produced by abnormal weather conditions, we find much to interest the holder  of timber or the forester operating in the Pacific Northwest region. It  has often been stated that a man may not see the forest because of the trees.  Those of us who are very close to the forests frequently do not see and  interpret all the changes taking place therein.  During 1924 to 19301 there .are on record certain years in which -.arioul  types of winter injury have been quite cOMmon in the coniferous foreata.  These typea of injury are characteriaed mainly by the reddish discolorat1oa  of the foliage over the entire tree or on the southerly side of the crown.  Again it may express itself by the discoloration and death of the tops of  young trees exposed above the snow line. The first type, known as ""red belt"",  injures a large number of trees by retarding their growth, but is moat oaae1  new needles develop and the trees recover. In the second type, known as  ""sun scorch"", the tope are killed due to a rapid thaw in the presence ot  sunlight, and the tree assumes a scrubby dwarfed shape. These types ot  injury are widespread in years when weather conditions favor such diseases,  and we find that, in general, rapid thawing accompanied by bright sunlight  or warm winds, following low winter temperatures are responsible for the  damage. In 1929 widespread injury, due to sun scorch )extending froâ€¢ British  Columbia through ~ashington, Idaho, and Uontana, was common on exposed  young trees of the various species of conifers. In 1924-1925 the red belt  type of disease waa common over a similar area~  In red belt there is usually a more uniform discoloration of trees over  a large area. 'l.'be trees frequently show eign~ ot having been killed but  under careful observation it is noted that most ot them develop new needlea  and soon recover.  Although the above emphasizes caution in developing an alarmist  attitude toward tree diseases and the resulting losses, yet a certain aaount  of over-anxiety is sometimes of value. rt is this sense which may some day  save us a great deal of post mortem grief by preventing the introduction  and development of potentially damaging diseases. 'there are certain  parasitic needle, branch and trunk diseases which must be watched from year  to year. Some of these have been brought to your attention by foresterâ€¢  and pathologists familiar with our western situation.  The mistletoe disease is; fortunately, one easily controlled on logging  areas or near nurseries, since the cutting ot the infected tree tills the  mistletoe plant and prevents further spread of the disease from that  particular .source. This, as you know, is not the case with heartrots and  the numerous diseases caused by fungi. In many cases a greater spread or  the disease is brought about by cutting down a heart rotted tree and leaYing  tt upon the moist and shaded ground where numerous conks may develop,  produce thousands of spores whi ch act as sources for new infections in the  neighboring stand.  The froblem of Decay in Wood  Since forest pathology also includes wood pathology or a study ot  the causes and control of the deterioration of wood by organic agencies,  t see no good reason why a few statements on this subject would not be of  interest to foresters and lumbermen, particularly since these observations  may contain additional justification for an optimistic outlook.  The decay of standing timber, as well as the decay and stain of wood  products in storage or in use, are Froblems which ahould draw the attention  of lumbermen at e. time when the prevention of such waste would mean much  in this year of ""cafeteria prosperity"", a year in which the buoiness man  must '*go and get lt"". J(uch has been accomplished by studies of the heal""tÂ­itmS  rot diseases of treesJ by investigatGPe into the cause and control of blue  stain and by studies on the cause and control of decay in wood products.  In some oaaes forest sanitation can be brought about by certain methode ot  forest management, but aa our virgin stands disappear, shorter cutting oyclea  become the rule and more and more produc~s are made from young trees of  relatively small eize, we will find that pathological cutting cycles will  eventually eliminate a large amount of the heartrot losses. The step from  lumber to derived products and to synthetic products from wood pulp ie not  great and the future will soe lumber and other wood products manufactured  from pul p obtained from smal l treos and young stands. A stand cu~ in its  youth has developed Httle heartrot and no fungous fruiting bodies. It,  therefore, leaves no great legaoy of disease to the oncoming stand and  suffers but slightly from cull due to decay. But a stand cut in its later  years carries with it an accumulation of heartrot and of conks which in turn  spread infection to the oncoming forest. The financial risk of carrying a  stand of timber 40 to 60 years when contrasted vitn the risk of carrying it  100 or more years leaves but one choice - favoring the shorter cutting cycle.  Wood preservation and sanitary measures are rapidly developing protection  against decay ot wood products and the study of blue stain in wood has yielded  many new facts of value in the prevention ot blue stain as well as in the  utilization ot blued lumber. Many of the fallacies which Â·bewe caused u~ to  ignore or discard useful wood products are rapidly disappearing before the  new light of careful in.eetigation.  e can well afford to examine the developments 1n other industriee,  borrow a page from the industrial chemistâ€¢â€¢ notebook and begin to apply 1ome  of the newer ideas ot utilization to the forest aDd its products. ror many  years chemists and bacteriologists have put their head~ together aBd evolved  simple, economical chemical processes in which same organism was used to  produce a valuable chemical or by-product from a mass of raw material. 1 have  traced down more than fifteen such processes ranging from the manufacture of  alcohol, acetic acid, gallic acid, the ratting of flax, down to the production  or ensilage on the farm. through the use of tiny organisms powdered wood may  now be converted into commercial lactic and acetic acid. Chat is to prevent  the development of such an idea applied to our present problems?

The average yearly cut of lumber in Idaho is  about 800 million feet, worth about $30,000,000.  2. Twenty-four million dollars of this remai ~ ~ at  home to the be nefit of community busir.ess, of which about  $18,000,000 goes for labor.  3. The lumber industry employs about t wo-thirds  of the State's industrial workers and produces about oneÂ­half  of all its manufactured products.  4. It pays yearly about $1 , 000 , 000 in t axe s amountÂ­ing  in many counties to from 30 to 60 per ce nt of all t axes  paid.  5. Idaho consumes less than one-fourth of its  lumber-cut, the other t hree-fourths be i ng s~Â· ::..pr,ed out,  l argely to eastern states, bri nging to the state some  $20,000,000 in payment therefor.

At this rate  the private timber Jill last abcut 35 years, although the  industry will soon be on the wane in many communities. The  Government and State FoÂ·zests cannot at prese nt supply more  than a portion of the prese nt cut, but if all of Idaho 1 s  forest l ands were under high class management, the industry  could be peTmane:-ntly susta1.ned, even on an increased basis.  ~he decline will be more serious by regions~ The  timber tributa,ry to Spokane in North Idaho will go first, and  here the loss ~nll be felt kee nly in 20 years or l ess .  The cut from the national ?crests may be expected  to increase very materially , but due to the policy of the  Government to cut only as fast as the timber grows, it will  only take up t he slash Ln part. Dot only will i ndustry sufÂ­fer,  but taxes on logging and milling equipment and on standÂ­ing  timber will shrink to a point t ha t will seriously affect  the local governments.. Many cities will lose a part of their  population.  Twenty-five per cent of the receipts from National  Forests are returned to the counties for roads and schools.  The increase in sales from the Forests will therefore help Â·  the tax situation but can hardly be expected at the start, Â·  if ever, to make up for the shortage entirely,  The only way counties may insure their prosperity  is through keeping private forest i ands productive. PrevenÂ­tion  of fires on cut-over lands will go far toward this result.  A reduction in the tax rate on standing timber, and co~ '  op(;~a Â·i:; ion en the part cf citizens to li;eep down the costs of  protection would do much t o e ncourage private owners to grow  new f orests.  The forest i?roblem is one of the mGst i mportant  problems the people cf north ;daho, the entire State in fact,  have to face. A supply of timber is essential to both aBri Â­cul  ture and mining, a nd the lumher i :!l;.;_st:r.y plays .a la:rge part  in the demand for products of the farm, dairy~ and r ange .

Hubert  Professor Â·of Forestry  School of Forestry, University of Idaho  It is not generally known that the native Idaho wood species com-pare  very favorably Nith coal in heating value, 1ut the following data  collected from various sources (see also references) indicate t~is to be  true.  The average heating value of dry ""TOOd is ,,bout 8,030 British therÂ­mal  units per pound, as compared to 12,040 per- pound for coal. In general,  two pounds of dry tâ€¢ood give off as much heat as one pound of good coal. One  co.,Â·d. of the heavier Yroods such as maple and :lic}::or~,, or two cords of cedar,  spruce, cot tonwooU., and o t~1er 1. igi1t ~""'ods ec:.ual in heat value one ton cf coal.  Douglas fir, ~estern larch, ~~d ponderosa pine, commonly known as  western ;â€¢ellorr or bull pine, ;Jre good fuel \700ds. The~r give off intense  heat but var~, in such qualities as ignition, unifor~ burning, a~d rapid  burning. The pine va..Â·ieties , suci1 as po11derosa, b'.1rn more ra!)idly but give  off a quicker, hotter fire. ~oods like Douglas fir and larch burn more  slowly but hold fire longer. Woods cont3i~ir.g resin or oil are proportion-ately  better. Dense pines containi~ 30 p~r cent resin, for example, have  a '-'elative fuel value considerably above that of 1.; c~:ory .  !,ioisture content, weight, amount of oils, a.11d resins and special  uses for '~ich heat is req'lired sbould all be carefull~v considered v-rhen  juclging fuel values of Ve.rious woods. The :lry '""ei2hts of various woods per  given volu;ne ?iYe c. good indicat ion of their ::.Â·elative values for fuel. ~qual  weie;hts of the same woods containing no oils or resins fÂ·ive off about the  sa:ne e:~I!'LO'..mt of heat "":""'hen burned. A !lundred po.:.n&lt;is of dry cottonwood s~1ould  - 2-  give as rruch heat as a hundred pounds of dr~ hickt â€¢.r. Heavy ryood will  average 4,000 pounQs per cord of 80 cubic feet; ~edium 3,000; light,  2, 000. Part of the aversion to the use of ,-Â·ooct as fuel is due to the fact  that the ~od is not pro~erly seasoned. Green wood, beside b8ing h?~der  to i{!!lite, is from 5 to 25 per cent less V-'llu.::tole for heating purposes th:ln  dry wood. Green 'vood is also he3.vier to :'l.:mdlo, for nec&gt;..rly a thous!3lld  pounds of moisture is lost from a cord of ~._Â·em: wood dmÂ·ing seasoning.

T;:e fuel value of wood is often rat ed lo""!er than it should be on  account of the :net:Â·.od used in burnir..g it . The stove or furnace, to give  the ~reatest head, should be kept filled with cloâ€¢rly packed wood and the  drafts carefully regu1.ated. B~r rewoving t~1e g ..Â· ate bars of a coal furnE:C e  and l~ing fire brick on the floo ..â€¢ of t:1e ash pit, and by tightly closing  the ash ~it door and opening the ventilator in the fuel door, wood can be  burned at a slow rate for heating puruoses. Special grates and a~plianceG  for burning brique~tes and other wood fuel in stoves and fire~laces are  now ave.ilable to the housekeeper.  There a~e !TlOre w'.l,YS than one in wl:ich local woods may be used as  fuel. In some regions charcoal is sold fo1Â· fuel purposes as well as for  technic~! use, and certain industrial pl~nts use ~ood g~s produced from  v&lt;aGte ,;ood. ""Green"" sa.1r,J.us t o!ld hogged fuel 3-re frequently m3.de use of in  - 3-  such gas producers at considerable savings. Because ~ood is cleaner, many  baking establishments continue to use wood in their bake ovens in preferÂ­ence  to other fuels.  In c~rtain regions where lumber mills and industrial plants are loÂ­cated,  huÂ·ge quantities of s:xtâ€¢!d.,~st, s~vings, and mill trimmings s.re UGed  successfully ~s :fuel for developing both heat and power. At Lewiston, Id3ho,  a highl~r efficient fuel briquette selling fo::- :t'oout 6 to 8 doll3l's par ton  is boing manufactured out of so.'Vdust and sh:o.vin . ..:s for use in 1'3.:-ge and small  furnaces, stove~. and f~. rerla.ces. This corrr_p:-essed fuel has two-t:1irds tile  heating value of harQ coal and in aldition it is clean and easy to handle.  There is little smo~:e, no clink~rs, and very little ash. The Forest Service  tells us t'!lat a cord of hardwood, for example, will produce only about 60  pounds of as~ ~hile a ton of hard coal will leave, after burning, from 200  to 300 peunds of ash.  In the :nore densely po~ulated regions where fore st wood may be scarce  a special type of wood briquette is m~e in ~11 ~1tities for automobile  tourist use.  The tourist or c~aper often searches for fuelTiood ~ith w~ich to cook  ~1is meals or to ~cee~ him ""'arm. Nine times out of t en he fails to select llis  fuel but gathers the nearest mat erial, w~:ic:1 is often lying o!: t!1e ground and  therefore likely to be ~et. ContrJry to 0eneral belief, a standing dead  tree, unless decayed, furnishes excellent fuel because it is dry; and a dry  stump often contains good kindling, wood.  I'or some purposes , such .J.s c""'mp fires a:-rl. '::&gt;onfires, it is always  :1elpful to know T&lt;Thich woods a:;.Â·e most likel'' to th:-u\'7 sparks; and for the  cooking fire, those ~oods whic~ buxn rapidly or those ~~ich produce the best  - 4 -  bed of coals. T:he following native species of v1ood are common to the  Idaho recreational reg i ons:  Sparl:-throwers: Box elder, :naple, red cedar, sl?ruce, hemlock,  balsam, and l~_rch. (several woods when \Vet will ""9opll a great deal.)  Kindling Woods: Pitchv pieces, drv pieces of ponderosa pine.  spruce, lodgenole pine, cedar, birc:1 bark, alder.  For coals: Aspen, mountain maple, cottonwood, dog~ood, mountain  ash, mountain ~~ogany, western vew, lar61, Douglas fir.  On a rainy day when a camp fire is t:!le one thing ~rou need most  and you want it quicily, it is well to know just what kind of tinder to  look for and w?-.ere. Dry cones of conifers; pitc!lY stunns; dry mosses ,  or lic~ens on the lower dead br~,c~es of livin6 trees; pine, fir or  cedar needles which are dry and r~ve turned red or brown; a~d the inner  bark of dry, standing dea~ trees are all useful as tinder for starting  vour fire .

Outbreaks of the Douglas- fir tussock moth sometimes develop  almost explosively but, after a year or two, may subside abruptl y. However,  some outbreaks have persisted at low levels for as long as 8 years. The  average life of an outbreak is 5 years.  The life history of the Douglas- fir tussock moth is inter esting because the  female is wingless. After mating in September, she l ays her eggs on the  cocoon from which she emerged. An egg mass usually has about 130 eggs but  may contain up to 250 eggs. The eggs ar~ bou_nd together in a frothy,  gelatinous substance with hairs from the female's body. After overwinter­ing  in the egg stage, the young caterpillars or larvae begin hatching in  May. These young larvae can be carried long distances by the wind  because they are very light and hairy. The caterpill ars start feeding  immediately and continue feeding until late August. Then they construct  hairy cocoons, enter a resting stage, and emerge as moths in September.  DAMAGE CAUSED  The Douglas- fir tussock moth kills trees quickly. Compl ete tree defoli­ation  may occur in a singl e season. In heavy infestation centers the  needles of all conifers present are destroyed. Defoliation by the tussock  moth not only retards tree growth but also kills trees.  In 1946 a severe epidemic of the Douglas- fir tussock moth broke out in  Benewah, Latah, and Clearwater Counties in northern Idaho . In some areas,  the tree mortality was almost 100 percent, while in other areas the 1947  spray program, virus, and parasites prevented severe losses.  THE CURRENT OUTBREAK  It is not known why tussock moth outbreaks occur. In 1964 extensive areas  were infested in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana.  The current tussock moth infestation was first detected in 1961 in and  near several towns in northern Idaho. These infestations were kept under  surveillance during 1962 and 1963. It was suspected that the outbreak  might decline before spreading into extensive forest stands. However,  intensive ground and aerial surveys in 1964 detected tussock moth egg  masses on 320,000 acres of forested lands in Benewah and Latah Counties.  The older infestations in Bonner, Boundary, and Kootenai Counties remained  static or appeared to be declining.  , . • BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION  The 1964 biological evaluation of the Benewah-Latah tussock moth infes­tation  indicates that heavy defoliation will occur in 1965 and that  extensive tree mortality and damage will result on about 130,000 acres.  Some polyhedrosis virus is present in parts of the infested area. To  obtain a better knowledge of the amount of virus present, egg masses  were collected and reared in the Forestry Sciences Laboratory at  Corvallis, Oregon. Virus was present in several areas south of the  Palouse River, but is not considered in sufficient amounts to control  the infestation this year.  STAND VALUES  The infested stands represent some of the most productive and accessible  forest lands in Idaho. The annual yield per acre ranges between 200 and  250 board feet. The current stumpage value is about $5 per thousand. The  growth loss alone after 2 years' defoliation would more than pay for the  cost of the project. In addition to growth loss, heavy tree mortality  will occur in patches throughout the 130,000 acres of moderate to heavy  infestation. The currently thriving Christmas tree industry will be  lost for several years if no control action is taken. It is estimated  that the total dollar loss per acre would average between $15 and $20 if no  control action is taken. This means that the total stand loss would be 15  to 20 times the cost of control. In addition, there would be a considerable  loss in esthetic values plus the high forest fire hazard potential created  by the dead trees.  OTHER VALUES  Within the spray area the fishing streams and reservoirs will be given  special treatment. The tussock moth infested area is, for the most part,  well stocked with elk, deer, and upland game birds.  Project plans call for an intensive monitoring program by all related  State and Federal agencies. Prespray and postcontrol samples of fish  and wildlife populations will be taken by trained biologists. Some  residue analyses will be obtained from sensitive areas.  CONTROL METHODS  Most entomologists believe that 1965 control efforts should be concentrated  on the 130,000 acres of moderate to heavy infestation where tree mortality  will occur in 1965.  The only proven control method for the tussock moth is the aerial appli­cation  of DDT at the rate of three-fourths pound in 1 gallon of fuel oil  per acre. This spray will be applied by both fixed-wing planes and  helicopters.  -2-  Control through the ae~ application of a polyhedrosi~irus has good  potential, but has not been fully perfected and tested. Enough polyhedrosis  virus is available to use on an operational pilot test . The Troy watershed  will be sprayed with virus.  Treatment with virus may control the tussock moth, but the degree of defoli­ation  that wil l occur during the period of control is not known.  FOLLOWUP ACTION  I t will be necessary to keep all Douglas-fir tussock moth infestations in  the Northern Region under close surveillance during 1965 in order to  determine what control action may be required in 1966.

W-6-64-13  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Idaho Forest Industries Committee  ID:runett, Idaho )  TREES  make  NEWS IDAHO TOWN BECOMES AIR BASE FOR GRIM WAR  AGAINST FOREST EPIDEMIC OF SPRUCE BUDWORM l  SALMON, IDAHO (Special) - This little community, lying in the shadow of the  Bitterroot Range in east-central Idaho, is destined within the next few weeks to  become an air base for a grim war against one of man's most destructive forest  enemies--the spruce budworm.  Fly westward from here along the jagged course of the mountains and a  panorama of timbered ridges sprawls in all directions beneath your wings. This  is Salmon National Forest, part of the great green resource that makes Idaho  possessor of the fifth largest sawtimber reserve of any state in the nation.  But this is a forest in trouble. Since 1958, an infestation of the spruce  budworm, one of the great forest killers of the West, has stealthily extended  S\vaths of death and defoliation over this cathedral-quiet domain. By 1960, over  236,000 acres were infested. By 1961, some 964,000 acres showed damage. By the  fall of 1962, the epidemic had grown to 1,600,000 acres on both the Salmon and  the adjacent Challis and Payette national forests.  In 1963, the U.S. Forest Service applied chemicals to a 16,500-acre test area  of the Salmon to make certain that techniques for aerial application of DDT were  truly safe. It also conducted spray operations on 200,000 acres of the nearby  Targhee National Forest.  The really big push against the spruce budworm is planned for this summer.  Control operations on 500,000 acres of the most heavily hit sections of budworm  infestation on the Salmon are scheduled to get undenvay on or about June 25. At  stake are over 600 million board feet of threatened timber, wildlife populations  to whom this forest is home, valuable watersheds and bountiful recreation values.  (more)  . ,c--  IDAHO TO.-lN BECOMES AIR BASE - 2  A survey this week of f orestry authorities knowledgeable on Intermountain  Region forests produced a consensus Qf opi~ion that the budworm threatens a  greatly expanded area of timber destruction next year if it isn't stopped now.  Ernest Wohletz, dean of the School of Forestry at the University of Idaho,  MOscow, said the outbreak poses a major threat to Idaho's forest resource.  ""Chemical spraying is the only major tool of practical value which foresters  presently have available for use against insect epidemics,"" Wohletz said. ''We are  working to develop biological and cultural controls, genetically superior trees,  radiation treatment of insects and other methods, but these solutions are still in  experimental stages.""  E. M. Stoddard of Mountain Home, chairman of the conservation committee of  Western Wood Products Association, a forest industry group, said use of chemical  sprays on forest pests in carefully planned and coordinated programs has been  proven safe and effective.  ""Millions of acres have been sprayed in the West Hithout harm to wildlife,""  he observed. ""No other chemical has been so thoroughly tested in practical use  and none approaches it in effectiveness. We are supporting this control program  as necessary to protect Idaho's forest resource.""  Clifford T. Solberg, Forest Service project leader for the control program,  said many special precautions are being taken to protect wildlife.  Solberg said wildlife biologists from the Idaho Fish and Game Commission are  cooperating closely in the project. An extensive communications network of  ground-to-air and air-to-air communications is being set up, he said, to assure  tight control of application.  ""This is going to be one of the most carefully planned and executed spray  programs ever undertaken,"" Solberg declared.  (more)  IDAHO TOWN BECOMES AIR BASE - 3  Ernest L. Kolbe, chief forester for W#PA, said the budworm is one of the  West's most destructive pests.  ""If the Salmon forest outbreak were left to spread unchecked,"" he said,  ""it will have a substantial impact on Idaho's $50,000,000 annual forest industry  payroll.""  Deputy State Forester Jack Gillette said a chemical control program such as  the one on the Salmon becomes necessary as a last resort when it is clearly  evident that natural controls will not do the job. Foresters on the Salmon, he  said, are in much the same position as the home gardener who finally reaches for  an insect sprayer when he sees his prized plants being chewed up.  ""Actually, however, an acre of forest land receives less chemical spray in  the lifetime of an average tree than does an average home garden in a single  season,"" said Gillette. ttForests are rarely sprayed, and then at low dosages.  Most of Idaho's forest land has never received any chemical treatment.""  Gillette said the project has been studied and approved by the Federal Pest  Control Review Board, a body made up of representatives from the departments  Interior, Agriculture, Defense and Health, Education and Welfare.  30  Ida. 25a, 26 & spec. 27",,,,2015-08-25,2015-08-25,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/109,109,164.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/164.pdf,forestryresearch109

Objective of study  To evaluate the immediate effects on aquatic organisms of a DDT spray program  where a 100 feet non-spray strip is left on each side of Hughes Creek and its  tributaries. The next 400 feet from the stream is sprayed by a helicopter at  a rate of one-halt pound DDT per acre, and the rest of the infested area by  fixed-wing aircraft at the rate of 1 pound DDT per acre.  II. Assignment of Personnel  This study will be directed and supervised by the Idaho Fish & Game Depart­ment's  Area Biologist who is directly responsible to the Department's Chief  of Fisheries Management. Personnel to assist the Area Biologist will consist  of four departmental fisheries biologists and one biological aid.  A Cooperative Agreement between the Forest Service and the Idaho Fish and Game  Department provides that specific portions of the aquatic monitoring program  are being assigned to the Department. Specitica.lly, the Department will be  directly responsible for planning and conducting the Hughes Creek monitbring  program. Monitoring the remainder of the spray project is the responsibility  of the Forest Service as provided in a separate study plan.  During, spray operations, it is mutually agreed that as peak workload periods  of aquatic monitoring shift from one phase to the other, there will need to  be a corresponding shift in manpower and personnel from each agency to work  on the other phase than the one for Which their individual agency is responsible.  It will be the responsibility of the Department's Area Fisheries Biologist and  the Project Fisheries Biologist to coordinate exchange of personnel in field  assignments. All personnel will remain administratively responsible to the  agency by which they are empioyed but will be directed to follow instructions  of the fisheries biologist in charge of the particular field job to which they  may be assigned.  The Pesticide Chemicals Research Branch of the Agricultural Research Service  in Yakima, Washington, will cooperate in this study program as consultant to  the project design and operation and will analyze water and fish samples to  determine pesticide residues.  III. Timing  Timing of the aquatic monitoring program is dependent on spruce budwonn develop­ment.  However, pre spray sampling w:l.ll begin approx:iJDately one week before  sprq.l.ng start;s and w:l.ll terminate approxlmat~ ~tober 15, 1964.  IV. Methods .  A. Selection of Test stations  A total of five test stations will be located on Hughes Creek and its tribut­aries.  The location ot each station is shown on the attached map.  0  ~~ control stations will be used for this study. The location of these  stations are to be determined later. These controls will be the same as  used by the Forest Service as control stations.  B. Aquatic Insect Drift Sampling.  2.  Insect drift sampling will be conducted at each test station. However, only  limited_ sampling will.._be done at the control stations. Each prespray sam-p'""'""l:::....e--­will  consist of a 15 minute sampling period at hourly intervals. Prior to  spraying, sampling with alwninum screen and surber drift nets will be done  for one 24 hour period (includes night time sampling), to measure the normal  pre-sprar number or insects drifting in the stream. Twenty four hour sampling  is expected to give an .indication or aquatic insect population densities.  On spray days at each test station, one 15 minute drift sample will be taken  each hour starting one hour before sprar time and continuing for 8 hours.  These samples will be taken with aluminum screen drift nets, the mesh measure­ment  of which are 144 openings per square inch. In addition, a series of  corresponding samples will be taken at test stations T-1 and T-5 with fine  meshed surber drift nets, to determine the number of very small insects drift­ing  in the stream • .  Insects collected ·in drift nets will be put in vials, labeled for identific­ation,  and preserved in alcohol. Taxinomic tabulations will be completed by  approximately August 31, 1964.  C. Bottom Sampling of Insects  Bottom insects will be sampled at test stations T-1, T-2, and T-5 and at the  control stations one week prior to spray, two weeks after spraying, one month  after spraying, and three months after spr¢ng. A total of twenty square  feet will be sampled at each of the above stations on each sampling date.  Bottom sampling apparatus will consist or a circular frame with a sampling  area of two square feet. Insects collected from bottom samples will be placed  in bottles -containing alcohol and labeled. A quantitative taxanomical analysis  of bottom samples will be made. Identification work will be done by Idaho  , Fish and Game Department and Forest Service personnel.  D. Live Box Tests  At each test and control station three live boxes will be placed in the stream.  ' \ Approximately three .days before spraying begins, 120 steelhead fry 1 120 hatchery­''  ·~~ reared rainbow fingerlings, and approximately 75 Chirmok salmon· fingerlings  . ~\ will be placed in separate live boxes at each station. The day before spraying  \&gt;J is to conmence, all but 100 steelhead and rainbow, and 50 chinook salmon will  be removed from each boz •  .. '  Fish will be kept in live boxes approximately one week after spraying is  completed and mortality, if it occurs, will be not ed each day.  Control stations will be located in two streams well outsi de or the spray  area. These stations will be the same as those used tor the general moni­toring  program. Separate sets or live box tests will be used £or ~ach phase  or the project.  Test fish will be obtained as follows:  1. Chinook salmon will be collected from traps on the North Fork or the  Salmon River, the Lemhi River, the Salmon River, t he Pahs:iJneroi River,  and the East Fork Salmon River. In addition and it necessary, Salmon  fingerlings will be obtained by electric shockers from the Lemhi River .•  2. Steelhead trout fey will be trapped from a.n artificial spawning  channel located on the Lemhi River.  3· Rainbow trout will be transported from t he Mackay Fish Hatchery.  Live boxes will be placed in slow moving water when possible. Test fish  will be protected tram swim fatigue by boarding solid one or more sides of  each box. Portions of the bottom of each box may also be boarded solid for  additional protection.  E. Analysis of Fish for DDT  Twenty fish of each species fro~ the various .lots of test and control fish  •dll be sacked in plastic bags, labeled, and frozen prior to the t:iJne spraying  begins. All fish, it any, which die during the spray and post-spray periods,  will be removed from the live boxes. These fish will also be sacked in  plastic bags, labeled and frozen. Similarly, 20 surviving fish from each  test control live box will be preserved by freezing at the end ot the testing  period.  Lots of fish to be analyzed for DDT will be determined after data on fish  mortality, it any, has been examined.  F. l'later Sample Analyses  One pint (16 oz.) water samples wlll be collected every 15 minutes from 0400 to  t. ) 1200 each day spraying occurs. Samples will be collected from each of two test  stations. No samples will be collected from the control stations. Samples will  be collected in 16 oz. screw:-cap tins. They will be-shippedtothe following  laboratory for analysis: Analytical Investigations, Pesticide Chemicals Research  Branch, Agricultural Research Service, J706 Nob Hill Boulevard, Yakima, Washington,  98902, c/o Kenneth Walker.  For anwses the entire sample will be used, including a solvent rinse of  the can after pouring out the water. Findings will be reported in parts  per billion or DDT and its metabolites and of any other identifiable pesti­cide  residue.  Identification numbers will be scratched on the sides of each can, as well  As on each lid. Other pertinent data will be recorded on appropri~te field  forms.  G. Spray Card Analyses  The spray distribution pattern lilil be analyzed by placing oil-sensitive  cards in various locations. The approximate locati on of eight spray card  transects is shOtm on the attached map. Spray cards will be spaced one  chain apart extending 20 chains up the slope from each stream bank. However,  the first chain distance from the stream bank will have cards distributed  approximately ten feet apart. Spr~ cards will be replaced each d~ that  spraying occurs within the Hughes Creek drainage.  The distribution and collection of transect cards will be done by Forest  Service personnel.  Additional spray cards will be placed immediately adjacent to the stream  banks on Hughes Creek and its tributaries by Fish and Game Department personnel.  V. Reports  The Idaho Fish and Game Department is responsible for reporting this phase  of the monitoring project. A preliminary report of findings to date will  be submitted to the Forest Service through the l.fonitor Coordinator, target  date for this report will be November 1, 1964. A final report will be due  within 90 days after completion of field work. Any field data related to  this study that is requested by Forest Service shall be forwarded to the  Regional Forester, Ogden, Utah. Copies or these same data may be retained  by the Department for their files.  -  \~----~~~==~======~~~====--~- ~==-=--~--==-~==================  ~- ' AYt·.a.  /  /  /  j  I.  ••  -  ,. .., .I""'  I 'lo I I •  ' ..' \ ::  ...  ...  /  ...

Assignment of Personnel  This study will be directed and supervised by the Project Fisheries  Biologist who is directly responsible to the Monitor Coordinator.  Personnel to assist the Fisheries Biologist will consist of two Forest  Service wildlife biologists detailed from other Forests, and four  wage board employees assigned to the project. The Regional Fisheries ·  Biologist will assist the Pro j ect Fisheries Biologist in an advisory  capacity.  A Cooperative Agreement between the Forest Service and the Idaho Fish  and Game Department provides that the Department will be assigned to  specific portions of the aquatic monitoring program.  The Idaho Fish & Game Department will be specifically responsible for  planning and conducting aquatic monitoring of Hughes Creek. There is·  a separate approved study plan for that phase. Monitoring the remainder  of the spray project is the responsibility of the Forest Service as set  forth in this study plan. It is mutually aereed that during spray operations  as peak workload periods of aquatic monitoring shift from one phase to the  other there will need to be a corresponding shift in manpower so that  personnel from each agency may be ~equired on the other phase  than t he one for which their individual agency is responsible.  It will be the responsibility of the Department's Area Fisheries Biologist  and the Project Fisheries Biologist to coordinate exchange of personnel  in field assignments. All persor~el will remain administratively  responsible to the agency by whi ch they are employed but will be directed  to follow instructions of the fisheries biologist in charge of the particular  field job to which they may be assigned.  The Pesticide Chemicals Research Br~ch of the Agric~ltural Research Service,  Yakima, Washington, will cooperate in this study program as consultant to  the project design and operation and will analyze water and fish samples  to determine pesticide residues.  III. Timing  Timing of the aquatic monitoring program is dependent on spruce budworm  development. However, prespray sampling will begin three to four days  before spraying starts and will terminate approximately October 15, 1964.  IV. Methods  A. Bottom Sampling  Aquatic insect populations are measurable by various methods of  bottom sampling. For the purpose of this study, bottom samples  will be taken as follows:  1. Areas for sampling will be selected on the basis of uniformity  of water depth, s i ze of bottom materials, and stream velocity~  2. Ten square feet will be sampled at each station two days before  spraying, again as soon after spraying as possible and again  approximately October 15, 1964.  3· A sampling station will be located at each of the following  locations (field conditions may make it necessary to modify these  somewhat):  a. The main channel of Salmon River near the lower end of the  project area.  b. On the lower end of Panther Creek.  c. On t he lower end of NoFth Fork of Salmon River.  d. On the lower end of Moose Creek or Pierce Creek.  e. On the lower end of Opal Creek or Cabin Creek.  f . Two control s t r eams well outside of the Project area.  ar e yet to be selected.  These  2  Bot tom sampling appara~us will consist of a circular frame with a  sampling area of two square feet. Insects collected in bottom samples  will be preserved in alcohol ana placed in plastfc bottles and labeled.  A quantitative taxanomical a nalysi s of bot tom samples will be made.  Identification work will be done by Idaho Fish and Game Department  and project fisheries biologists.  Each bottom sample will be placed in an individual glass vial.  Identification labels of white paper, with writing in pencil, will be  put inside each vial.  .  .,j  October samples will be collected by Forest. Service personnel  assisted by Idaho Fish & Game Department personnel.  B. Aquatic Insect Drift Sampling  Drift samples of insects will be taken for a one-day period either  one or two days before spraying and daily during spraying. Hourly,  drift samples will be taken for five-minute .. periods from 0400  through 1600 o'clock.  1. Drift sample stations will be located:  a. On the lower end of Pierce or Moose Creeks.  b. On the lower end of Sheep Creek if time permits.  3  c. On the lower end of Big Sheepeater or Little Sheepeater Creeks.  d. On the lower end of Opal or Cabin Creeks.  e. On the lower end of Deep Creek if time permits.  f. Two in the control streams which will be selected for other  phases of this program.  2. The location of drift sampling stations in regard to stream  channel will take into consideration:  a . Uniformity of depth.  b. Uniformity of velocitj.  c. Uniforr.tity of main now current.  Sampling apparatus for collecting drift samples will consist of a bag  type sampler made with aluminum screen with mesh of 144 openings per square  inch. The mouth or opening of the sampler will be one square foot in area.  Samples collectea will be preserved in alcohol and placed in plastic  bottles. Each bottle will be labelea. Labels will be of whi te paper  with writing in pencil. •  c. Live Box Testing  Live box tests will be done to measure the effects of DDT on fish  during spraying operations. Live box testing stations will be located  near the mouths of Panther Creek, the North Fork of the Salmon River,  Moose Creek or Pierce Creek, and Opal Creek or Cabin Creek. In .  addition a station will be located near the bottom sampling station  on the main Salmon River at the lower end of the project area. Three  species (steelhead, chinook salmon, and rainbow trout) will be  placed in each set of boxes, each species in a separate box.  Control stations will be placed in two streams well outside the  spray project area. These will be the same control stations as  those used for the Hughes Creek monitoring program.  Wild chinook salmon fingerlings will be collected in live traps  in the Lemhi River and held in raceways until just before project  spraying starts. They will then be moved to holding boxes on  the control streams and held until needed for the testing stations.  Steelhead a.nd rainbow fingerlings will be obtained by the Game  Department from one of their hatcheries and put in holdings boxes  in the control stream until needed for the testing stations.  Three sides and one-half the bottom will be boarded solid to  reduce physical stream impact on fish. Each box will be placed in a  slow moving pool within the stream with the open side of the box  down stream.  A total of 200 fish, if available, will be placed in each box two  to four days prior to spraying in the drainages of the test stations.  On the morning that spraying is to commence, all but 110 live,  vigorous fish will be removed and discarded. Ten of those remaining  will b~ randomly selected, sacked, labeled, and put in the freezer.  Each live box will be checked every day for a minimum of seven  days after spraying begins in the test drainage. Live fish from  each box will be counted and the dead ones removed, sacked, labeled,  and put in the freezer. Ten fish will be randomly selected from  those remaining alive at the end of testing period in each live  box, sacked, labeled, and put in freezer. The remaining live fish  will be sacked according to individual live boxes and frozen.  D. Analysis of Fish  Upon compilation of records those live boxes, if any, having a  significant mortality of fish following spraying will be noted.  Those batches of fish taken from each such box will be analyzed  for pesticide residues. This will mean three batches for each  box: (1) pre-spray removals; (2) spray and post-epray mortality  if it occurs; and (3) post-spray survivals.  Survival results will be analyzed for each live box of fish from  the treatment areas and compared for significant differences from  survival in the controls. If significant differences do occur  4  samples of fish taken from those boxes and .from those controls used  for controls will be analyzed for residue levels.  E. Wild Fish  5  Using ""the electric shocker, pre-spray samples of wild fish will be  collected from five stations within the spray areaG and three control  stations. Samples will be segregated as to species--chinook or trout  (impossible to distinguish trout from steelhead which have not gone to  the ocean). The same areas will be sampled from two to four weeks  after spraying and again about the middle of October 1964. All  collections will be identified, packaged, and frozen. These will be  held for possible residue analyses. Determination as to whether  analysis will or will not be made will be dependent on the needs for  additional information in connection with other aquatic monitoring  findings.  Any other dead fish picked up within the spray project will be collected,  identified, packaged, and frozen. If determined later that a residue  level of dead wild fish would be desirable, analysis will be made.  F. Water ~mpling  One-pint water samples will be taken to determine the amount of DDT  coming down the streams. Water samples will be collected in con­junction  with insect drift sampling on Big or Little Sheepeater  Creeks, Pierce or Moose Creeks, Opal or Cabin Creeks, and both Deep  and Sheep Creeks, if time permits. Pre-spray water samples will  be taken for one day immediately preceding spraying at oltOO, oBoo,  1200, and 1600 hours. On spray days samples will be collected hourly  from 0400 through 1600. ..  Fluorescein dye will be used experimentally to trace and time the  flow of water in some streams. This will be done to assist in the  timing for water sample collections.  Samples vill be collected i n 16-oz. screw-cap tins. They will be  shipped to the following laboratory for analyses:  Analytical Investigations  Pest icide Chemica~s Research Branch  Agricult ural Research Servic!  3706 Nob Hiil Boulevard  Yakima, Washington 98902  c/o. Kenneth Walker  For analyses the entire sample will be used, including a solvent rinse  of the can after pouring out the water. Findings vill be reported in  parts per billion of DDT and its metabolites and of &n1 other identi-fiable  pesticide residue. ·  1 . •  v.  For those periods of water sampling which mdght seem extra critical  in identifying .residues duplicate samples will be taken for use in  case anything happens to the original.  Identification numbers and other necessary information will be  scratched on the sides of the sample cans.  G. Aquatic Vegetation  Samples of the following vegetation will be taken before spraying and  again in mid-October:  Emergent - watercress from mouth of Wagonhammer Creek.  Submergent - filamentous algae from one undetermined source.  These samples will be frozen and held for later analyses if deemed  necessary to have the information.  H. Spray Card Analysis  6  A pattern of oil sensitive spray card use is being developed by the  Project Ground Operations Officer for the purpose of monitoring spray  distribution within the project. The Project Fisheries Biologist will  coordinate his spray distribution monitoring program with Ground  Operations to make all possible use of that information. Where the  Ground Operations spray card pattern will not monitor the streams,  especially upstream from the aquatic monitoring s t ations, sufficiently  to identify stream-side spray distribution the aquati c monitoring  personnel will set out card lines. These will be lccated in selected  areas. Some will be parallel.and immediately adjacent to stream banks  and others will be perpendicular to the stream, extending throug~ the  protective nonspray zone and the one-half pound application zone.  Monitoring for Project Control Specifications  During the firs~ three days of spray application, close and intensive  aquatic monitoring will be carried on to determine, so far as possible,  the effectiveness of protective controls being applied.  Techniques used will be those for the regular monitoring proeram which  will provide daily information on the immediate impatt. Specifically  these are:  A. Aquatic insect drift sampling immediately before and during  spraying at both test and control stations.  B. Additional spray card lines, some lines perpendicular to the  streams and other parallel and adjacent to stream edges.  c. All other field conditions having any bearing on spraying as it  might affect the streams will be observed.  J  . .. .  7  Following each day of intensive monitoring, findings of that .day will be  reported. This will include the results of A, B, & C listed above from  both the treatment and the control areas. Advise and counsel from the  on-the-ground Idaho Fish & Game Department biologists will be sought and  considered with Forest Service biologists recommendations of the spray  operations. The Monitor Coordinator will make an evaluation of all  information and will make daily recommendations to the Project Leader.  Based on this 'evaluation and the recommendations the decision will be  made by the Project Leader whether to increase or decrease the average  non-spray width along the selected streams or to continue at the established  width.  Throughout the project period following these first three days of intensive  monitoring, findings of the regular monitoring program described in this  study plan will be interpretated each day. If apparent adverse effects on  streams appear at any time the situation will be reported immediately to  the Monitor Coordinator. He will evaluate the information, consult with  the Fish & Game Department, then make recommendations as needed to the  Project Leader.  VI. Reports  Any recommendations made during project operations for adjustments in  control specifications will be documented by the individual making them  and transmitted through or by the Monitor Coordinator to the Project  Leader.  The Project Fisheries Biologist will maintain files of all field data  results and laboratory analyses of samples collected under this study  program. A final report will be written by the Project Fisheries  Biologist, and submitted to the Mpnitor Coordinator. Target date for  this report will be November 1, 1964. Final report will be submitted  by the Monitor Coordinator to the Project Leader by November 15, 1964.  •  .  .i",,,,2015-08-25,2015-08-25,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/111,111,166.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/166.pdf,forestryresearch111

Outbreaks of the Douglas-fir tu sock moth sometime develop  almoct explosively but, atter a year or tvo1 r:ay subside abruptly. However,  some outb ks have persisted at lov levels for a long as 8 years. The  ave~ life of an outb ak 1 5 years.  DAMAGE CAUSED  The Do11gl.as·fir tussock moth is a quick killer of trees. Complete tree  defoliation may occur in a single season. In heavy infestation centers the  needles of all conifers present are destroyed. Defoliation by the tussock  moth not only retards tree growth but also kills trees. In 1956, on the  Stanislaus National Forest in California, 6o percent of the \.Yhite fir trees  that wre defoliated ( 90 percent by the tussock moth) failed to recover.  Many other trees vere so seriously damaged that the tops died or tbe t  were killed by attacks of other insects and fungi. Mature grand fir t  are killed more quickly tban younger ae;e claa a. Serious forest fire  har.arda develop in all heavily damaged stands.  THE OUTBRFAKB  It is not lmown vb.y tussock moth outbreaks occur. In 1964, extensive area.a  vere infested in California, Oregon, WashiDgton, Idaho, and Montana.  The eu~nt Idaho tusaock moth infestation was first detected 1n 1961 1n and  near several towns in northern Idaho. These infestations were kept under  surveillance durine 19Ee and 1963. It vas suo cted that the outbreak might  decline before spreading into extensive forest stands. Ho-.rever, intensive  ground and aerial survey in 1964 detected tussock moth egg masses on 320,000  acres of forested lands in Benewe.h and latah Counties, while the infestations  in Bonner 1 Boundary 1 and Kootenai Counties remained static or appeared to b  declintng.  or the 320,000 cres of 1D atec1 stands, 115,000 cres on the outer fringe  ot the oatb supported only oc 1onal ss a Vitb no detectable  detoUE.tton.

This inforn:ation vill be available in early Mareb 1965.  CONTROL 1-lm'HODS  The onl:y proven control method for the tussock moth is the aerial applica-­tion  of' DDT at the rate of 1 pound per acre in 1 gallon of fuel oil. The  cost p~r acre for this type of control is approximately $1, which would  break a.o wn as follows :  DDr insecticide formulated  Aerial. application (flying)  Observation planes  Overhead--administration  Total  -2-  $0.36 per acre or gallon  .35 per acre  .05 per acre  .24 per acre  $1.00 per acre  ppllcation of a po Virus good  1\ll.ly rtected and ated.

The CUl""l'mlt stumpage value is about $5 per thousand. The  grovtb los alone after 2 rs • defoliation would more than pay for the  coat of"" t proj ct.

It is estimated that the total  dollar loss per acre vould average betveen $15 and $2o if no control action  is taken. This m s t the total stand lo s would be 15 to 20 times the  cost of' control. In addition to this there would be a considerable loss in  estb.etj c values plus the high forest fire hazard potential created by the  dead ttees.  OTIIER VAlDES  Within the spray area tb re are only a tew fishing streams and these are of  poor q\l.ality. Rovever., the tu sock moth 1nte ted area is, for the most  part, veU stocked vith lk, deer, and upland same birds.  The Troy municipal va.tershed and possibly other watersheds, plus 11 cr1 tical  or sensitive areas, would need to be treated with virus.  FINANCES  The project would be financed as follows:  1. The Forest Service would pay the total cost of oprayine; Federal  lands Ilus one-third of the eoat of spraying aU State and private lands;  total Forest Service cost--$100,000.  2. The State of Idaho vill pay for two-thirds ot the treatment cost  on all State lands plus one-lw.lf of the cost to private landovnars; to·cal  State cf Iaaho cost--$6o,ooo.

The 1964 program has been studied and approved by the Federal Pest Control  Review Board which was organized in 1961. This board is composed of two  members each from the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Defense,  and Health, Education and Welfare. It recommends approval or rejection  of any and all Federally-proposed pesticide control programs .  Before approving a program, the Board thoroughly studies each proposal  from the standpoint of problems arising from pesticide use which pose  ha~ards to human health, livestock, crops, fish, wildlife and to the  economic well-being of business, industry, agriculture and t he public .  The Forest Service, which has observed the Salmon National Forest infesta~  tion for four years and has deferred action in the hope that natural disease  or parasites would halt the epidemic, reports that this has failed to  develop and it is now forced to spr~ to save the trees in the area.  Preliminary to the 1964 program, a 16,000-acre demonstration of procedures  2  and techniques to be followed on the 500,000-acre project was successfully  performed in 1963. This was monitored by fish and game conservationists  and many others.  Insect and other forest pests annually destroy more timber than fire, damage  wildlife habitat, and frequently leave vast areas of ghost forest. Dead  snags which create dangerous forest fire conditions put a bligat on the  beauty of the landscape and could retard the Forest Service's timber grow­ing  timetable by a hundred years or more in the affected area.  During the past decade, Forest Service aerial spraying has successfully  controlled insect epidemics on 16,000,000 acres of forest and park lands  in America.  With full awareness of the national concern over pesticide use, the Forest  Service has drawn on its 15 years of experience in aerial spraying to  produce this year its most thoroughly planned and carefully screened  control program.  The Forest Service consults regularly with Federal and State fish and wild­life  services and with State and Federal public health agencies before  applying pesticides.  To combat epidemics of tree defoliators, such as the spruce budworm,  insecticides applied by low-flying aircraft are the only presently  available weapons which can effectively do the job. As added protection for  fish in aerial spray areas, the normal dosage of one pound of DDT per  acre will be cut to 1/2 pound near lakes and streams. Within 100 feet  or more, depending on the slope, no spraying will be done.  Forest Service research scientists are searching for new non-persistent  chemicals as well as non-chemical methods for combating forest insects  and diseases. A new pesticide laboratory at Berkeley, California, is  giving full attention to accelerating progress in this field.  3  As part of this research effort, the Forest Service plans to conduct a  pilot test this year to determine effectiveness of one of the newer  insecticides called Dimethoate against the spruce budworm. A heavily­infested  area of about 2,000 acres on the Salmon National Forest has been  selected for the study. This non-persistent chemical will be s~rayed by  helicopter. Four ounces of the insecticide in one gallon of fuel oil will  be applied at the rate of one gallon per acre. This important test is  another attempt by the Forest Service to find an acceptable substitute  for DDT, the most effective pesticide to knock out a spruce budworm  epidemic with a single application. Scientists have determined that 95  percent or more of the insect population must be killed in the operation  to be successful.  This is in line with a major effort by the u. s. Departments of Agriculture  and Interior to find an effective non-persistent substitute for DDT. In  western Montana the two Departments are conducting, this year, the firs~  large-scale experimental use of Malathion. It is the hope of forestry  officials that from the various tests being' run this year, an effective  non-persistent forest insecticide will be found. (Details of the pre­cautions  being followed on the Salmon National Forest DDT spray project  are attached.)  The following precautions will be exercised in applying insecticides on  all forest pest· control projects in 1964:  1. A non-spray strip varying in width from 100 feet to one-quarter mile  depending on slope to the stream and forest cover will be left along  main streams, lakes, and other sensitive areas.  2. The dosage rate of DDT will not exceed l/2# per acre along another  strip up to about 400 feet adjoining the spray-free zones. The  remainder of the area will receive treatment at the rate of one  pound per acre.  3· Helicopters will be used for applying insecticides in most sensitive  areas.  4. To the extent possible, spray blocks will be laid out in a manner to  minimize spray drift into water, and other non-forested areas, and  spraying timed to catch air currents moving away from and not into  sensitive areas.  5· Spraying will be restricted to times when wind velocity is less than  six miles per hour and temperatures below 68 degrees. These are  usually the early morning hours following daybreak.  6. Aerial observers will be on constant duty during spraying operations  to see that pilots are applying insecticides as instructed. The  observers are empowered to ground a pilot for infractions of rules  and to suspend operations when the spray pattern begins to break up.  7. Spraying aircraft will be accurately calibrated to discharge pre­scribed  amounts of pesticides and checked frequently to assure that  the application rate is correct.  8. Aircraft will be rigidly checked to see that plane and spraying equip­ment  are in good mechanical condition.  . )  2  9· Spray pilots will be carefully briefed to avoid to the extent possible  flying over lakes, pastures and residential areas, or parallel to  streams. They will also be instructed to avoid overlaps and skip~ in  making spray runs and to turn around on ridge tops rather than stream  bottoms.  10. When fill-in spraying is needed, care will be taken to avoid retreat­ing  an area adequately covered initially.  11. To minimize drift spray planes will fly as close to tree-top level as  safety requirements permit.  12 . Major spraying proJects will be monitored and evaluated from the stand­point  of effects of spraying on the environment.",,,,2015-08-25,2015-08-25,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/116,116,170.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/170.pdf,forestryresearch116

Late in 1963, surveys by Forest Service ento­mologists  indicated that t he epidemic could be  expected to continue. Natural enemies of the  budworm have not checked the epidemic or pre­vented  further damage, and t he infestation has  extended over 1,500,000 acres on t he Salmon  and other nearby National Forests. In an effort  to curtail this severe loss to Idaho, the U. S.  Forest Service, Intermountain Region, is plan­ning  control on approximately 500,000 acres  this summer.  THE SPRUCE BUDWORM:  Prior to t he current critical infestation against  which control efforts began in 1963, the last  serious outbreaks requiring control were on the  Boise, Payette, Challis, Salmon, and Targhee  National Forests in 1955, '56, and '57. T his par­ticular  epidemic was suppressed over the t hree­year  period.  Spruce budworm is potent ially one of t he most  destructive enemies of Douglas-fir and t rue firs  in North America. Principal damage results from  t he caterpillars feeding on new foliage. Deforma­tion,  reduced growth, or death to th~ trees is the  result of sustained, uncontrolled attacks of the  pests. T he insect attacks trees of all ages indis­criminately  but is particularly damaging to sap­lings  and young stands. T he older trees some­times  survive but with reduced growth rates.  WHY THIS MUST BE DOl'..) .. NOW  Timber values critical to local communities and  state economy must be maintained. The forests  of tomorrow must be protected.  The a llowable timber harvest from management  units (working circles) may be reduced by insect  damage.  A costly crash salvage program yielding poorer  quality logs can result from the infestation.  Insect-killed forests increase the overall forest  fire hazard.  Forest aesthetics, wildlife habitat, and controlled  usable waterflow will be lost to Idahoans and  the visiting American public.  FACTS ABOUT THE SPRAY OPERATION  OBJECTIVES:  I. To reduce the infestations to the lowest  possible level consistent with public safety,  protection of fish and wildlife resources,  good multiple use management, and economy.  II. To keep the public informed regarding  planning, operation, and completion of the  project.  Ill. Work closely with cooperators, interested  individuals, and organizations.  DURATION:  On suitable flying days from late June to late  July, aerial application of DDT spray on the in­fested  timber will be done from 4:00a.m. to about  10:00 a.m. Estimated time for completion of the  project is 20 days. Future control work will be  based on the insect population status and on  new, approved control procedures.  SAFETY AND SPRAYING:  The most severely infested timberlands will be  sprayed in 1964. Spraying will be accomplished  with both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters for  tight control. Fixed-wing aircraft will fly from  t he Salmon and Challis airports, while helicop­ters  will operate from selected bases on the  Salmon National Forest.  Salmon-spawning streams, trout streams and  lakes, and water impoundments have received  special protective considerations by State Fish  and Game biv .)ists and by Forest Rangers. A  spray technique developed through last year's  special test on the Salmon National Forest will  be used. This test showed that aerial spraying  can be accomplished with protection of other  National Forest resource values.  I. Protection Areas-NO SPRAY TO BE APPLIED  a. 100-foot strips paralleling streams having  bank slopes under 60%. (A 100% slope  is a 45° angle.)  b. A 200-foot strip paralleling streams hav­ing  bank s lopes from 60% to 100%.  c. A 400-foot strip along streams with bank  slopes steeper than 100%.  II. Spray areas and amounts  a. Adjacent to a non-spray area, the first  400-foot strip will receive 1/  2 pound DDT  per acre. This application will be made  with helicopter to insure tight control of  spray distribution.  b. Outside the 400-foot strip, fixed -wing  aircraft will be used to apply one pound  of pesticide per acre.  Ill. Additional Protection  Spraying operations will be constantly  monitored throughout the project by per­sonnel  of the Forest Service, the Idaho  Department of Fish and Game, and other  agencies. The non-spray strips will be  widened if necessary for stream protection.  WHAT'S AT STAKE  Aesthetic, wildlife, and watershed values involved  cannot be measured in dollars and cents. These  values do assume national importance in the  highly popular recreation and hunting and fish­ing  areas located on the Salmon National Forest,  par t icularly that area known as ""the Salmon  River country.""  The volume of timber alone makes the project  a necessity. In critical danger are 553 million  board feet - enough to build 50,000 modern  homes.  If the spruce budworm is allowed to go un­checked,  the forest will be destroyed and with  it values important to each of us.  YOU AND THE SPh.jy  The spray will be applied at rates which assure  satisfactory spruce budworm mortality, but  which have been demonstrated to be non-toxic  to humans. Fishery resources will be protected  by the carefully planned and tested spray pat­terns  described previously. (It should be pointed  out that the rate of application for agricultural  purposes exceeds this amount two to three  times.)  IS THERE DANGER TO YOU?  If you should happen to be in an area where the  spray is settling through trees, you, your chil­dren,  and your pets will not be harmed. You  may notice a momentary mild smog-like irrita­tion.  Any insecticide on clothing, cars, and other  items can be removed completely by washing or  dry cleaning. You are advised to cover exposed  food. These precautions are no different than  those you would normally make in applying in­secticide  around the home.  PROTECTING WILDLIFE  Last year's test project indicated that fish, birds,  wildlife, and domestic animals can be protected  under carefully controlled applications. Pre­cautions  include attention to spray concentra­tions,  stringent application rates, and prescribed  application patterns. Ground-to-air and air-t o­air  communications will provide immediate  observer control of aircraft to avoid possible  application problems. Flight patterns have been  set up to preclude spray reaching salmon­spawning  grounds, fishing waters, and other  critical areas.  Helicopter use in order to obtain close control of  spray distribution is a part of the project con­trol  for wildlife protection. No spraying will be  done when air movement will cause appreciable  drift or when temperatures will cause updrafts.  Idaho Department of Fish and Game biologists  will be on hand to assist in monitoring the wild­life  aspects of the project. Tight operational  control will insure that all instructions and pre­cautions  are carried out.  THE SPRl. BUDWORM  The last appearance of serious infestations re­quiring  control occurred on the Boise, Payette,  Salmon, Challis, and Targhee National Forests  during the years of 1955, 1956, and 1957. The  epidemic was successfully suppressed over t he  t hree-year period.  JULY- AUG.  The spruce budworm is one o1 ~ most poten­tially  destructive enemies of Douglas-fir and true  fir in North America. Principal damage results  from the caterpillars feeding on the new foliage.  Deformation and reduced growth or death of  the trees are t he inevitable results of sustained,  uncontrolled attacks of the pests. The insect  attacks trees of all ages indiscriminately.

PART VI - THE REGIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR FOREST PROTECTION FROM PESTS.  PART VII - A CHECKLIST OF THE REGION'S SERIOUS FOREST I NSECTS AND DISEASES.  Limited Distribution  ..  FOREWARD  Forest insects and diseases are ranked nationwide as the principal destructive  agents of timber. Combined, they destroy 7.3 billion board feet of timber  annually and cause a loss in volume growth of 21.2 billion board feet. The tim­ber  destroyed by pests each year is roughly equivalent to half the present annual  cut from the National Forests and is four to five times the amount destroyed by  fires Young trees and reproduction also sustain high but unmeasurable losses  even more serious than the destruction of old growth because they are the forests  of the futureo Thus, forest protection is a two-sided blade: one to protect the  supply of sawtimber and other forest products for the immediate years, and one to  assure forests for future generations.  The Region's Forests are vital to its economy, and sustained protection is essen­tial  to maintain a healthy industry. Thus, protection indirectly helps stabilize  dependent communities and the price of forest productso Equally as important, it  preserves the esthetic and scenic values of the forests, protects the wildlife  habitat and the watersheds, and prevents costly timber salvage programs from  areas on which the timber crop has been destroyed.  The threat of forest pests is constantly with us; but through combined vigilance,  skillful attack, and continuous additions to our knowledge on how best to combat  them, the damage they cause can be held to the lowest possible levels with the  least possible impact on other resourceso Control costs are high; but weighed  against values being protected, they usually are judged well worth the expenditure  of public funds o  2  Io THE OBJECTIVES AND BENEFITS OF FOREST PROTECTION FROM PESTSo  OBJECTIVES  * To provide a sustained supply of wood productso  * To protect useable water for hydroelectric power, industrial and domestic  use, and fish and aquatic-life habitat~  * To protect meadows , grass, brushlands, and other forage areas for wildlife  and domestic livestocko  * To provide a suitable habitat for fish and wildlife&  * To provide scenic areas for camping, vacationing, and recreationo  * To reduce resource-threatening insect infestations and forest diseases to  the lowest possible level consist ent with public safety, high economy, and  good multipl e-use l and management&  * To test promising new control methods, screen new, safer pesticides and  biological suppression agent s, to stuQy care~ any indications of  damage to other resources, and to adjust control techniques to prevent it.  * - To conduct all pest control activities safely without loss of life and  at the most favorable public cost-benefit ratio.

II. PUBLIC REGULATORY CONTROL OF PESTICIDESo  Regulation of the use of pesticides i n agriculture and forestr,y dates from  the adoption of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of  1947.. This was followed by the 1954 Miller Amendment to the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Acto These laws acknowledge the tremendous expansion of  pesticide use to meet the needs for increased agricultural and natural re­source  production.. They provide the controls necessary for the production  of an adequate, wholesome, and economic food supply and for public pro­tection  in the handling and use of insecticideso  3  To be considered suitable for use, a pesticide must pass laboratory tests  demonstrati~: (1) its effectiveness against specific pests when used as  proposed, (2) an absence of harmfUl effects against the plants or trees on  which it is needed, (3) safety for preserving the productivity of the soil  and the beneficial soil organisms, and (4) preservation of the quality of  the products being protectedG  In addition to the above action, the Government has taken further steps to  protect water values and wildlife and fish resources in forests or other  areas being sprayedo Tests called bioassays are made of all pesticides  licensed for useo These tests, in which animals and fish are used, as­certain  such effects as sensitivity, toxic dosages, effects on skin, eyes,  and other organs , and p~sical and mental effects generallyo  The protection by the public o fish and wildlife resources was given fur­ther  impetus b,y passage September 16, 1959, of Public Law 86-279 providing  for continuation in the Department of the Interior of studies ""on the effects  of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pesticides upon fish and  wildlife for the purpose of preventing losses of those invaluable natural  resourceSoeoe&lt;&gt;O E&gt;&lt;&gt;eO fl  In 1961, an international committee of European and American scientists was  organized to coordinate research on the harmful effects of pesticides on  wildlifeo The same year the President of the United States set up an inter­departmental  ""Pest Control Review Board"" to review all pesticide application  programs to insure proper precautions and wise use of pesticides.

All  4  these f actors are weighed and t he control strategy planned cooperatively  around the outcome of these studieso In Section III , the careful appraisal  of an entire control project will be reviewedo  IIIo WHAT A PEST CONTROL PROJECT RECOMMENDATION INVOLVESo  The Proposal  This Section will trace the steps t aken, l eading to the recommendation for  the 1963 Spruce Budwor.m Control Project on t he Targhee and Salmon National  Forests; depict t he resources involved, and relate something of t he careful  pl anning done prior to fiel controlo The story begins back in 1958 when  Regional entomologists observed increasi ng spruce budwor.m populations in  several National Forests contiguous to the Salmon and Snake River headwaters.  By 1960 in the Salmon and Targhee National Forest areas, 10,000 acres of  Douglas=fir-true fir timber were heavily damagedo The infestation also ex­t  ended over 226, 000 acres of light to moderate damageo The following year,  1961, 430,000 acres of t imber were showing serious damage and t he light to  moderately damaged ar ea had grown to 554, 000 acreso  Heavy damage sustained b.1 t he trees means nearly complete defoliation in any  one yearo Two or more year s of successive defoliation are frequently suffi­cient  to kill a l ar ger treeo Small trees and reproduction can be killed by  a severe defoliation in one yearo Thus, considerabl e losses may be sus­t  ained i n a t imber area receiving severe amage for more than one year.  The 1961 situation was as critical as any that had previously faced the  Regiono Control measures were recommended using the same methods employed  to suppress a similar epidemic successfully i n 1955-1957o A control project  proposal was sent to the Chief~s office of t he Unit ed States Forest Servi ce  in t he fall of 196lo However, because of the higher priority of other in­sect  infestations in timber in other parts of t he Region and the United  States, the project was bypassedo  By t he fall of 1962 the Tar ghee- Salmon National Forest epidemic had grown  to involve le6 million acres, about half this area being severely infested,  with losses imminent in the sawtimber and heavy losses in reproduction. A  decision was made to secure financing for about three-fourths of a million  acres of t he most serious infestatione The Federal Pest Control Review  Board had evaluated the project in the spring of 1962 and r eviewed it again  in the spring of 1963 before approval. Certain adjustments were made to  provide gr eater protection for the other resourceso Then in May, t he Congress  appr opriated funds to finance t he first phase in control of the insect by  aerial sprayo  The Resources Involved  lo Dougl as-fir and true fir timbere The 750,000 acres t hreatened contain  a sawtimber volume of about 5.3 billion board f eet with a stumpage value  of l 5o8 million dollars and a l umber value of 400 million dollarso  2a All the young trees and reproduction for our future forests with un­estimable  val ues .  3. Watersheds which are principal headwaters for the Salmon and Snake  Riverso  5  4o Forest scenic and recreation resources for the people in 78 communities  lying within the infestation zone or tributary to it and for thousands  of visitors annua.lly from all parts of the country o  5Q Soil, which supports the forests, is the basic resourceo  6o The headwaters of the Salmon River contain important chinook salmon  spawning groundso  7o Rich trout and salmon fishing resources attract prople from adjoining  States and from all over the United States b.1 the hundreds and thou­sands  ..  Bo Elk, deer, moose, and mountain sheep provide excellent wildlife resources.  9,. Boating down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and down the Salmon  River is considered a supreme sport, nationwideo  lOo The area is rich in birdlife, including several of the extremely rare  trumpeter swans.,  llo Adjacent to the control area are many diversified farms, including  dairying and fruit raisingo  12., Domestic livestock grazing is a major local industry, the National  Forest rangelands providing an important segment of the yearlong forage  supplyo  Needless to say, the problem of control is an area so rich in human and  natural resources is difficulto The timber resource must be protected with­out  causing si gnificant damage to all the other resourceso  Evaluation of Possible Control Choices  Several options were available ~  lo DD'l'o Very effective against spruce budworm proven on several major  control projects involving mi llions of acres of forestlands in the  West and in Canadae Its side effects are well known and the Forest  Service is more familiar with its use than any other pesticide. Costs  of application run from $0o75 to $2~ 00 per acre, depending on methods  of application usedo  2o Sevino This material shows promise, but no adequate field tests have  yet been madeo A decision was made to test its effectiveness against  spruce budworm on 10,000 acres of the Targhee National Forest in 1963Q  3o Phosphamidono Another promising pesticide that possesses systemic  qualitieso It is highlY toxic to mammals, but tests have shown it  less hazardous to fish than DDTo Cooperative field tests are proposed  to check its suitabil ityo It is expensive, costing probably one and  one- half to two times more per acre to spray forest land.  6  4. Bacillus thuringiensiso The cost is high, running about $15 per acre,  and little is known of its effect on spruce budwor.m. Application is  highly complicated and technicale It is being tested. It may be highly  selective with few side effectso  5. Do Nothing. This is a poor choi ce because scenic and recreation values  are destroyed, growth of timber is reduced, lumber production is cur­tailed,  fire hazards are increased, watershed values are lost, and re­forestation  is many times more costly than protectiono The old adage  of ""a stitch in time saves nine"" applies here.  After weighing all these possibili ties for control against the values at  stake and the objectives of the United States Forest Service, certain areas  were selected for control using DDTo  Some background for the use of DDT follows :  1948-1958 - Spruce budwor.m control in Oregon and Washington, 4,900,000  acres were sprayed with one pound of DDT in one gallon of  oil per acreo Control was 98 percent effective at a cost  of 99 cents per acre.  1955-1957 Spruce budworm control in Idaho; 2,013,747 acres were sprayed  with one pound of DDT in one gallon of oil per acre. Control  was 95 percent effective at a cost of 83 cents per acre.  In these projects, less than 10 percent of the forest area was covered. Less  than one percent has ever been sprayed twiceo The epidemics were controlled,  costs were acceptable, and as far as can be determined no significant damage  to other resources occurrede Our past record with the use of DDT in spruce  budworm control is good. However, this does not mean that we are contented.  The search to find safer, cheaper, and better means to control spruce bud­worm  and other destructive forest pests continueso  The Approved Project  After due consideration and approval by the Forest Pest Control Review Board,  the 1963 spruce budwor.m suppression project will comprise the following  activities:  1. One hundred ninety thousand acres to be sprayed on the Targhee National  Forest at the rate of one pound of DDT per acre. Spray will be modified  along streams, lakes, and reservoirs according to two methods as follows:  a. Cottonwood Creek, Camas Creek, and Howard Creek, Targhee National Forest.  (1)  (2)  No spray within one-fourth miles of these· streams.  !¥ ;k-  The next ooo 'Z.e:t., DDT applied ·at · the rate of'onb-hal·f pound per  acre by fixed-w:i;ng_ aircraft, - ·  7  (3) Remainci.er o.f infeste'i ar~a t.reat ed at rate of one pound per  acre 'cy .f:ixed-w:ir!f5 aircrafto  bo All other Creekso  •  (1) No spray within 100 feet of a sensitive area such ~s fishing  streamso  (2) A 300-foot zone adj oirJ.ng the 100-foot protection zone to be  sprayed b.Y helicopt er at one-half pound of DDT per acre.

(4) The remaining area will be sprayed with fixed-wing aircraft at  the rate of one pound of DDT per acreo  2o On the Salmon National Forest, a pilot test project to include salmon­spawning  areas will be carried out according to spray pattern bo above.  The objective of the test, which will include about 16,000 acres, is to  check the feasibility of sp:ruce budworzn ~..: ontr-ol in harmony •'lith the pro­tection  of the impor,ta':i:'·. sa.,mon-s.Paw.r.. .l .ng areas and other resources in  t.his vicinity o Complete control of the bu.dworm the following year on  the critically infested areas will then be reappraised on the basis of·  these testso Cooperating with Forest SeMrice sci entists in securing the  analyzing the data will be experts and scientific personnel from the  Idaho State Fish and Game Department and t he United States Fish and  Wildlife Serviceo  3~ A special test area of 10,000 acres in the Henr,y's Lake area, Targhee  National Forest, will be sprayed with Sevin using adequate controls to  test its effectiveness against spruce budworm and its relative effects  on fish and wi1dlife resourceso This will also be a cooperative study  between federal and state scientistso  IVo THE EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SPRAYSg  Many questions usually arise from peopl e in, or adjacent to, spray areas  and from agencies interested in t he resources involved in the control pro­jecto  Some of those questions m st frequent~ asked will be considered  hereo  lo How does DDT affect insects or other organisms with which ~t becomes  associated in the environment?  DDT causes poisoning either through contact with the skin or through  ingestion inside the organismo If consumed by an animal in continu­ing  doses, the pesticide tends to accumulate in the tissueso However,  if or~ one dose is appl ied, as in f orest insect control pr ojects, it  may be temporarily stored in the tissues of other animals contacting  it and gradually dissipateo Whereas nsects, such as the spruce bud­worm,  are easily killed on contact \'lith minute amounts of DDT on the  foliage, dermal applications to warmblooded animals are not norm~  8  hazardouso Insects are also easilY destroyed through ingestion of the  poisono Most of the effects on animals inhabiting spray areas are sus­t  ained through consuming pesticide on forage or other contaminated foodo  2o How are the deposits and effects of pesticides measured by scientists?  In two ways g (1) through measurement of a quantity of pesticide in­gested  by an organism and (2) by measuring the amount of pesticide de­posited  either on the outside or the inside of the plant or animalo  This latter is expressed on a basis of number of parts of pesticide per  million units of the sample materialo The common abbreviation for parts  per million is popomo and this is frequently seen in reports of scientific  studies on the subjecto As an example of the way this f actor is used,  the United States Food and Drug Administration has set up a series of  st andard ""tolerances"" or parts per million of pesticide material per­missible  in marketed food materialso For example, an established tol­erance  for beef f at in marketed meat is no more than seven parts per  milliono This means that meat may contain no more than seven units of  DDT in every million units of meat put on the marketo Naturally, the  agency has established this figure as a sa e level for human consumptiono  The accepted unit of measure for t he effects of DDT on animals is LD  50.. This means the amount of insecticide required to kill 50 percent  of the test animalso It is measured in quantities of insecticide applied  in relationship to the weight or the organism or animalo This r elation­ship  is expressed in milligrams of insecticide per kilogram of animal  weighto For example, the oral LD 50 for laborator,y animals r anges from  150 to 300 mgo/kgo, meaning that a dose of 150 to 300 milligrams of DDT  pel' 1·,000 grams of animal weight will kill half' the t est animalso This  same r atio expressed in pounds would be ol5 to o30 pounds of DDT per  1,000 pounds of animal weighto Ip other words, if one were to · feed a  1,000 pound cow a third of a pound of DDT ever,r day for a week, the cow  would have a 50-50 chance of' survivalo  3.. If DDT gets into a stream, how long will it l ast?  Spray contamination in streams l asts only a short periodo Studies have  shown that the greatest amount of stream contamination has occurred  within one-half hour after spraying at any one point and that within an  hour after spray~ contamination was considerably reducedo  Two things happen to spray in a streamg  ao It moves downstream with the waterfiowo  bo It is diluted by mixing with water and becomes less and less  dangerous as mixing proceeds by dispersing any concentrations  of the materialo  DDT has been recorded in stream water as far as 10 miles below a sprayed  areao The distance that detectable amounts may persist depends on the  amount getting into the stream and the volume of watero  9  4~ What is the effect of DDT on fish and other aquatic life?  Fish can be killed with as little as OoOl parts per million in the  water, aquatic insects with even lessG However, the aquatic insects  usually repopulate the streams in one to twelve monthso Anadromous  fis~ such as the ocean-going salmon in the headwaters of the Salmon  River are very sensitiveo These fish must rely on natural methods of  regenerationo Such sensitivity requires great caution and careful pre­paration  and handling of aerial application projects to preserve the  resource within its natural environmento Special precautions devised  to handle this situation on t he current project are descri bed in Part  IIIo  It is known that DDT concentrations also accumulate in water algae and  current studies are underway to determine how long the chemical remains  in plant tis su es~  5o How l ong will DDT last when deposited on forage?  Spray residue will persist for about 30 days on foliageo Where possible,  milk cows should be kept away from sprayed forage for 30 days to prevent  milk contaminationo No hazard should exist for meat animals because  designed spray application will not permit the building up in the fat  tissue above the accepted tolerance level of 7 parts per milliono  6e How much Sevin or DDT woul a person or an animal have to eat to cause  damage? ·  No tests have been made of the toxic effects of these two chemicals on  human beingsc However, in one case, members of two families became ill  after eating greens bearing residues of 3,200 parts per million of a  chlorinated hydrooarbono DDT is a chlorinated hydrocarbon& No deaths  or permanent afflictions occurredo  Cows have consumed 200 parts per million of DDT in their diet for 18  weeks without serious ill effects~  Sevin is considerably l ess toxico Tests have shown that it took 2,000  to 100, 000 m] JJi grams of chemical per kilogram of body weight to kill  one young birdo  7o What is the effect of DDT on birdli e in t he spray area?  There is no evidence that one pound of spray per acre will have any  effect on birdse This statement is from observation on many spray pro­jects  using the above concentrationo However, spraying will kill many  of the insects which provide food for birdso Shortage of food usually  causes birds to leave the areao  8o Supposing some milk cows are accidentally sprayed or they eat some DDT  on their forageo What would be the effect on the milk?  To test the effect, some cows were turned into a sprayed pasture and  the concentration in milk built up to 9 parts per millionD After 10  days, 2 parts per million still r emained a  10  Cows turned i nto the pasture 14 days after spraying showed a maximum  of concentrations of 1 part per million in t he milk but none after 10  additional days of grazingo Cows turned into the field 30 days after  spraying showed no DDT residue in their milko  The Federal Food and Drug Administration will not permit milk to be  sold if it contains any DDT residue ..  9.. How long would DDT l ast if stored in animal tissue?  About 50 percent remains after one month, 25 percent after t hree months  if no more DDT i s consumedo he amount remaining stored in animal tissue  depends upon the evel of ingest on and t he l engt h of time over which  the intake occursc Large doses accumulate in t he tissues more rapidly  than small doseso  lOo Is there an intake l evel at which no fat storage of DDT occurs?  Accumulation i n f at is possible from a 1 part per million l evel in the  f ood.,  llo Is age related to fat storage of DDT?  Fat storage of DDT is at the same rate in weanlings and four-month old  r ats ..  12.. What i s the lowest level of intake at which DDT may produce pathological  effects?  Evidence of liver injury has been noted in r ats consuming diets con­taining  5 parts per million DDT for four to six monthso  13.. How much DDT is sprayed at a one-pound er acre r ate?  If the application rate is one pound per acre and the amount falls on  one acre-foot of wat er, the DDT concentration in the water would be  Oo375 parts per milliono  14.. Why aren't some s afer controls developed, like the use of parasites,  predators, or insect disease?  Tests are being conducted in 1963 on all spruce budwor.m control pro­jects  in the West to tr,r to fin a met hod qy which budworm populations  can be satisfactorily reduced with l ess danger to fish, wildlife and man.  Various specific biotic and systemic chemicals are being tried.. Also,  a wide research program on natural enemies continues , and safer methods  of pesticide application are constantly being developed.  In reviewing the answers to the above questions, i t must be remembered that  specific information on the effects of pesticides is limited, primarily be-  11  cause the science of pesticide toxicology is a new science, much of it  devel oped only since the advent of modern agricultural chemical industry  after World War II., The above answers are based on t he best infor-mation  obt ainable., There is a wide variation in test results, depending on the  condit ions under which the tests were made, and of course no two control  operations present the s rune set of conditionso This i s t he reason for  developing an entirely new control s,ystem for each infes t ation or disease  o tbreak where resource protection is required in the public interest .,  Vo THE PUBLICWS STAKE IN PEST CONTROL  Americans are t he most efficient, pro ctive people i n t he worl do ·They  continually irect heir efforts towar producing crops , livestock, forest  products, and other commodi i es on fewer acres with l ess l abor and at lower  costo Nineteen ou of t enty Americans live and work in towns and cities  and are not :involved with agric ture and forestryo These commodities in  abundance have become an accepted way of lifeo  Here are a few reasons for this affluence~  le Adequate quaran~ine services to prevent the intr oduction of foreign  insect and disease pestso  2~ Successful eradication programs for both pests , human, and animal  parasiteso  3o Cooperation among Federal, St ate, and private agencies in prosecuting  research and era ication campai gnso  4o Chemical control measureso  5o Biological control measureso  6o Basic research programso  7., Sil vicul tural and management controls o  Regardless of these measures an activities to hold pest losses to low levels,  damage to agricultural crops an forest resources are costly, r equiring the  expenditure of between ten and twenty billion ollars annually o At t he same  time, t he Nati on enjoys the following r esults from expenditures to reduce  pest damageg  lo The food and forest product dollar buys two to three times more than  it would without pest protective measureso  2o Lumber is in good supply and cheaper than if a high rate of pest damage  were allo ed to continue o  J., Maey foods an forest roducts wo  pest controls ..  be luxury items were it not for  .:  12  As in other forest management and protection activi t i es, control programs are  coordinated with overall mult iple use administration to insure balanced land  management, For example , the applicati on of a pesticide must be checked  for any effect it may have on f ish, wildlife, grazing animals, and humans  utili zing the .same areas . A ceaseless vigil is essential to detect threaten­ing  organisms. To mai ntain a healthy i ndustry sustained on a continuous  flow of products is vital to the Region ' s economy. This in turn helps  stabili ze communi t i es . Protection of the esthetic values and watershed  functions are other dividends of a good insect and disease suppression  program.  VI . THE REGIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR FOREST PROTECTION FROM PESTS  It i s the function of t he Regional Di vision of Timber Management to provide  through the Regional Forester t o the Forest Supervisors of the eighteen  Intermountain National Forests adequate preventi on, detection, and evalua­t  ion services for the destructive insect and disease pests, and to coordinate  these and suppr essi on activiti es with the respective state, private, and  other Federal personnel. These servi ces are centered in three sections  of the Br anch of Forest Insect and Di sease Prevention and Control, 509 Kiesel  Buildi ng, Ogden, Utah. Briefly, their activities are described as follows:  :Qete.cti on and Evaluati on Section:  1 . Conduct ann al aerial detection surveys, covering all I ntermountain  Nati onal Forest timbered areas as well as the Department of the ' Interior  forested lands by cooperatiye agreement . Detection on state or other  lands are made on request and r eported promptly.  2. Aerial surveys are fol lowed by biological evaluations on the ground  Whenever suspected pest activities are detected from the air or reported  by others. These evaluati ons apprai se the current and potential signi­ficance  of an insect outbreak.  3· Biologi cal evaluations are made on other than National Forest lands  upon request from ot her Federal, state,· l ocal, or private land managers  or owners . Training services are also provided for personnel from  these agencies .  4. An annual report and summary of current insect situation and potential  i s provided to all owners and managers of f9rest lands in the Region.  Insect Control Secti on :  1 . Secure or provide technical advice and assistance on insect control  projects in Region Four and on other Federal, state, or private forest  lands .  2. Maintain a comprehensi ve knowledge of modern pesticides, chemical and  biological controls, and pest control equipment .  3. Gui de operat ional ground surveys and handle biological problems en­countered  on control projects.  13  4. Report annually on recommended pest control projects and accomplishments.  5. Make i nspections of control projects to assure that satisfactory control  methods are followed and that control is effective.  Forest Pathology Section ~  1. Direct Nati onal Forest di sease de_tection, evaluat ion, and surveys and  advise feasible control measures .  2. Provi de techni cal advice on diseases and assistance on disease control  projects in the Region~nd on other Federal, state, or private lands.  3. Work cooperati vely with other Forest Pathologists and disease control  workers to reduce the overall disease potential .  4 . Maintai n a comprehensive knowledge of forest diseases, disease-insect  relationshi ps, and biological systemic disease controls.  5. Make i nspect ions of control pr ojects .  The Regi onal Forester by the above means, provides the specialized services  and aids requi red by the Forest Supervi sors on t he eighteen Nati onal Forests  of t he Intermountai n Regi on to accomplish the control within tolerable  limit s of the destructive array of forest pests. Prevention and control  activities extend over nearly thirty-one milli on acres of National Forests  and on other forest lands when the land managing agencies request these  services. The Forest Pest Control Act of 1947, provides for the cooperative  protection of all f orest lands agai nst forest pests as follows ~  Federal Forest Pest Control Act of 1947  Public Law 110 - 80th Congress  Chapter 141 = 1st Sessi on  (s . 597)  (61 Stat . 177)  Atr Act  To provide f or the protecti on of forests agai nst destructive i nsects and  disease, and f or other purposes .

S. Department of Agriculture  Ogden, Utah  c I  . -  SPRUCE BUDWORM INFESTATIONS  Forest Service Region Four  November 1964  INTRODUCTION  The spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem . ), occurs throughout  fir stands of the United States and Canada. It is believed to be in­digenous  to the West but was not recorded as an important pest until  1923, at which time two outbreaks were reported in separate areas in  Idaho.  In U. S. Forest Service, Region Four, the spruce budworm feeds on  Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and the true firs. Previ ous outbreaks  have been most serious on the National Forests of central-southern  Idaho . The first control project in the Region against this pest was  carried on from 1955 through 1957· Altogether, over 2.2 million acres  were sprayed. The present epidemic in southern Idaho has been active  since 1958 and covers much of the same area infested from 1951 through  1957. In 1963, suppressive action was initiated against this o~tbreak  by spraying slightly more than 200,000 acres with DDT . In 1964,  525,000 acres were treated by aerial application of DDT. In both  years the dosage rates varied from t to 1 pound of DDT per acre and  the insecticide was applied by fixed wing aircraft and helicopter.  This year small, localized epidemic infestations of the budworm were  detected on the Fishlake National Forest in southern Utah. In the past  the spruce budworm has not been considered a primary pest in the conif­erous  forests of Utah .  METHODS  A combination of air and ground techniques was used to gather evaluation  data on the present spruce budworm situation. Mapping the infestation  boundaries and delineation of broad classes of current damage was accom­plished  by aerial surveys. The groundwork involved examination of larval  populations, pupal case~sounts, and an egg mass survey. The sequential  plan developed by Cole 1J was used as a guide in surveying larval ~gpu­lation.  Pupal density data were collected by following Terrell's ~  sequential table procedure which categorizes expected damage into four  classes. The egg mass survey procedur~s were adopted from suggestions  and findings of Carolin and Coulter. 11  One thousand square inches of foliage were used as the sampling unit for  the egg mass survey. Each sample was put into a separate 50 pound flour  sack. At least five samples were collected from each sampling point.  The bags of foliage were picked up twice weekly and transported to  Ogden. All egg mass counts were made in the Region's laboratory at  Ogden, Utah, under the direct supervision of an experienced laboratory  technician. Esti~~tion of eggs Ber mass was obtained by using tables  prepared by Bean ~and Terrell g/with some adaptations. An egg mass  adjustment was made to compensate for variations in the numbers of  eggs per mass. The same system was used successfully in 1962 and again  in 1963 to predict the succeeding year's damage.  Spider mites have caused serious injury to conifers following some spruce  budworm spray projects. For this reason spider mite populations on  Douglas-fir branches were sampled by the use of a mite brushing machine.  !/ Walter E.

One and six-tenths million acres were  reported as having suffered visible defoliation in 1963. Of the total  acreage presently infested, 6o perc~nt was heavily defoliated compared  to the same percent age in 1963 and 48 percent in 1962.  The following table gives a comparison of the acreage by damage classes  from 196o through 1964 for the southern Idaho infestations:  Damage Class in Acres  Year Light Medium Heavy Total  1960 297,000 80,000 19,000 396,000  1961 643,000 229,000 553,000 1,425,000  1962 480,000 373,000 788,000 1,641,000  1963 357,760 276,550 988,788 1,623,098  1964 266,000 658,000 1,352,000 2,276,000  Slightly over 525,000 acres of the 1964 infestation were sprayed this  year.  In this report the three damage classes are defined by ""estimated  percent of current foliage destroyed,"" and are as follows:  Light - Any defoliation visible from the air, usually between  20 and 50 percent.  Medium - 50 to 75 percent defoliation.  Heavy - Over 75 percent defoliation.  Four distinct infestations are discussed under the following headings:  Salmon River infestation; Targhee National Forest infestation; Sawtooth  National Forest infestation; and the new outbreak affecting about  20,000 acres on the Fishlake National Forest in Utah.  Salmon River Infestation  The Salmon River infestation covers parts of tq.e Salmon, Challis, Payette,  and Boise National Forests . It occurs along the main Salmon River Drain­age  below Dillinger Creek in the Idaho Primitive Area, upriver nearly to  Challis, Idaho. In addition, the main side drainages (Middle Fork,  Panther Creek, Lemhi River, and North Fork) are infested . There are also  several small spot infestations. (See map.)  -4-  Acreage by damage class is given in the following table:  1964 Salmon River Infestation  Area Light Medium Heavy Total  Outside Primi-tive  Area  Salmon N.

The 1964 infestation covers 2,155,000 acres which is a sizeable increase  over the 1963 acreage of 1,312,000 acres. About 359,000 acres of the  total are in the Idaho Primitive Area and 6oO,OOO acres are within the  1964 control boundaries .  The 1964 spruce budworm spray program included all the infested areas  north of the main Salmon River, and the Panther Creek Drai nage . (See  map.) Within the control boundaries an untreated acreage t otaling  75,000 acres was left along streams to minimize possible adverse effects  to fish and fish food organisms. A one-half pound dosage was applied  to 4o,ooo acres along a strip between the one pound concentrations and  the unsprayed stream sides. The remaining 485,000 acres were sprayed  with one pound per acre. Satisfactory control was achieved on the area  sprayed with one ~ound DDT per acre. However, 23 percent of the area  sprayed with the 2 pound dosage was assessed as unsatisfactory . The  egg mass survey also reflects the reduction of budworm population within  the control area. Separate samples were taken within the one pound,  one-half pound, and no-spray zones. Egg mass density averaged 2.8 per  1000 square inches of foliage sampled in the area sprayed with one  pound of DDT per acre. Defoliation in this zone is expected to be  15 percent or less next year . In the area sprayed at the rate of  one-half pound DDT per acre, egg mass density averaged 3·5 per 1000  square inches of foliage. The expected defoliation in this zone in  1965 is 15-25 percent. In the untreated protective zones along  -5-  streams, the samples averaged 5.1 egg masses per 1000 square inches of  foliage. Defoliation in the untreated zones is expected to average  between 25-50 percent. There was, however, considerable variation in  egg mass density in the untreated zone. Therefore, intensity of defolia­tion  is expected to vary considerably in the untreated zone .  No biological evaluations or egg mass surveys were made in the Idaho  Primitive Area.  Outside the Primitive Area 955,000 infested acres remained untreated  in 1964. It is expected that next year's defoliation will exceed  90 percent on about 45 percent ofl this area or 430,000 acres. Defolia­tion  should range between 51-90 percent on another 45 percent, and on  the remaining 10 percent of the area defoliation will probably be less  than 50 percent.  Spider mites were present in relatively large numbers in all areas of the  budworm infestation sampled. The fall population density averaged 12  and ranged from 1.0 to 32.0 mites per 100 square inches of foliage.  With the resident population of spider mites at a high level, it is  quite possible the 1965 mite population may increase sharply in the  area sprayed this year.  A summary of the evaluation data is shown in the following tables. In  each table the last column is a reflection of the entomologist's  opinion based upon egg mass and pupal density data tempered by on-the­ground  interpretation. This method has been used for prediction  purposes for the last three years and has proved to be more reliable  than prediction based solely on egg mass density.  -6-  SALMON NATIONAL FOREST  1964 Spruce Budworm Evaluation  Area Treated in 1964  Salmon River  1964 1964 Adjusted Mean 1964 Damage Level  Damage Pupal No. Egg Masses Egg Mass  Sample Area Level Class 1000 Sq.

Five out of six of the collections  containing parasitized eggs were from nonsprayed areas along the streams;  the other was in an area sprayed with one-half pound of DDT per acre.  Four of the collections with egg parasites were located in three widely  scattered locations north of the main Salmon River. Two collections  were from units just across Panther Creek from each other. On the  six areas containing some parasitism, the number Qf egg masses with  parasitized eggs ranged from 11 to 100 percent. The egg parasite was  identified as Trichogramma minutum Riley.  In summary, the conditions on the Salmon River infestation are as  follows: Nearly one million acres of the present infestation have  been subjected to repeated defoliation since 1961. On considerably  over' one-helf of this area, defoliation has exceeded 90 percent for  at least the last three years. Tree mortality has occurred at an  accelerated rate over the last three years and is now substantial in  areas which have received repeated heavy defoliation. The 1964 spray  project materially reduced the budworm population on 600,000 acres.  However, on the remaining untreated 955,000 acres outsid.e the Idaho  Primitive Area the epidemic tend.encies of the spruce budworm persist  and damage to next year's growth should be equal or greater than that  experienced this year.  -9-  Targhee National Forest  In 1963 slightly over 200,000 acres of budworm infestation on the  Targhee National Forest were included in the Region's budworm control  project. Since spray is applied after feeding occurs, the spray program  did not materially reduce .the damage caused by the 1963 populations .  However, as measured by larval mortality, excellent control was obtained;  and, the results of the 1963 egg mass survey also reflected a reduction  of budworm population. It was predicted that on most of the area treated  in 1963 defoliation would be less than 25 percent in 1964. Damage  evaluation made in 1964 showed all but one unit was defoliated to the  level predicted in 1963. The exception was West Camas Creek Unit where  defoliation was consid.erably lower than expected .  Predictions based on the 1964 spruce budworm egg mass and pupal density  surveys indicate that on over 85 percent of the area treated in 1963,  the 1965 defoliation should be less than 25 percent . Only 6 percent  of the area should receive defoliation of over 50 percent.  Visible defoliation was detected in three new areas this year. One  is located on the west side of Henry's Lake, in the Dillon Creek area  where trees on 3,600 acres were lightly defoliated, and another on  the northeast slopes of Sawtelle Peak where an area of 1,800 acres  also show light defoliation. The third area is on the extreme western  edge of the Targhee National Forest between Hahn and Key Spring.  Defoliation covered a total of 10,480 acres, 2,280 of which were  moderately defoliated, with the remainder barely visible from the air.  This infestation is actually an extension of the Lemhi River portion  of the Salmon River infestation. In all the new areas next year 's  defoliation is expected to equal or exceed that occurring this year.  Spider mite populations built up on most areas treated in 1963.  Damage was severe enough in a few areas to cause a general reddening  of the foliage, readily visible from t he air. The areas most seriously  affected by the spider mites were West Camas Creek, Bear Gulch,  Cottonwood Creek, West Dry Creek, and Willow Creek. Measurements  indicate high mite populations are likely to occur again next year in  most of the 1963 treated areas. Mite population densities ranged  from 3.2 to ,lOl.O per 100 square inches of foliage with an overall  average of 25.0. The areas with the heaviest fall mite populations  include all areas with heavy mite damage this year except West Dry  Creek. In addition, heavy mite populations were recorded in Picnic  Hollow, Yale Creek, Taylor Creek and Snider Creek.  Considering the Targhee National Forest infestation as a whole, con­trol  action next year does not seem advisable . However, some budworm  population is still present throughout the area treated. in 1963, and  there are three new spots of infestation where the population may  increase. Subsequent evaluations will provide the basic criteria to  determine .if and when additional control action may be necessary.  -10-  TARGHEE NATIONAL FOREST  1964 Spruce Budworm Evaluation  1964 1964 Adjusted Mean 1264 Dama6e Level  Damage Pupal No .

During this period there have been several  rather sudden population declines. On two occasions the population  reductions took place when the budworm was in the moth stage. The  reductions were caused by torrential rainstorms that dxowned a high  proportion of the moths before the eggs were deposited.  From t961 through 1963 there was a general increase in the acreage  infested. and the intensity of damage caused by 'the spruce budworm on  the Sawtooth National Forest. The 1964 aerial survey recorded a slight  reduction in total area with current damage visible from the air. In  addition, there was a marked reduction in the acres that were heavily  defoliated. The following table shows the acreage by damage level  as seen from the air for the last four years.

On the remaining 40 percent of the area, def9liation should range  between 25 and 50 percent of the current year's growth. Prediction  for individual areas is given in the following table. The mite  populations appear to be at a low level in the budworm infested areas  of the Sawtooth National Forest.  -12-  SAWIOOTH NATIONAL FOREST  1964 Spruce Budworm Evaluation  1964 1964 Adjusted Mean  IB.mage Pupal No. Egg Masses  Sample Area Level Class .1000 Sq.

One small out break desig­nated  as the Thousand Lake Mountain infestation, located approximately  one mile north of the Elkhorn Ranger Station in the southeast portion  of the Fishlake National Forest was detect ed last August. The infesta­tion  covers about 500 acres of Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce and true  fir timber. There was no indication of previous defoliation by the  spruce budworm in this area. Defoliation of 1964 growth varied from  50 to 75 percent . Pupal density fell within Class III and there was  an average of 12.2 egg masses per 1000 square inches of foliage. This  data indicate defoliation of next year's growth should range between  51 to 90 percent.  To our knowledge, this is the first verified account of an epidemic  spruce budworm infestation in Utah.  The other outbreak is located in the extreme southwest corner of the  Fishlake National Forest just east of Beaver, Utah. This infestation  is approximately 70 air miles west of the Thousand Lake Mountain  infestation and is separated by large open vall eys.  Defoliation visible from the air covered 19,500 acres in the heads of  Birch and South Creeks. National Forest personnel detected an increase  in budworm activity in the South Fork of the Beaver River and in the  South Fork of North Creek. Both of these areas are north of where  damage was visible from the air. It is therefore quite possible the  total area infested with budworm may be two or more times as large as  that seen from the air. Unfortunately, this infestation was detected  too late in the season to evaluate its potential.

Of this total 20,000 acres are  in new infestations on the Fishlake National Forest in Utah. Six  hundred thousand acres of infestation are within the area treated  this year by aerial application of DDT. Slightly more than 200,000  acres were treated in 1963. The present infestation covers 359,000  acres of timberland in the Idaho Primitive Area. One and one-tenth  million acres are located in southern Idaho outside the Primitive  Area and have not been treated within the last seven years.  This year throughout the infestation areas the new growth on Douglas­fir  was abnormally long. In many areas the shoots wer e more than  twice the length of those produced in 1962 and 1963. Iamage assess­ment  is based upon the 'percentage of new growth destroyed . Consequently,  when growth elongation occurs, the actual damage to the infested trees  is not as severe in a given damage class as it is when new growth is  short; i.e., d.efol:i.ation of 50 percent of the foliage on two inches  of new growth leaves one inch of unaffected growth, whereas if 50  percent of the f ol iage of a one -inch shoot is destroyed only one-half  inch of foliage per tip remains to sustain life in the tree .  Growth elongation makes aerial assessment of current year damage  difficult, with the usual effect being a conservative estimate of  damage classes.  Egg mass sampling data implies the surviving budMorm population in  the 1964 control area varied inversely with the amount of DDT applied.  Therefore, in general damage next year will be heaviest in the non­treated  protection zones and lightest in· areas treated with one  pound of DDT per acre.  Egg mass surveys are useful for predicting the next season's defoli a ­tion.  However, there are many variables and uncertainties that prevent  complete reliance on egg mass densities alone. It is important for  this reason, that trained entomologists assist in the coll ection of  the foliage samples so that on-the- ground observations can be made .  Interpretation and analysis of biological and environmental characteris­tics  supply the evidence to support or supplement the egg mass surveys.  Pupal case density measurements can be obtained readily while assessing  the current year's damage . Pupal case densities have proven to be  valuable aids in the overall interpretation of the budworm situation.  Experienced laboratory people trained to recognize differences in egg  mass and deposition patterns can also supply data helpful in the  interpretation of the findings. This year the laboratory technician  discovered. that for the last three years there has been a close  correlation between the age of an infestation and the size and shape  of budworm egg masses. In new infestations a majority of the egg  masses contain two rows of eggs, but· in areas where the budworm remains  -15-  epidemic over a period of years, the number of rows of eggs per mass  gradually changes until a majority of the egg masses contain three to  four r ows of eggs. The data upon which this observation is made needs  to be subjected to analysis and additional study. If proven valid,  knowledge of this phenomenon would aid. in evaluations of budworm  infestations.  Spider mite density per 100 square inches of foliage was measured;  however, at this point, no definite prognostication can be made.  Nevertheless, the presence of spider mite populations, especially in  damaging numbers such as now occur in the 1963 project area, should  serve as a warning that spider mites might become a problem wherever  DDT is used to control the spruce budworm. Meaningful damage classes  related to population density of spider mites need to be d.eveloped .  Collection of data that can be used for this purpose can be made in  connection with evaluation of spruce budworm populations.  There was a significant increase in spruce budworm egg parasites in  several localities within areas sprayed in 1964. Careful evaluation  of this phenomonen should. be continued to determine if and when these  parasites might exert a controlling influence on the spruce budworm  population.  RECOMMENDATIONS  Direct control action on all the spruce budworm infestations in southern  Idaho except the 1963 and 1964 control project areas is justified from  an entomological interpretation. Budworm populations are present  within the areas treated in the last two years, but no immediate need  for respraying is apparent.  There is little question that all of the budworm population outside  the control areas in the Salmon River infestation is epidemic, with  a definite trend for increasing. Heavy defoliation over a majority  of the infestation has occurred for the last several years causing  severe damage to the Douglas-fir stands.  Control action directed against the Sawtooth infestation would be  justified on the basis of present population density. However, since  this population has declined rapidly on several previous occasions  after rapid buildups of three or four years, it seems advisable to  wait at least another year before control action is undertaken.  The infestation on the Fishlake National Forest needs more intensive  evaluation before recommendation for or against suppressive action  can be made.  -16-  Approve~ {2,  ~rossenbach  Branch Chief  rate ;;if¢ sf  rate /2- /~ - 4 i  ~cdL  Section Chief  FISHLAKE IIATICIUL FCBBST  BeaTer  spruce budworm  1964  r  )  '  I  ----~l--~ c~~-~-iR·si;~·;HE~~-;~~--fT-~&gt;-;;-....~~  ., N1TIONAL M O N UMi;:NT  I  1  ' 27 28 .__..._.r,-oilliooiii.-+'iilL,l ~--·--t -·-- ·-  I ' i .

Measure and analyze so far as possible the impacts and effects on  terrestrial wildlife from the DDT aerial spray program.  B. Measure and analyze so far as possible the impacts and effects on  terrestrial wildlife from the testing program for using Cygon  (Dimethoate).  II. Responsibility and Cooperation.  A.  B.  c.  D.  E.  F.  The Monitor Coordinator is responsible to the Project Leader for  organizing, planning, coordinating, conducting, and reporting on  all phases of the monitoring program.  The Project Game Biologist assigned to monitoring is the Monitor  Coordinator's representative, and is directly responsible to him  for planning, coordinating, conducting, and reporting the terrestrial  wildlife monitoring program.  The Idaho Fish & Game Department will participate in the terrestrial  monitoring program within the guidelines of the cooperative agreement  between the u. s. Forest Service and the State. The State Area Big  Game Biologist will represent the State in coordinating the program  with the Project Game Biologist. Job assignments are as set out in  this study plan.  The Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife will be represented by a  Research Biologist from the Branch of Wildlife Research, Denver  Wildlife Research Center. Branch personnel will act as consultants  in various aspects of the terrestrial wildlife monitoring and will  participate in jobs according~o the schedule shown in this study  plan, so far as they can finance and furnish manpower and laboratory  assistance.  Personnel from the Agricultural Research Service, Yakima, Washington,  will (1) cooperate in a consulting capacity for sampling designs and  procedures, (2) analyze residues in samples as scheduled in this plan,  and (3) report findings to the Regional Forester, U. s. Fo~est Service,  Ogden, Utah.  Other wildlife agencies, schools or organization&will be invited to  observe the spray program and the monitoring program. Copies of  study plans and reports .will be furnished those having a direct  concern with the area and this project.  III. Terrestrial Wildlife and the DDT Spray Project. . .  .l. Mule Deer  ..  1. Pre-Spray  a. Up to five adult males will be collected by rifle from the  spray area within the Panther Creek drainage - Idaho Fish &  Game Department.  b. Adipose fat samples approximating five grams will be removed  from each animal and placed in numbered glass vials supplied  by the Agricultural Research Servic·e - Forest Service and  Idaho Fish & Game Department.  c. Tissue samples from the liver, kidney, aarenal and thyroid  glands will be removed and placed in individual plastic  bags. A larger plastic bag numbered to correspond to the  fat sample will be used for storage and shipping. - Forest  Service, Fish & Wildlife Service, and Idaho Fish & Game.  d. A rumen sample will be removed, strained through cheesecloth  and placed in a double plastic bag. The bag will be numbered  to correspond to the fat sample. - Forest Service, Fish &  Wildlife Service, and Idaho Fish & Game.  e. An attempt will be made to take adult deer by means of a  ""capture"" gun. By biopsy a rump fat sample will be taken  from each captured animal. The animal will then be con­spicuously  marked and released for possible future recovery.  2. Post-Spray.  a. Approximately 30 to 45 days after spraying, up to ten adult  males will be collected by rifle from spray areas in Panther  Creek. - Idaho Fish & tame. Removal of sample material will  be carried out as before. - Forest Service and Idaho Fish &  Game.  2  b. Following spray operations and prior to the general hunting  season, an effort will be made to recover marked animals by  means of a rifle. If marked animals will still be at large  during the 1964 deer season, hunters in the area will be  alerted to the importance of reporting kills of these animals.  If a kill is reported, every effort will be made to obtain a  rump fat sample. ~  c. General Deer Season - 1964: Adipose fat samples will be  removed from hunter kills from the Panther Creek drainage  above Napias Creek. Efforts will be made to include fawn  samples. - Idaho Fish & Game.  d. General Deer Season - 1965: The same procedure will be  followed as for the general season of 1964, except that  efforts will be made to especially include fawns and yearlings  in the sampling. - Idaho Fish & Game.  e. General Deer Season - 1966: The S8J!le procedure will be  followed making efforts to include samples from fawns,  yearlings, and two and one-half year old animals. - Idaho  Fish & Game.  3. Controls  During the 1964 general deer season, adipose fat samples will be  taken from 15 to 20 adult mule deer taken from Boise and Elmore  counties. - Idaho Fish & Game.  B. Elk  1. During the 1964 elk season adipose fat samples will be taken  from up to ten elk killed within the spray project area.  Locations of kills will be determined as closely as possible  and recorded. - Idaho Fish & Game.  2. As controls, adipose fat samples will be taken from up to ten  elk killed in the elk hunt in Boise and Elmore Counties. -  Idaho Fish & Game.  3· The same method of handling and shipment will be followed as  for deer taken in the 1964 deer hunting season.  c. Mountain Goats.  1. Adipose fat samples will be taken from hunter kills during the  1964 Horse Creek control hunt. - Idaho Fish & Game.  2. For control purposes, adipose fat samples will be taken from  up to ten animals taken during the 1964 Pahsimeroi hunt.  Idaho Fish & Game.  3. The same method of handling and shipment will be followed as  for deer taken in the 1964 hunting season.  D. Mountain Sheep.  1. Adipose fat samples will be taken from hunter kills taken  within the spray project area during the 1964 open hunt • .. ..  2. The same method of handling and shipment will be followed as  for deer in the 1964 hunting season.  E. Song Birds  1. Sampling for residue analyses.  ti  . .  a. Pre-Spray.  (1) Five robins will be collected by shotgun from spray  areas. - Forest Service  (2) The beak, feet, and akin will be removed from each bird  and discarded. The crop and stomach will be removed  and bagged as a separate sample. The carcass will be  bagged and both portions identified as from the same  bird.  b. Post-Spray.  Five robins will be collected from the spray area at 15-day  intervals with a maximum of four post-spray sampling periods.  Handling will be carried out in the same manner as with the  pre-spray samples. - Forest Service.  2. Census.  The purpose of this portion of the study is ·to determine if this  particular census technique has merit for evaluating the effects  of spray projects on bird populations or movements. It may serve  as a partial indication of a limited population dynamics as a  result of spray treatment. It will not serve as inventory of  population dynamics of this spr~roject. This study will be  done by the Project Game Biologist with possible assistance  from Dr. Keith Dixon, Ornithologist, Utah State University,  and the Research Biologist, Bureau of Sport Fisheries and  Wildlife.  •  a. Two 40 acre square study plots w~l be established within the  spray area in Panther Creek. Location will be identified on  aerial photos. Environmental descriptions will be written  for each plot. Efforts will be made to locate the plots in  the following types:  (1) Douglas-fir with closed or nearly closed canopy.  (2) Browse field or mixed br9wse and open Douglas-fir  canopy which will most likely be sp~ayed.  b. Census s~rips will be marked by string lines in such a way  that the entire'study plot will be censused.  c. Two or three days prior to spraying a sunrise census will  be made of all birds found within each study plot.  4  d. Two or three days following spraying the plots will again be  .censused.  e. Any dead birds found withi n these plots, or anywhere within  the project, will be preserved for residue analyses.  F. Vegetation.  The purpose of this sampling will be to determine the persistence  of DDT residues on forage species. The project plans provide for  protection of meadows wherever practical. The sampling described  here~~ be an inventory of distribution of spray on range  forage.  1. Pre-Spray: Fifteen sampling sites for each of five selected  forage species will be selected on areas where one pound DDT  per acre is anticipated to be applied. Each site will be assigned  a number and plotted on an aerial mosaic. To facilitate ready  field recognition all sites will be flagged or painted. Selected  forage species will be tagged or marked at each site. Collections  will be made of each of five selected forage species at each  site and each bagged separately and put in cold storage. - Forest  Service, Idaho Fish & Game, and Fish & Wildlife Service.  2. Spraying: Five oil sensitive cards will be placed out on each  sample site just before the sites are to be sprayed. Within 24  hours after spraying the cards will be picked up and evaluat~d  for the amounts of spray hitting the cards. Averages will be  computed for the cards at each site. The highest ten sites for  each species will be selected for further sampling. (The highest  10 must average over .1 pound DDT per acre on the ground. Other­wise  only those sites having .1 pound per acre will be selected  for further sampling.) Pre-spray vegetation samples collected  from sites not chosen for further sampling will t hen be discarded.  Forest Service.  3• Post-Spray Sampling: Samples will be taken for each of the five  marked species from sites selected for further study at periods  from immediately following spraying and at 30-day intervals for  a total of four post-spray collection periods. Each individual  species from all sampling sites w~ll be put together as a single  sample for each period of collection. All ~mples will be  properly labeled and frozen~ - Forest Service.  4. For control the same five species will be selected on sites well  away from the spray project. Samples will be taken of each  species at each time samples are taken from within the spray  area. Each species will be kept separate for analyses. -  Forest Service.  5  ..  6  G. Preservation and Shipment of Samples  1. The Agricultural Research Service will furnish the project with  containers for fat and tissue samples. Containers and instructions  for samples to be taken from the hunts in Boise and Elmore counties  will be forwarded to Dick Norell, Idaho Fish & Game Department  Biologist, Boise, Idaho. Plastic bags will be furnished by the  Forest ·service for rumen and vegetation samples. All tagging  materials will be furnished by the Forest Service.  2. Adipose fat samples taken from deer during the pre-spray and  post-spray collection periods will be sent to Agricultural  Research Service in Yakima, Washington for analyses immediately  following collection of the full complement (up to 15 samples)  of animals. This material will be analyzed at the earliest possible  date. The Agricultural Research Service will send a report o~ their  findings to the Regional Forester, U. s. Forest Service, Ogden,  . Utah, as soon as analyses are completed and a copy to the Director,  Idaho Fish and Game Department, Boise, Idaho. The contents of  this analyses report will be considered administratively confiden­tial.  Information about these results will not be released as  public information unless and until agreed upon jointly by the  Forest Service and Idaho Fish and Game Department.  3• All collections made through the 1964 hunting season will be  held in a cold storage locker in Salmon rented by the Forest  Service for that purpose, except that those fat samples taken  from the hunt in Boise and Elmore counties will be shipped by  the Idaho Fish & Game Department directly to the Agricultural  Research Service. Following each major collection period in  1964 in the Salmon area, the Forest Service will ship samples  to the respective laborat;ries for r~sidue analyses.  4. Robin samples will be shipped as two component parts--carcass,  and crop with the stomach. Analysis will be made of DDT residues  in each of these two component parts.  5· All fat and robin samples will go ~o :  Analytical I nvestigations  Pesticide Chemicals Research Branch  Agricultural ReseaRch Service -  3706 Nob Hill Boulevard  Yakima, Washington 98902  c/o Mr. Kenneth C. Walker  All vegetation, including rumen, samples will go to:  Bureau of Sport Fisheries & Wildlife  Building 45, Denver Federal Center  Denver, Colorado 80225  c/o Mr. Richard E. Pillmore  Disposition of deer taken as pre-spray samp~ing will be by the  Idaho Fish & Game Department. Disposition of post-spray samples  will be 'worked out at a later date.  IV. Cygon Test Area.  A. Treatment area will be in the South Fork of Iron Creek about 30 miles  south of Salmon, Idaho.  B. A memorandum has been sent out by the Project Leader to all project  personnel indicating that anyone working in this test area should  be watchful for active bird nests. If any are found, locations are  to be marked and reported to the Monitor Coordinator.  c. Personnel of the Forest Service and Bureau of Sport Fisheries and  Wildlife will make a search of the area just preceding spray appli-cation  for active bird nests. ·  D. The Research Biologist of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife  will continue followup study of active nests found. A check of hatch  and survival will be made.  7  E. These same personnel will investigate the possibilities of establishing  bird census routes through both the treatment area and the control area.  If this proves feasible, routes will be established and described.  Sunrise counts will be made within three days prior to spraying and  again within three days following spraying. All birds along the route .  will be identified, if possible, and recorded. This will not constitute  a thorough population dynamics investigation of the ar;;:s bUt' may  F.  serve as an indication of trends.  .. . If any birds are found that are JUst freshly dead, either from the  active nests or in connecti on with the census routes, they will be  analysed for cholinesterase l evel s by the Research Biologist of the  Fish & Wildlife Service.  V. Reporting.  A. The close of the 1964 bi g game hunting season will be considered the  close of this project monitoring field period. Collections made in  1965 and 1966 will be as programmed between the Idaho Fish & Game  Department and the Agricultural.Research Service: A copy of analyses  results for animals taken from within the project area after 1964  should be furnished the·Regional Forester, Forest Ser?ice, Ogden,  Utah.  . ..  .. ;  - .  B. The Agricultural Research Service will fur~sh the Regional  Forester, u. s. Forest Service, Ogden, Utah, with a report of  findings of the sample analyses. The Forest Service will furnish  copies to the Director, Idaho Fish & Game Department, Boise, Idaho,  the Area Big Game Biologist, Idaho Fish & Game Department, Salmon,  Idaho and to the Director, Fish & Wildlife Research Center, Denver,  Colorado.  C. The Denver Wildlife Research Center will furnish the Regional  Forester, U. s. Forest Service, Ogden, Utah, with a report  covering sample analyses and findings of the Cygon test. The  Forest Service will furnish copies to the Director, Idaho Fish  & Game Department, Boise, Idaho, the Area Big Game Biologist,  Idaho Fish & Game Department, Salmon, Idaho, and the Agricultural  Research Service, Yakima, Washington.  D. At the end of his assignment to this project the Project Game  Biologist will furnish a r eport of his field accomplishments to  the Monitor Coordinator.  E. A completion report of all monitoring activities will be made 9y  the Monitor Coordinator to the Project Leader by November 15, 1964.  This report will include an analysis of the terrestrial wildlife  monitoring. Copies of the approved report will be supplied to all  cooperating agencies by the Regional Forester.  F. The following report will be used as an additional source of big  game pre-spray control data: ""Report of the Determination of  DDT, DDE, and TDE Insecticide Residues in the Adipose Tissue of  Antelope, Bear, Deer, Elk, Goat, and Moose in the State of Idaho"",  by Agricultural Research Service in cooperation with the Idaho  Fish and Game Department, AugUst, 1963 •  •  8",,,,2015-08-25,2015-08-25,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/122,122,176.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/176.pdf,forestryresearch122

Casebeer  Monitor Coordinator  February 1965  FORE;WORD  This ia a preliminary summarization of information available to date cover­ing  the intensive monitoring program carried on in conjunction with the  1964 Spruce Budworm Control Project on the Salmon National Forest. The  monitoring program was aimed at investigating effects on many elements of  the forest environment all of which will be fully documented when the many  evaluations are completed. The large number of samples taken overloaded  available laboratory facilities, consequently, some analyses are still to  be done. This account is an interim progress report of work completed to  date with no attempt to draw conclusions. Most of the remainder of the work  will be finished within the next few months. A final report on the short­range  program will be prepared at that time. Results of the long-term  monitoring will be reported at a later date, possibly a year to two years  hence.  INTRODUCTION  A spruce budworm infestation within the Salmon and Challis National Forests,  spreading and intensifying since 1958, increased to one and one-half mil­lion  acres by 1963. In July 1964, approximately 525,000 acres of the in­festation  were sprayed with DDT. Tributary drainages of the Salmon River  from Horse Creek upstream to Carmen Creek below the town of Salmon, Idaho,  were sprayed by helicopters (about ten percent of the area comprising the  more sensitive portions) and fixed-wing planes.  PLANNED PROTECTION  Provisions were made for the control of spray materials in order to protect  other forest resources. Observers were assigned in additional fixed-wing  planes and helicopters to help guide spray pilots and to check on the proper  control and application of spray materials. Pilots and observers were  briefed daily and given orientation flights to acquaint them with terrain,  protection measures, and flight patterns for their respectively assigned  spray blocks. Spraying was terminated when weather conditions exceeded  those established as safe maximums for control of insecticide. Homesteads,  pastures, irrigation ditches, reservoirs, streams, nontimber types over 160  acres, and noninfested timber types were designated as nonspray zones.  ) , 2  MONITORING  Controls  Intensive monitoring was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the con­trols  and some of the possible impacts of spraying on other components of  the forest environment. Trained wildlife personnel of the Forest Service  were detailed to the project to conduct monitoring. Assistance was provided  by other Federal agencies such as the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wild­life,  the Agricultural Research Service; and by Idaho State agencies--the  Department of Fish and Game, the Department of Agriculture, and the  Department of Health.  Chinook and sockeye salmon, as well as steelhead trout, are reared or  migrate through streams within the project area. The importance of the  sport and commercial fisheries of these anadromous species as well as the  resident rainbow and cutthroat trout populations, necessitated adopting  stringent measures for stream protection. Nonspray zones were established  on each side of streams flowing five cubic feet per second or more. Re­duced  dosages of DDT were sprayed by helicopter in strips immediately  adjacent to the nonspray zones. Beyond that, fixed-wing planes were used  to apply one pound of DDT per acre.  Evaluation of Controls  The effectiveness of controls for keeping DDT out of the streams was evalu­ated  by determining changes in numbers of drifting aquatic insects during  and after spraying, and by laying out transects of oil-sensitive dye-cards  to measure spray distribution. As a result of these evaluations, nonspray  zones were widened twice during the operations of the project and fixed­wing  application was moved back from the streams to twice the distance  originally determined to offer the required degree of protection.  Aquatic Monitoring ..  Fish in live-boxes  Chinook salmon and rainbow trout were held in live-boxes in streams within  the project area and fish in control boxes were placed in streams outside.  Acute mortality of fish at most test sites was no higher than mortality in  the control boxes. Where mortality of test fish was higher, analyses of  fish carcasses for DDT residues are being made. When completed, these ana­lyses  may shed some light on the cause of loss.  Wild Fish  Wild fish were taken by use of an electric shocker before and after spraying.  These are being analyzed for DDT residues but results are not yet available.  Aquatic Insects  Increases in drifting aquatic insects were recorded in many instances im­mediately  after spraying. Bottom insect sampling was carried on at a number  3  of stations before and for up to three months following spraying and in areas  where numbers of insects in drift samples increased the most immediately  after spraying, little re-building of bottom insect populations occurred  during the three months following spraying. Most other stations, however,  showed increases in numbers of bottom insects by fall. Some changes in the  composition of sampled insects were recorded. Insects of the orders  Trichoptera (Caddis flies) and Ephemeroptera (May flies) made up a smaller  percentage in the fall samples compared to the samples collected before and  just after spraying. Seasonal fluctuations in aquatic insect numbers and  composition are normal. However, previous measurements for the sample  streams are lacking, thus it is impossible to know what part of the measured  changes may be natural and what may be due to repopulation stimulated in  some manner O;f spray materia!s in the streams.  Aquatic Vegetation  Aquatic vegetation was sampled before and after spraying. Results from  residue analyses of these samples are not yet available.  Water  Water samples were taken to help determine possible correlations between  aquatic insect losses and DDT in streams. Residue analyses were determined  to a minimum detectable level of 0.2 part per billion. Even though only  two samples indicated levels greater than one part per million, smaller  amounts could in some cases be correlated with increases of aquatic insect  losses, but not in all. Water samples taken continuously for periods of an  hour or more seemed to provide better evaluations of DDT in the stream  than did periodic dip samples.  Hughes Creek Special Study  A special study was conducted on the Hughes Creek drainage where spray appli­cation  patterns differed from those on the main project. Samples of wild  fish, aquatic vegetation, drifting aquatic insects, stream bottom populations  of aquatic insects, and water were taken. Live-boxes containing test fish  were also used. Idaho Fish and Game Department personnel conducted this  study and are preparing a report which will be included in the full moni­toring  report to be published later.  Long-Range Study  The Game Department is also conducting a study on some long-range impacts of  DDT on aquatic insects and fish. This will extend into 1965 and will be the  subject of a separate report when completed.  Terrestrial Monitoring  Big-Game Adipose Tissues  Evaluations of terrestrial wildlife and habitat dealt primarily with levels  of DDT residues. Mule deer were sampled before the project started and  4  mule deer, elk, and mountain goats were sampled in both the project and vari­ous  control areas after. spraying was completed. Residue levels in adipose  ti~sues of prespray samples of deer ranged from .01 to .033 parts million of  DDT and DDT~etabolites. Samples of adipose tissue from mule deer taken  one month after spraying ranged from 9.6 to 48.14 parts per million. Re­sults  have not been received for analyses of samples taken during the 1964  hunting season. Additional samples of deer adipose tissues will be taken  during the hunting seasons of 1965 and 1966.  Rumen Samples ( /~.,- &lt;;rohJA.::~)  Prespray rumen content samples from deer contained no detectable DDT resi­dues.  Samples taken one month after spraying ranged in content from 27.0  to 185.3 parts per million. other tissues of deer were sampled also but  residue analyses of these have not been completed.  Birds  Robins and blue grouse were taken for residue analyses. Laboratory analyses  are not yet completed  Terrestrial Vegetation  Ten species of vegetation were sampled and ar~ being analyzed for DDT resi­due  levels. Analyses of four species have been completed. Prespray and  control samples show no detectable levels. Immediate postspray samples  showed DDT residue levels of 148 parts per million for sagebrush, 313 for  balsamroot, 384 for wheatgrass, and 79 for Douglas-fir. In the three  months following spraying residue levels decreased by about 50 percent for  all four species. Results of analyses of the other species will be avail­able  later.  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS  Cream  Cream from producers living both inside and outside the project area was  sampled before and periodically after spraying. Analyses indicated all to  be negative for DDT and DDT-metabolites at detectable levels of one part  per billion or more.  Milk  Grade A milk samples were obtained from producers living both near the pro­ject  area and well away from it, before and after spraying. These also  tested negative for DDT residues.  Beef  A plan to obtain adipose tissue samples from beef cattle which had grazed  within the project area was not successful. Up to the time of this writing  no cattle from the project area were reported processed through the Salmon  slaughterhouse.  I  5  CULINARY WATER  Culinary water samples from sources utilized by the communities of Gibbons­ville,  Cobalt, and Forney were tested before and after spraying. Analyses  showed all negative for DDT residues at detectable levels of one part per  billion.  SPECIAL MONITORING TASKS  A large fixed-wing spray plane partly loaded with between 350 and 700 gallons  of insecticide crashlanded attempting to return to base. The pilot jetti­soned  the load over the project area. When the jettison site was found two  days later, it was obvious that a portion of the insecticide had been  dropped across a small tributary of Panther Creek. Water samples had been  taken in Panther Creek the day of the crash and again the day the jettison  site was found. These tested negative for DDT. Bottom aquatic insects,  wild fish, and aquatic vegetation were also sampled. Residue analyses are  not completed so the impact of this jettisoned load on the stream cannot  be fully evaluated at this time.  A TBM spr~ plane which crashed with almost a full load of 700 gallons of  insecticide was found upon investigation to have landed in thick timber a  considerable distance from water.",,,,2015-08-25,2015-08-25,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/125,125,179.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/179.pdf,forestryresearch125

Cont ingent upon results of 196:3 tests.  BENEFITS FROM THE CONTROL of the infestation are manifold:  *Forest esthetic values, wildlife habitat, and controlled us­able  water flow are all preserved.  *Timber values impor tant to local communities and econo­mies  are protected. Fut ure fo rests are saved by protecting  small trees.  *The a llowable timber harvest from the protected working  circles is not reduced because of loss from insect depreda­tion.  *A costly crash salvage program yielding degraded logs is  avoided.  * Forest fire hazards are reduced through the preservation of  living trees. A dead forest presents a tremendous fire hazard.  FAaS ABOUT THE CONTROL OPERATION  OBJECTIVES:  I. Reduce in fes ta ti on to the lowest possible level consis t ent  with public safety, high economy, good multiple use ma nage­ment,  and the highest d egree of protection to fish and wild­life  resources.  II. Keep H ) ublic, especially the people most inter ) d and  concerntu, fully informed as to the importa nt planumg, ex­ecution,  and completion phases of t he project.  Ill. Work closely with cooperators and in terested individua ls  and organizations.  IV. T est promising new control methods. Screen new, safer  pesticides and biological suppression agents.  V. No lost-time a ccidents, no forest fires, no loss of wildlife, no  damage to equipment.  DURATION: On selected days during t he period from late .June  to early Augus t, 1963, flights over the infest ed timber will occur  between 4:00 AM and about 10:00 AM on suitable fl ying days.  T otal flying time to complete the project is estimated at about  twenty days. Work in 1964 will be based on the status of the in­sect  at t hat time and on a ny new and a pproved con t rol pro­cedures  available.  SPRAYING PLAN: The cri t ically infes ted t imberlands are divi­ded  into Area 1 to be flown from the Dubois airport and  Area 2 (a 16,000 acre test area ) to be flown from the Salmon a ir­port.  Spray coverage will be govern ed by specific practices and  pa tterns devised for each area individually to provide the great­est  possible protection to salmon-spawning streams and t rout  waters and still obtain adequate control of the tree killers. The  State Fish and Game Departmen t and the Forest Rangers co­operated  to select cri t ical s treams, r ivers, lakes, and reservoirs.  Except for test areas where spraying is designated for specific  testing to improve applica t ion techniques, the following procedure  will be followed:  1. West Camas Creek, and Howard Creek, Targhee Na­tional  Forest:  a. No spray a pplication within 114 mile of the stream.  b. The next % mile use DDT at the rate of ~ pound per  acre applied by fixed-wing aircraft.  c. Remainder of infested area t reated at rate of one  pound of DDT per acre using fixed-wing aircraft.  2. Remainder of Infestation:  a. No spray within 100 feet of designated streams or  bodies of water.  b. From 100 feet to 400 feet away from water apply ~  pound of DDT per acre by helicopter.  c. From 400 feet to 1000 feet away from water apply ~  pound DDT per acre by fixed-wing aircraft.  d. Remainder of area beginning 1000 feet from water  apply DDT at rate of one pound per acre.  3. T est Areas*  a. No.1-10,000 acres, T arghee National Forest, test feasi­bility  of Sevin as a pesticide against spruce budworm.  b. No. 2- 16,000 acres, Salmon Nationa l Forest test for  maximum protection to salmon-spawning areas.

Th pst critical infestations now extend ove1 1),000 acres  on the 1 atghee and Salmon National Forests. The to~hetic, wild­life,  and watershed values to be preserved cannot be measured  in dollars and cents. These values assume pa rticular importance  on such popular forest recreation and public fishing and hunting  grounds as are located on t hese two Na tiona l Forests. The  Henry's Lake-Island Park area on t he T arghee National Forest  a nd t he Salmon River drainage of t he Salmon National Forest  are both of Nationwide interest. The volume of timber in da nger  of destruction is 5.3 billion board feet; equal to the lumber in  750,000 houses.  WILDLIFE PROTEaiON: Past experience has shown t hat serious  damage to fish, birds, wild or d omestic animals, is u nlikely as a  result of spraying with t he concentration and application rates  used on th is project. All extra precautions, inclu ding modified  flight plans to exclude salmon-spawning grounds a nd other criti­cal  streams, are taken to prevent damage. Helicopters are being  used on about 20 percent of t he a rea adjacent to lakes and  streams for spot control. No spraying is done when air movement  will cause appreciable drift. The advice of fish and wildlife  specialists is being rigidly followed. Tight operational control and  supervision will insure t hat all instructions and precautions are  carried out.  PUBLIC PRECAUTIONS: A forest fire in the control a reas could  hamper completion of the job and destroy the timber we are  st riving to protect. Please observe signs, prevent fires, and adhere  to the precautionary measures necessary for protecting yourself  and your resources.

(Photo  IEP-110)  February 1967  ZECTRAN - for Control of Spruce Budworm  Only a small fraction of the pes­ticides  used in the United States  are applied to forest l ands. Yet  forests are an especially important  part of the total environment. They  are the source of major water sup­plies  and home for most of our wild­life.  The application of pesticides  to forest lands must be done with  great care, and with as little ef­fect  as possible on other insects,  fish, birds, and other animals.  Pesticides provide a quick, ef­fective  and economical means of sup­pressing  outbreaks of many insects .  Sometimes they are the only known  means of control. But pesticides  also pose the problem of environ­mental  contamination.  There is no question that small  amounts of some insecticides such  as DDT, get in the soil, water, or  on plants, and because of their per­sistence  remain for a relatively  l ong time. Some ultimate ly finds  its way into animal tissues . DDT,  in minute amounts, is almost univer­sally  present in the fatty tissues  of mammals, including man. DDT's  persistence, its ability to accumu­late  in animal fat, and its wide  range of activity against many in­sect  species, are the main arguments  against widespread use of this other­wise  safe and very effective insec­ticide.  Today, many people are concerned  about pesticide residues; some would  ban use of DDT and other per sist ent  chemicals. But until substitutes  are found, careful use of DDT is  far better than a dead forest. In  the meantime, foresters are seeking  new, safer, more effective sprays .  Forest Service - U . S. Depar t ment of Agriculture  Insectic ide Evaluation Research  In 1964, a research program in  Insecticide Evaluation was begun at  the U.S. Forest Service Experiment  Station in Berkeley, California.  Its goal, under the direction of  Dr. Arthur D. Moore, is to develop  safer chemical treatments for con­trol  of forest insects. Moore's  staff now totals 30, and includes  the special skills of entomologists,  chemists, a plant physiologist, an  insect biochemist, a statistician­programer,  an ecologist, and a me­teorologist,  plus laboratory tech­nicians  and other specialists.  Working closely with the insec­ticide  group on related research  are 17 post doctorate fellows,  research assistants, and graduate  students under the direction of  Dr. John E. Casida, a professor of  Entomology at the University of  California, Berkeley. Casida's  group does basic laboratory research  on pathways of metabolism and break­down  of chemicals in plants and  animals.  The research team was joined in  1966 by Dr. Julius Hyman, a noted  chemist responsible for develop­ment  of several widely used agri­cultural  insecticides . Some For­est  Service scientists, and the Uni­versity  of California group share  facilities at Hyman's laboratory  in Berkeley.  The Research Goal  The research goal is to develop  and help get into use, safe and  short - lived chemical treatments for  use against forest pests. A nation­al  steering committee sets priori­ties  . The number one job now is to  develop new treatments for use  against tree defoliators previously  controlled by aerial applications  of DDT. On the list are the spruce  -2-  budworm, hemlock looper, pandora moth,  and the Douglas-fir tussock moth. All  pose serious threats to North American  forests.  Target Number One  Target number one is the spruce  budworm, the most widely distributed  and destructive forest tree defolia­tor  in North America. More aggres ­sive  than its name implies, the bud­worm  attacks spruce, Douglas-fir, and  true firs. It was first recognized  as a serious forest pest in the Wes ­tern  United States in 1922, when two  outbreaks occurred in Idaho. Wide­spread  epidemics have since been  recorded in many forests in the Rocky  Mountains and in the Pacific North­west.  Since 1944, epidemics have  occurred in Idaho, Montana, Oregon,  New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado.  Finding New Insecti c ides  In looking for new insecticide  treatments, scientists seek chemicals  that will be (1) effective, (2) sel­ective,  and (3) non-persistent .  Treatments should kill the target  insect, but not other organisms . Chem­icals  should break down as soon as  they do the job, and not linger weeks  or months after spraying or ""build-up""  in plants and animals.  The first step in research is a  process called ""screening,"" in which  carefully selected chemicals are  tested in the laboratory. Early  tests turned up several insecticides  that were effective against spruce  budworm . One carbamate--Zectran-­was  especially promising . Zectran,  .chemically 4-dimethyl-amino- 3,5-  xylyl methyl-carbamate, is a product  of the Dow Chemical Company. It has  been used against snails and insects  on ornamental plants.  Why Zectran?  In laboratory tests, Zectran show­ed  many of the characteristics sought  in the basic chemical. It is more  toxic to spruce budworm than DDT,  especially in the sixth larval in­star  (that stage of insect develop­ment  when the larva is nearing pupa­tion).  Though Zectran does not have the  total degree of selectivity research­ers  hope to develop, it is more  toxic to budworm and some other de­foliators  than to most other organ­isms.  Zectran is especially safe to  fish. It is one of the least toxic  chemicals tested on game fish by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at  their Fish Pesticide Laboratory in  Denver.  Because of its high toxicity to  budworm, it can be applied in small  amounts not hazardous to other forms  of life.  Zectran is also nonpersistent ; it  breaks down in sunlight within a f ew  hours and is rapidly degraded by  biological systems.  Fi e ld Tests  The first step in fi eld t esting  was to find out if Zectran would  last long enough in forest spraying  to kill the budworm. A field t est  near Salmon, Idaho, in 1~64, indica­ted  that it probably would--but not  in the formulation tested .  In 1965, Zectran was used again  near Darby, Montana, in a new t ype  of formulation. It was highly effec­tive,  achieving a 98 percent r educ ­tion  in budworm populations in one  area. No adverse ef f ect s wer e found  on fish, birds , or mamma l s and no  l asting effects on benefi ci al insect  populations were reported.  -3-  ABOVE: I n t he l abora tory, the t ox i c ity  of chemi ca l s i s tes t ed on spruce bud ­wo  rm l a rvae.

( Photo IEP- 114)  In 1966, tests were conducted in  the Bitterroot National Forest in  Montana and the Salmon National For­est  in Idaho. The purpose was to  test its effectiveness against the  budworm and to study the effects of  the insecticide on other insects,  fish and mammals. For this work,  Station scientists called in other  specialists--the U.S. Fish and Wild­life  Service, the Montana Fish and  Game Department, and the U.S . Bureau  of Sport Fisheries working with the  University of Idaho.  In Montana, the U.S . Fish and  Wildlife Service studied the effects  on small mammals, fish and aquatic  insects. Biologists trapped and  marked squirrels, mice, chipmunks,  and songbirds, and kept records of  wildlife behavior, both before and  after spraying .  In a 200-acre plot sprayed with  five times the dosage applied else­where,  Montana State biologists are  studying the effects of the insec­ticide  on blue grouse. They used  tiny radio transmitters attached to  the birds to follow their movements.  They noted behav1or and checked for  accumulations of Zectran in the  birds' systems. Tests on blue grouse  will continue until spring of 1967 .  In Idaho, fisheries biologists  searched for effects of Zectran on  trout and salmon in Bear Valley Creek,  and on their aquatic insect food  source. No adverse effects have been  reported to date; however, the final  tabulation on aquatic insects has  not been completed.  Results  In the past three years, Zectran  has been intensively tested on for­est  lands. All this work adds up to  an insecticide treatment that is  both effective and safe. Though bud­worm  mortality was high, entomologists  vJ~¥;&gt; -4-  found no adverse effects on wildlife  and little or no reduction of insect  populations other than budworm and  some associated defoliators.  Foliage from sprayed areas was  analyzed to determine its persistence  on plants browsed by deer and elk.  Researchers learned that Zectran de­teriorated  to insignificant levels  within four weeks after spraying.  After eight days, residue on most  plant material was less than one part  per million. (One-hundred parts per  million is generally considered to  be the ""minimum no effect"" level.)  And there is no evidence yet to  indicate that it will persist in  plant and animal systems.  Appl icat ion Tec hn iques  The research team not only screens  and conducts basic research on pro­spective  chemicals, but also studies  application techniques ... spray formu­lations,  timing, equipment, and in­secticide  distribution.  One of the toughest problems has  been to learn where, and in what  quantity, spray is distributed  through the forest. Researchers  first used conventional dye sensi­tive  cards set out to pick up spray  droplets. However, these did not  show where the smallest droplets were  going or how much spray was reaching  the target. For the 1965 and 1966  tests, a new method was devised. Dr.  Chester Himel, a research professor  at the University of Georgia, is pri­marily  responsible. By use of tiny  fluorescent particles mixed in the  spray, he determined the size of the  spray drops that killed individual  budworm.  The largest drop found on a dead  insect was 107 microns in size; most  (97 percent) were below 50 microns  ..  (a micron is 0.000039 inch). But  researchers knew that drops released  from the plane ranged in size from  1-400 microns. Thus the larger drops  were largely ineffective. The for­est  cover and dense webbing surround­i  ng the budworm shielded them from  all but the smallest spray particles.  For future spray work, scientists  will use an ""aerosol"" spray-or a  fine spray mist of very small drop­lets  . New equipment needed for  '·aerosol"" spraying is being developed  at the U.S. Forest Service Equipment  Development and Testing Center in  Missoula, Montana.  Tracking the spray will be in­creasingly  difficult as drops get  smaller . Previous methods aren't  good enough . Scientists have found  that lidar . .. a marriage of radar and  laser developed by Stanford Research  Institute, can keep track of even  the smallest drops . The lidar shoots  a laser beam into the spray cloud and  the reflected beam is measured on an  oscilloscope and recorded by camera.  Two lidar guns tested by SRI and the  Forest Service during the summer of  1966 traced the tiny droplets as  long as 15- 20 minutes after spraying .  Knowledge obtained from these  tests will be used to help direct  spray to target areas by natural air  movement.  Field Tests 1967  By the end of the 1966 field sea­son,  the insecticide research team  felt they had learned enough about  Zectran to warrant a full operational  ~test . This will be done in the sum­~  mer of 1967 on some 60,000 acres in  the Sawtooth National Forest, Idaho .  The test will be done along the South  Fork of the Boise River and tributar­ies  in an area infested with spruce  budworm since 1952.  -5-  ABOVE: Cooperative tests have turned up  no adverse effects on fish or wildlife  from use of Zectran. There has also been  little or no reduction of insect popula­tions  other than budworm and some assoc­i  ated defoliators. (Photo IEP-111)  BELOW: Lidar gun--a marriage of radar  and laser--is used to track smal l spray  particles.  •  •  •  •  The goal of 1967 tests will be to:  Test the effectiveness of Zectran  applied in an aerosol spray at  the rate of one half ounce per  acre.  Determine to what extent this  type of treatment reduces environ­mental  contamination.  Determine the most effective means  of applying low volume, micro-size  droplets, by using atmospheric  transport and diffusion in spray  operations.  Test mechanical air samplers for  checking spray distribution.  The test will be carried out by  U.S. Forest Service personnel from  the Regional Office in Ogden, Utah,  and the Sawtooth National Forest,  Twin Falls, Idaho, under technical  guidance of the Insecticide Evalua­tion  group and with assist ance from  the U.S. Fish and Wildl ife Service  and other cooperators .  Alternati ves to Use of Insect ic ides  The forest is a complex community.  Disruption of its natural. patterns  must be undertaken only after thorough  study of alternatives and their con­sequences  . The use of insecticides  is only one approach to forest insect  control. There are several others .  Sometimes a strategic harvest of tim­ber  can halt the spread of epidemics.  Where this is not possible, a con­trolled  application of insecticides  may be necessary . Someday, research  may give us methods for natural con­trol  by predators, by use of sex  attractants, or other biological  methods. The goal is a wide range  of choices from which the land man­ager  can select those that best suit  his purpose . Most important is con­trol  in the safest possible manner,  and with consideration for other  forest resources.  -6-  Resea rch Coope rators  Dr. John Casida  University of California  Dow Chemical Company  Environmental Science Services  Administration  Dr. C.

General  The Douglas-fir cone crop was light to moderate in Oregon and  Washington; a few cones were collected and processed ,in some areas (Johnson).  In British Columbia the cone crop was very light on Douglas-fir  and White spruce, and heavy on ponderosa pine (Redlin). It appears that  the 1966 crop on Douglas-fir will be good {Johnson, Redlin).  In Idaho work on western white pine is completed and DouglasÂ­fir  is presently receiving attention(Sohenk).  In California the cone crop on ponderosa pine was light to medium  {Koerber).  2. Damage  In Washinton and Oregon, in general Douglas-fir suffered less  - damage than usual. .Q.. oregonensis was high,. ]. colfaxiana low, and MÂ·  spermotrophus increased in rrumbers for the second year, destroying up to  20 per cent of the seed {Johnson). In British Columbia the situation was  similar (Redlin).  l/ Compiled from information submitted by workers conducting research on  cone and seed insects. Not to be published without the consent of the  contributor. Assembled by A.F. Redlin, Forest Research Laboratory,  Victoria, B. C.  - 2 -  In Idaho, Eu~osma rescissoriana accounted for 81 and 96 per cent  of the White pine seed losses in 1963 and 1964g or when expressed as a  ~oportion of total seed 12 and 0.5 per cent respectively. Dioryctria  abietellag Conopththorus monticolae and a cecidomyiid, possibly Rnbsaamenia  !eeni were relatively unimportant. A highly significant relationship was  shown between damage on longitudinal cone sections and total counts in white  pine cones. Highly significant differences in seed losses were found between  9 r 9, 20 x 20, and 30 x 30 foot tree spacings, with losses increasing with  deereasing density. Losses in mixed natural stands were comparable to those  in 9 x 9 foot spacing (Schenk).  In California, damage to ponderosa pine seed ranged from moderate  to severe with Conophthorus ponderosae and Laspeyresia spp. causing nearly  all the damageo Conophthorus damage amounted to less than 25% of the crop  but on some trees as high as 85% of the cones were infested. Laspeyresia  larvae in cones after beetle attack reduced seed yields 14~ (Koerber).  !~British Columbia damage to ponderosa pine, due almost entirely to  Laspeyresia piperana, ranged from light to severe. Up to 4 ""'!1:, of the seed  was destroyed. Conophthorus did not occur in any cones examined (Redlin).  J. Biological studies  In northern Idahog biologies of four important parasites of the  white pine cone moth, Eucosma rescissoriana were studied from 1961 to 1965.  Pimplopterus n. ap. Ichneumonidae), Chelonus petrovae McComb, Apanteles  starki Mason (Braconidae) and Psalidopteryx psiloaorsiphaga Brooks (Tachinidae)  a~counted for about 95% of the parasitism of the cone moth. Bracon rhYacionicae  (Mues.) occurred locally in small numbers. Rate of parasitism increased frO!Il  9.4% to 40.9% in one plot d~ring the three years of observation (Goyer).  - 3 -  A c one bagginr experiment conduct ed on ponderosa pine near  Placerville9 California at 3 p500 feet elevation showed the oviposition  period of Laspeyresia sppo extended from April 9 to May 18 in 1965.  The adult emergence period coincided with this. Dissection of beetleÂ­damaged  cones showed that successful broods of Conophthorus were established  in about 5~ of the abort ed cones . The largest brood produced 11 beetles,  while most had one t o three per cone (Koerber) o  At Lytton9 B. Co hatching of Laspeyresia Eiperana on ponderosa  pine cones occurred in late May and early June, 1965o Larvae passed  through five instars feeding almost entirely on seeds, migr ating into  the cone axis in late July to overwinter in the fifth l~rval instar (Hedlin).  4o Chemical Control  Bior i ng dimeÂ·thoa t e and Meta-Systox-R were applied with a mist~  blower f rom a truck~ ounted ladder at Oo5 and loO per cent concentrations  to Dougla s ~fir cones whi ch had just turned downo Good control of the cone  midge Contari nia oregonensis and cone moths was obtained when materials  .were applied to run-off o The study was conducted by Weyerhaeuser Company  and the UoS. Forest Service at Corvallis, Oregon, and Centralia and Elma,  Washington (Johnson)o Small- scale studies with Bidrin, dimethoate, Azodrin  and Meta~ystox-R indicate that l o O~ concentration is optimum for killing  ~Â· oregonensis in Dougl a s-fir cones. Higher concentrations may be phytotoxic.  Translocation from foliage into the cone is good, but at low concentrations  materials do not translocete well from one side of the cone ~o the other,  from the tip to the base or vice versa, or from the cone into the foliage  (Johnson)o Radioactive dimethoate was injected into small cone-bearing  trees and the r ate of translocation and distribution of the material  determinedo This study is not completed and indicates the need for further  - 4 -  work on translocation of systemics (Johnson).  A lO~acre Douglas-fir seed production area was sprayed b1  helicopter in 1965 for control of ~Â· oregonensis . Data are not fully  ana~zed but indications are t~at control is good in upper one-third of  tree crowns (Meso).  Trunk implantation of met hyl demeton in Douglas-fir (9 - 15""  dbh) at 1 gm. per diameter inch by means of ""Mauget Tree Injector Units""  failed to produce consistent significant reductions of seed loss in all  strcollections made in 1965. It is speculated that one or more of the  following events influenced the results: (a) unequal and light intestations  in the replicates; (b) loss of cones to squirrels; (e) the absence of  sufficient cone producing Douglas-fir throughout the region, which forced  carrying out the study in a less than favorable situation; and (q) the  possible breakdown and dissipation of the small amount of toxin.  Significant mortality and reduced seed losses by~Â· colfaxiana were  obtained in a few collections where sufficient data were available for  analysis. Studies on the effects of the insecticide on test rodents fed  t~ated seeds, and on phytotoxicity are in progress (Schenk).  In California a small-scale spray test was conducted using DDT  diazinon, Zectran, and Gut~ion at 1.0( of concentration to individual  cone clusters near the end of the oviposition period of Laspeyresia.  Cone examinations are not complete but it appears that protection against  Laspeyresia is not sufficient. Guthion and Zectran apparently gave effective  protection against Conophthorus (Koerber).  5. Work Currently in Progress  Johnson and Redlin are writing a guide for control of Douglas-fir  ~one and seed insects. They are also working on the description of a species  of midge in Douglas-fir cones.  Schenk is working on insects infesting Douglas-fir.  Redlin r eared ~ Â· colfaxiana larvae at 10 hr. and 16 hr. daylengths  m:rl 6 0 0a nd 75 0 F. temperatures. This is an attempt to obtain information  on factors affecting diapause in cone insects. The study is not completed.  Werner bas started a study to determine the uptake, translocation  and deposition of systemic insecticides for the control of cone and seed  insects in loblolly pine.  6. Work Plannru\  Johnson may do some project scale spraying of Douglas-fir cones  in 1966.  Schenk plans further investigations into biologies of oone and  seed' insects in Douglas~fir followed by those in ponderosa pine. Also  plans to study sampling in an attempt to relate cone crops and insect  populations.  Meso plans field testing of dimethoate and Meta-systox~ in  196e to establish a cost base for application with helicopter and  hydraulic equipment.  Redlin plans to continue temperature-daylength studles in an  attempt to obtain further information on factors affecting diapause.  Studies on white spruce cone insects are planned.  - 6 -  7.

General  The Department of Entomology, University of Arkansas, initiated  a long term study on the insects affecting seed production of loblolly and  shortleaf pines in 1966. The (Jtudy will consist of the three phases survey,  biology, and control. Arthropods other than insects will also be conÂ­sidered.  Preliminary observations indicate that Diorrctria cJerioftlis,  Q. swtella and Q. &lt;Usclusa are the most important pest species. Yearian) â€¢  Douglas-fir cone crops were ,generally abundant in Oregon and  Washington in 1966. Local late frost reduced cone yield on scattered seed  production areas in Oregon and in a seed orchard in Washington. Spring  sampling indicated that midge and cone moth populations would be light  relative to the abundant cones. (Meso).  We bad one of the best cone crops in history; probably even  better than in 1959. Some cones had sectional counts of l4 or more filled  seed. (Johnson).  The Douglas-fir cone crQp in British Columbia was excellent on  the Coast and in Int erior regions. Frost which occurred in late May on  the coast killed many young cones, some almost pendent. (Redlin).  A new forest insect research project was initiated this year  by the u. s. Forest Service, Southeastern Forest Experiment Station. The  objective of t he new project is' to study all insects which directly or  indirectly affect t he quant ity and quality of seeds produced in southern  seed orchards. The project leader is E. P. Merkel with headquarters at  Olustee, Florida. The project will have southwide responsibilities for  seed orchard insect research. Other project scientists are Carl W. Fatzinger  and Gary L. De Barr at Olustee and Harry o. Yates and Bernard H. Ebel at  Athens, Georgia. (Merkel).  Robert G. Jones. and John W. Dale are PhD. candidates under  direction of John Schenk at Moscow, Idaho. Their theses will be conducted  on cone and seed insect problems.  jJ Compiled by A. F. Redlin from information submitted by workers conducting  research on cone and seed insects.

Average losses (% of damaged cones) for the state of Arkansas  in 1966 were:  1st year cones  2nd year cones  Loblolly  10  30  Shortleaf  2  10  Most damage was caused by the three species of Digryc~a with  12Â· glarl,oralis probably the most important. (Yearian â€¢  An extensive cone and seed insect evaluation was carried out  (Washington, Oregon) to determine the impact midges, moths and chalcids  would have on the c~ent seed crop and to find out what damaging insect  species were indigenous to specific seed production areas and orchards.  Twelve seed areas totalling 184 acres, both established and recently  created, we~Â·e sampled. 1-'f.oths, particularly Dtoryctr'.t! l!hi!!~J._)A were  found damaging 19 percent of the cones. Contarinia oregonensis and  Megastigmus JSJ&\Ulotrophg,s each accounted for five percent seed loss (Meso).  The damage caused by ins~ots to the Washington cone crop was low -  probably less than f ive percent . However, in some a2Â·eas i.n Oregon damage  :ran as high as 30 percen-t, :in spite of the large crop. We auticipa:Ge  extr~:~mely he&gt;l'iry dam3.go t here ne&gt;-.. t year. (Johnson) â€¢ .  . Â§l;clM~esr~s d@~.lor,gleaf anC slash pina_s~e.q ... Two suoking  insects have recentl y been discovered causing damage to the seed of longÂ­l  eaf and slam pine in North Fl orida. One is a shield bug, T~~Â·s bipuL.,g,t.ata  (H â€¢ ...S. ) , (HemipÂ·~eL""a: Scutellerio..ae), and the othe:;:o is a l eaf- footed bug,  Leptoglossus corculys (Say), (Hemiptera: Coreidae). The latter species  is very similar to Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidemann, which T. W. Koerber  reported on in 1963. Both species were quite common on the second-year  cones of slash pine in seed orchards and seed production areas at the Olustee  Experiment Forest during August 1966. Adults and late-instar nymphs of both  species have been observed actually feeding on the seed within closed,  nearly mature, second-year cones under field and laboratory conditions.  Although the cone itself usuall.Y exhibits no external damage symptoms, the  shrunken, spongy endosperm of the seed is indicative of damage. More  intensive research on the economic importance of these and similar species  is planned. If it is found that seed damage is significant, researoh will  be expanded to include studies on their biology and control. (De Barr) â€¢  Damage to Douglas-fir in British Columbia was generally light in  Coastal areas. In Interior local! ties damage was high in spite of a large  cone crop, with up to 95 percent of cones being infested by Barbara  ~olfaxiana (Kft.). A good cone crop on white spruce suffered loss to  La.speyresia yowumzw. (Kft.) and Pegohtlemia sp. in addition to the cone  rust C~omyxa PYÂ£Olataâ€¢ A relatively light cone crop on ponderosa pine  was fairly heavily infested by Laspeyresia pipera.IlÂ§ (Kft.). (Hedlin).  -3-  3o Bio.J..o_gj,caJ. St~  Field observations indicate one generation per year for  Dioryctria disclusa and a minimum of three generations per year for  Q. cl&rioralis and Q. amatella. Larval activity of Q. disclusa was  confined to 2nd-year cones in late spring and early SUllUllero Q. aatella  larvae were primarily confined to 2nd-year cones while Q. cla.rioralis  were active in 1st-year cones, 2nd-year cones and terminals as the growing  season progressed. All three species seemed to prefer loblolly pine.  Incomplete data for a small number of Q. clarioralis reared on 1st-year  loblolly cones gave the following information on duration of stages:  Stage  Egg  Larva  Pupa  Adult  l!.q. ~  3 - 5  21- 24  13- 16  10 - 12  (Yearian) o  Bg;C,ba_n ~I:a.xiapa. l arvae were reared on an artificial medium  in the laboratory at temperatures of 15Â°, 17o5Â°, 21Â°, 24Â° and 28Â°0. This  was done in an attempt to determine if diff erent temperatures during larval  d~velcp~ent aff~ct pupal diapausing. Pupae were collected in Â·~he field  from different wide~~separated locations for which weather data ara  available, ~o comparisons can be made between laborato~y- and fieldPrais6d  :Â¥lseotR.. This p.na.se of the study will be completed during the win:tier.  ( HeCIJ..:L'!!; o  lllt."":$lv.i.oleLLii'lt Traps for Study of' Seas~irlty of' Adult  Diozyo1;ria and. LaspenÂ·Â§sia .- A 5-year trapping study was initiated this  year at Olustee, Florida. A ~watt unidirectional U. V. light t~ap ,  patterned after the one described by Barnes, Wargo, and Baldwin in  California Agriculture 19(10) : 6-7, October 1965, has been found to be  very effective in trapping Dioryctria and Laspeyresia moths. The trap is  designed to catch arboreal insects primarily. Total moth catches with  this trap have been much higher than with a 15-watt omnidirectional U. V o  light trap. Daily moth.catch records, by species and sex, are being  obtained throughout the year. It is felt that U. V. light traps might be  a useful technique for determining the species of cone-infesting lepidoptera  and their relative abundance in seed orchards and seed production areas.  {Merkel).  Artificial Diets for Digryctria abietella .-- The artificial diet  developed for Q. abiÂ§tella is being studied for possible long-term  nutritional deficiencies by rearing the insect through successive generaÂ­tions.  To date, three generations have been reared on this diet with an  average of 85-percent survival per generation. The duration of each  generation has been approximately 10 days shorter than when the insect is  reared on pine cones.  -4-  Microorganisms growing on the surface of the artificial diet  have been found to decrease the survival of larvae reared by forming a  physical barrier between them and the diet. These microorganisms are  â€¢ also suspected of producing dietary factors during their own metabolic  activities which interfere with nutrient deletion studies. To eliminate  these interactions, an aseptic method for rearing Q. abie~ella on the  artificial diet has been developed which yields 78-percent survival. The  method is presently being modified to produce a higher survival and will  then be used to determine the nutritional requirements of this insect by  nutrient deletion studies. (Fatzinger) .  EOC!dgnge of Inh8rent ResistÂ§psa to DiijCYQtria and LaBDÂ§Ylesia  Ipfestation in S1ash Pine.-- Cone infestation by Dioryetria abietel1a  and Q. ama.tella were studied on 10 mature slash pines over a 3-year period.  Covariance analysis revealed that some trees experienced either consistently  low or consistently high cone attack from year to year independent of the  total mature cone crop per tree.  St em infestation of young trees by Q. amatella was studied in a  clonal plantation and two progeny tests. J~ge differences in the degree  of infestation occurred among clones or progenies. These observations  suggest that some degree of genetic control exists over cone and stem  attack by Dioryctria spp., but progeny tests are needed to prove thiso  0one infestation data for 1aspgyresia gnarap'ada were also  a.nalyzed for 15 additional slash pines on the Olustee Experimental Forest.  Results obtained over a 3-year period were similar to the Dioryctr]l~ data,  i . e. , consistent year-to-year differences in the resistance or susceptibility  of individual trees to seedvorm infestation. (Merkel).  Taxop,omig StudÂ¥ of the Pupae of the Ganus Diorygtria in the  Southeastern United States.-- This study was completed in cooperation  with Dr. H. H. Neunzig, Department of Entomology, North Carolina State  University, Raleigh. A manuscript has been prepared which gives detailed  descriptions and a key for identifying the pupae of the following species:  12â€¢ z1mmermap.i (Grote), Q. a.matella (Hulst), Q. disglusa Heinrich,  Q. clarioralis (Walker), Q~ pygmaeella Ragonot, and Q. abietella (Do&S.).  In comparing results of the present study with information in  the literature, a difference was found in the number of setae present on  pupae of so-called abietella of Florida and pupae of abietell' (abietivorella)  of the northern United States and Canada. It appears that this apparently  isolated population in the South is not the same species as the more  northern insect. (Merkel).  - 5-  4o Chffl!!i_~BJ, Control  Two limited chemical control projects were carried out this  year. An ~acre Douglas-fir seed production area was treated by helicopter.  A two-percent dimethoate spray was applied at a rate of 10 gallons per acre.  Merchantable Douglas-fir cones must have a minimum of five filled seeds per  out face. Two bushels of these cones will yield one pound of olean seed.  Untreated cones of the helicopter spray site averaged 2.7 seeds per face  while treated cones yielded an average of 6.0 seeds per face. (Meso).  An operational spray program was planned for the Dennie Ahl Seed  Orchard to protect the largest Douglas-fir cone crop since 1962. Twelve  acres of grafted trees were to be sprayed with Bidrin. The wheel-mounted  hydraulic sprayer was modified and fitted with twin vertical booms to spray  trees to a height of 15 feet. Each boom was filled with trip valves so  that one man could operate the tractor and control the spray pattern for  each boom. Because of late frost in June the cone crop was greatly reduced.  Only foux acr es were sprayed with one-half percent Bidrin applied to the  point of foliage runoff. Insect control was very good but trees showed  phytotoxic si gt.Ls . No bud mortality was found. Seed viability tests will  be made to check t he ef fects of Bidrin. (Meso).  A number ol trees were sprayed with Bidrinll Meta...Systox-R and  dirueth~t~ Â·with the expr ess purpose of measuring any adverse effects of  t hose mat.e:da.:;.s o~ f i lled-seed count and germiliat ion. There was no  significant ~eduo~ion in filled-seed count, but germination tests are not  compl eÂ·te. Some .,ones did not open readily and it is hoped this is not  rel ated t o i.'l!lse""Â·iicide treatment. (Johnson).  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~iaÂ·~ On  technical liquid was implanted into large  slash pines (average total ht.: 75 ft.; average d.b.h.: 13 in.) in a  natural slash pine seed production stand at Olustee, Florida. .Mauget tree  injectors were placed every 4""-5n around the tree circumference at breastÂ­height.  Five trees received a dosage of 1.3 ml. Bidrin per inch of tree  diameter at breast-height, five trees were given a 3.1 ml./inch tree diam.  dosage rate, and eleven control trees received no treatment. The treatments  were applied just prior to. the heavy summer attacks period on cones by  DJ.oryetria spp. and about 6 days prior to peak mating and oviposition by  the slash pine seedworm, Laspeyresia anaranjad,a.  The total mature cone crop was collected in mid-September and  numbers of DiortPtria-attaoked cones recorded. When compared with cones  on untreated trees, the low and high Bidrin dosages resulted in an 89=peroent  and 93-peroent reduction in ooneworm attaoksp respectively, at the 5-peroent  probability level. Coneworm attacks on first-year cones were not evaluated.  Percent reduction in seedworm infestation of second-year cones from ?~percent  for the low Bidrin dosage and 99-peroent for the high dosage. (Merkel).  -6-  Qgntrol~ A 5-percent water emulsion of SD 8447 ""Gardona"" was applied  with a John Bean ""Rotomist11 mist blower to 7 40-foot-tall and 6 So-footÂ­tall  slash pines at the rate of 2 gallons per tree. Originally it was  planned to make only a single insecticide application, but due to heavy  rains in May, applications were made on May 5, lJ, and 16 during the peak  oviposition and eclosion period of I,aspeyresia anaranjadaâ€¢ The seedworm  control on the shorter trees was virtually perfect whereas reduction of  seedworm infestation as compared with ll untreated control trees, was  only 84-percent, but nevertheless encouraging. (Merkel).  ,W.dr1,n and SD 2129 Trunk-Jmpl optg:t.J.on Offers Prgmisini Control  ~f Ggnewgrms and Seedworms on Slash Pine Seed OrChard Trees.-- Analysis  of data is still not complete at this writing but SD 9129 (3.2 lb./gal.)  and Bi drin (9 lb./gal.) technical liquid injected into trunks in 3/4"" x 3n  drill holes in 40-foot-tall (12"" d.b.h.) slash pines on January l3 gave  excellent full-season protection of first- and second-year cones from  ~or;tÂ£.ki.Â§. spp. infestation. The Bidrin was applied at the rate of 10 ml.  per i nch of tree diameter at breast-height.  Bidrin was also implanted at the rates of 5- and 10 ml. per  diameter inch on April 29. These treatments also gave very good prot eotion  f':t&gt;cm Dion ct.tlf! spp. through cone harvest in September. A temporary  j""'ellcn:d.ng of needle tips was noted following the heavier Bidrin dosage in  late April. Tests will be conducted this winter to determine wheth&r or  not any of t he systemic treatments had a deleterious effect on seed  viabi lity.  The mid-January .applications of Bidrin and SD 9129, three months  prior to Seedworm infestation, did not control La3peyres1a anaranjadaâ€¢  However, both the 5- and 10 ml. per diameter inch dosages of Bidrin in  l ate April resulted in near perfect control of this seedworm. (Merkel).  Dimetboate Applied b,y Mist Blower Controls Coneyorms and Seedl'{orma  in Slash Pine See&lt;i Orgh.ard- Dimethoate, a relatively safe systemic and  residual-type insecticide, was applied with a John Bean 11Rotomist11 mist  bl ower as follows: 2.5-percent py weight dimethoate water emulsion on  April 5, May 4, and May 20, and 1.25-percent dimethoate emulsion on June 27  and July 27. The insecticide was applied at the rate of 100 gallons per  acre throughout the study. Several rows of slash pines at opposite ends  of the orchard were unsprayed. Fourteen trees were selected as checks from  the unsprayed area and fourteen trees were used in the treated area. Tallies  were made of the Dioryctria-attacked cones on 20 sample branches on all trees  prior to the first mist application (April 5), on June 6, and at cone-harvest  time (September 7). The cone-infestation tally on June 6 made it possible  to evaluate the effectiveness of each of the dimethoate concentrations .  -7-  The three applications of 2.5-percent dimethoate between April 5  and June 6 resulted in a 71- and 73-percent reduction in Qiorzctfia attacks  on first- and second-year cones, respectively, as compared with check  trees. Percent reduction in cone infestation was statistically significant  at the 5-percent probability level for first-year cones but was only  significant at the 10-percent level for second-year cones.  The two applications of 1.25-percent dimethoate between June 6  and cone harvest resulted in a highly significant percent reduction in  coneworm attacks of 88- and 85-percent on first- and second-year cones,  respectively, as compared with checks.  Statistical analysis of seedworm infestation data has not been  completed but cursory examination of the data shows that the dimethoate  applications did result in very good seedworm control.

S. Forest Service survey. The survey showed the infestation  to be epidemic in nature with approximately 5,000 trees infested. No positive  control action was taken at that time for the following reasons:  1. Lack of funds.  2. Difficulty of operating on private lands.  3. Low value of the timber being destroyed.  State and U. S. Forest Service personnel decided in early 1962 that a  re-evaluation study should be made in 1962. A meeting of the affected land­owners  was held so as to keep them abreast of the situation. This meeting  was held in late spring as part of the state Woodland Forestry program.  In August 1962, the U. S. Forest Service made an aerial survey of the  infested area followed by ground checks. The average attack ratio for the  entire area appeared to be about one new tree for each old tree with some areas  as high as three to one. The ·survey indicated approximately 12,000 to 15,000  lodgeple pine infested during the 1961 flight period in the ~ea between McCall  and Cascade. Egg and larval densities indicated an epidemic infestation.  Control measures were recommended by the survey team with the first step  of control to be a pre-control survey. It was noted in the survey report that  requests for Federal aid for a control project would have to be submitted to  Washington, D. c., by U. s. Forest Service Region IV, pvior to November 1, 1962.  The area was inspected in September, 1962 by Gary Tucker of the state Forestry  Department and Al Dahlgren of the PEcy'ette National Forest. Infested stands were  typed on aerial photos and recommendations were made for an intensive survey and  evaluation of the infested area.  The pre-control survey under the direction of Galen Trostle, of the U. S.  Forest Service was initiated jointly by Federal, State, and private agencies  in October, 1962. The purpose of the survey was to determine the number of  infested trees and the approximate area involved. The survey consisted of  1/4 chain wide linear samples spaced at 5 chain in~ervals. Wet weather and  shortage of manpower made it necessary to discontinue the sampling in favor of  meander strips and off-band estimates of the number of trees infested per acre  to meet the November 1 deadline. The location and mapping of infested areas  was facilitated by two short aeri·al surveys by Gary Tucker of the Idaho State  Forestry Department, and by the use of aerial photos borrowed from the Valley  County ASC Office. The final compilation of survey data was completed by the  U. S. Forest Service and the Idaho State Forestry Department.  The actual cost of the survey is difficult to compute because of the  - 1 -  Owner and Agency Cooperation  The first step in the control project was the declaration of a Zone of  Infestation as prescribed by law (Appendix, Page 7) 9 by the State Forester.  This served as a legal notice of the intent to enter upon private lands for  the purpose of control and gave the State Forester legal authority to do so.  The ownership pattern of land in the infested area required that cooperation  be developed and maintained between the State and the private owners. To aid  in obtaining this cooperation a second meeting was held in the McCall-Donnelly  High School and all Valley County landowners were invited by public notice to  attend. In addition personal invitations were sent owners of land within the  Zone of Infestation whose addresses could be obtained. The meeting was de­signed  to familiarize the landowners with the insect, and to explain the nec­essity  for control. Additional effort was made to gain owner- agency cooperation  by attempting to notifY each owner separately prior to entry upon his land.  In several cases, owners could not be contacted immediately and it was necessary  to begin control without prior notice.  OVerall, owner-agency cooperation was excellent with only two complaints  formally made by landowners. These complaints arose over a misunderstanding  of intentions and the conditions were corrected immediately. One complaint  was in regard to .a merchantable log that appeared partially destroyed and the  other concerned a fence that had been knocked down.  Control Methods and Procedures  Questions considered in determining control methods were:  1. Which agency would be responsible for the control project?  2. What treating methods would be used for control?  3. Should the control work be on a contract with private individuals?  4. Should the landowner be permitted to perform control work on his  own land for which he would be paid i n part ?  Many ideas were discussed in regard to project and area responsibility for  the control work. It was determined that one agency should have overall control  because of the many owners and, since most of the owners were private, the  responsibility fell to the State.  Five methods of treating trees infested with mountain pine beetle were  considered:  1. Logging and removal of infested material to a sawmill, or treating  plant.  2. Cutting and peeling infested trees.  3. Spr~ing infested trees with a solution of ethylene di-bromide.  4. Burning infested trees standing.  5. Burning infested trees in decks.  Most of the timber was too small for sawlogs and the scattered ownership  - 3 -  I  ,)  5. Gain valuable landowner contacts for the furtherance of Woodland  Forestry in this area.  6. Allow study of possibilities for future owner contracted control  in small epidemic areas.  One dollar per tree was offered to the owner as an inducement for him to  perform control on his own land. Some savings would be brought about by this  method of control. Many of the smaller and some of the larger owners indicated  immediate interest, however, much of their interest subsided as the work grew  nearer. Contracts were made with three owners, two of whom completed their con­trol  in a very satisfactory manner.  Organization - General  The Southwest Idaho Area was charged with the responsibility for control  by the State Fbrester. The following is a chart of the control organization:  PROJECT COORDINATOR  {Assistant State Forester) I FIELD SUPERVISOR I (Area Forester)  t I  Tree Location lf'oreman Control Foreman  {Forester) (Fire Warden)  I  I Asst.

Field  records for stripping and spotting were turned in to the bookkeeper who trans­ferred  the information to the strip sheets (Appendix, Page 10), for use by the  treating crews in locating the infested trees. The bookkeeper also maintained  a master list of tag numbers which had been placed on infested trees based on  information supplied by spotting crew field records.  The treating crews carried the strip sheets to aid them in locating the in­fested  trees. They removed the tag from each tree prior to treatment and turned  them in to the bookkeeper each night. He checked the tag numbers against the  master list of tags used. After the strips were completed the master tag list  was compared to the strip sheet and missed trees were noted for rework by the  crew. The tagging and strip sheet method insured almost 100~ treatment of  spotted trees.  Aerial photos were used to locate control unit boundaries and, in areas  where trees were scattered, strips were plotted on 8""/mile aerial photo en­largements  and the approximate Jocation of infested trees were marked in the  strips. ~ this method, treating crews could cross strips from infested tree  to infested tree. This method was especially useful in the Paddy Flat area  where trees were widely scattered and the terrain very rough.  Stringing  The stringer foreman was furnished with aerial photos encased in tracing  film on which the units were laid out by the location foreman. String lines  were assigned by the stringer foreman to each stringer. Each man was trained  in pacing and compass technique and was checked constantly by the stringer  foreman. From a given starting point two chain offsets were made along a road  or other unit boundary and the stringers moved abreast across the unit, made  offsets, and returned. .An, alternate method of assigning each man two or more  strips was used when it seemed beneficial. ~ moving stringers abreast through  a unit, lines were maintained at a more even distance apart; stringers were not  working alone in swampy and rough areas; and the foreman could more easily super­vise  his men. Crew speed was stabilized through individual control.  Stringing crew equipment consisted of:  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 pr.  4 x 4 Manhaul  Universal Jeep (when working a split crew and for foreman use)  5-gallon container for paint thinner  MJbile or portable radio  Silva compass for each man  Nelson paint gun for each man  Hand axe for each man  Snowshoes for each man  Map cases for quart paint cans  Aerial photos of the work area  Paint  Flagging tape  Pocket sized notebooks  Nails  - 7 -  _.  '  '  widely scattered they were marked with wider bands to assist in location by the  treating crews. The first and last tag numbers in a group were recorded with  the strip number and location within the strip.  Spotting crew equipment consisted of:  1 4 x 4 Manhaul  1 4 x 4 Universal Jeep  1 Hand Axe for each man  1 Compass (helpful but not necessary) for each man  1 Map case or nail apron to carry pressurized paint for each man  1 pr. Snowshoes for each man  1 Pocket notebook for each man  Nails  Tree tags  Tag holders  Each spotter turned in a daily work record to the bookkeeper for posting  to the master number list and to the strip sheets.  Location statistics were as follows:  Total trees spotted  Total acres spotted  13,756  12,147  Average length of strip spotted/ manhour  Average number of acres spotted/manhour  Average number of trees spotted/manhour  (Infestation intensity 1.1 trees/A)  14.4 chains  ~.89 ac;:res  3.2 trees  Total tree location cost for the project waL 21 ,731.4~. Project location  costs were $1.6~ per tree and $2.12 per acre. The costs per tree in the Paddy  Flat area were higher ($5.66 per tree and $1.20 per acre), becaus~ of rough  terrain and dispersion.  Thls includes 7 mand~s and 100 vehicle miles on intensive survey in the  Lqwer Big Creek area. To determine if need for control existed, one-quarter­chain  wide linear samples were taken at 10 chain intervals. Strip width was  measured at all points where trees were counted and all infested trees were  checked for larval content prior to counting. Permanent sample plots were  set up by marking the strip center-line with red paint to expedite future  tracking of the infestation in this area. Results of the survey showed 1.79  red tops per acre and 1.73 live infested trees per acre. Control was not  considered immediately necessary even though the area was originally included  in the project. MOst of the infestation is confined to the lower vigor and lower  quality trees in th~ young ponderosa pine stands. Continued spot checking of  the Big Creek area is planned.  TREATING  Treatment by state Crews  Six State supervised control crews were planned but only five were organi~ed  - 9 -  :  :  .  •  trees, terrain, and the size of the trees. The average wage per man for the  three man crew was $1.88 per hour.  Treating cost figures for an optimum situation were as follows:  Salaries and wages  Tractor cost (14.3 trees/hr.)  Diesel (5.5 gallons/tree)  .. 72 per tree  .23 per tree  .T4.per tree  $ 1.69 per tree  The above costs were compiled during February when crews were well trained  and organized and provided better comparison with areas treated by piling and  burning. The costs are not representative of average work or production for  the entire project.  Basic equipment for this type of control was:  1 Manhaul per two crews  1 750-gallon 6 x 6 tank truck per two crews  1 Tractor and trailer unit with 180 - 230 gallon tank and pump  2 Bean nozzles with igniters attached  1 set Mechanics tools  1 Gas container for chain saw  1 Chain saw  1 Ax  Face Shields  Map case for removed tags  Hard hats  2  1  3  3 Rubberized coats for protection from falling sparks  Ponderosa pine  The method of treating in stands of young ponderosa pine was burning-decks.  When considering trees of the same size, this method was more expensive but  gave much more positive control. Trees were felled and hand piled or skidded  together by tractor and 'burned completely. Four-man crews were used in this  operation: 1 tractor operator, 1 sawyer, 1 fire tender, and 1 man working  with the tractor. By the time this method of treatment was started, the  stringing and spotting crews were converted to control and supplied the fourth  man in each crew.  In the East McCall area (Hubbard Area), trees were comparable in size and  average density per acre to most of the lodgepole on other areas but were more  closely grouped. Averages for this area were: 1. 53 trees per manhour at an  average cost of $1.86 per manhour.  Average treating cost figures for this type of treatment were as follows:  Salaries and Wages  Tractor cost ($5.38 tree/hr.)  Diesel (1.02 gallons/tree)  - 11-  $ 1.22 per tree  .62 per tree  .14 per tree  $ 1.98 per tree  .'  ..  spotting costs in the above table are based on the average cost per tree  for the entire project.  The actual cost to the landowners was considerably in excess of the $1.00  per tree payment. The data for the following table was given by the contract­ing  owners.

Boise  Cascade Corporation treated all trees that could be reached easily by burning  standing. A pickup truck .was used to haul a diesel tank with a pump and hose  reel. The hose was pulled to all trees within ten chains of the one main road  through the area. ·Scattered trees in groups of four or more were treated b,y  spreying Ethylene di-bromide from stirrup pumps on the infested trees. The  chemical, oil and pumps were backpacked to each tree.  C. C. McGinnis treated trees on his land by cutting, piling all branches  and litter in the area, and charring the infested trees in post lengths on  the burning piles.  William Blenkinsop began treating by hand peeling all post and pole  material, but forfeited his contract.  Treatment was satisfactory on the two completed area~. It should be noted  that treatment on these areas was initiated as a cooperative effort rather than  as a money-making venture. This type of effort by private industry is highly  commendable •  RECOMMENDATIONS  Survey  Future surveys should be planned sufficiently far in advance to provide  - 13 -  :  One trained forester should be assigned to owner control on any project of  10,000 or more trees. This forester could also encourage the utilization of  material produced by the owner in the form of small products such as hop poles,  utility poles, cor~~ poles, and posts. As more cost d~ta is developed on  control projects;-~he amount offered to the landowner possibly could be raised  from the $1.00 offered on the McCall project. A larger payment would induce  greater participation by owners.  The first item of importance in this form of control is to develop an or­ganization  by supplying sufficient personnel for owner control. The second is  that costs incurred in owner control exceed the inducement payment.  State: The stringing and spotting technique, used on the McCall Bug  Project, made the control portion very easy. All the control crew had to do  was look on the strip sheets, read the location of infested trees and go to  them. One addition that would help to locate trees faster, would be to flag  the tree as well as band it with paint. Some of the paint used would blend  into the bark making it very difficult to find.  In organizing the control crews, it would be better to pick local men as  crew leaders and tractor operators. They seemed to take more interest in  finding all the trees for treatment.  Small crawler tractors pulling trailer mounted tanks, pumps and hose, works  very good until you get into steep frozen or snow-covered ground. It would then  be better to have the equipment mounted on the tractor. Several breakdowns were  caused by the trailer jackknifing while going down hill, damaging pumps, hose  reels, or trailers or tearing the tank loose from the trailer. Here again, a  local man would be better than an outsider for he would know the country in which  he is working.  Where the infestation is scattered instead of grouped, a control crew con­sisting  of one tractor operator, and one nozzleman would be sufficient. They  can do as much work as a three man crew, saving the wages of the third man.  In the pile and burn method of treating, a five man crew consisting of  tractor operator, sawyer, 2 axe men, and 1 choker setter, is sufficient. One  extra man per two crews could be utilized to keep the piles burning, and to  assure total burning.  - 15 -  .•  APPENDIX  !

Cone lus ions  The primary objective of our 1969 research was to determine whether  or not the mountain pine beetle in white pine can be manipulated to a  significant degree through the use of synthetic trans -verbenol plus alpha  pinene. Completion of most of the planned tests produced res ults which are  highly encouraging. We are not claiming actual control of the insect over  large areas, but the tests, conducted in a typical forest environment, have  &gt;!&lt; The writer is indebted to these reports for much of the information con­densed  in this Progress Report #6.  Progress Report #6 e -2- December 18, 1969  conclusively demonstrated that large numbers of naturally-emerged, flying  beetles can be attracted to baited white pines with few attacks occurring on  unbaited pines in the treatment area. Therefore, the possibility of some  degree of control through pest density regulation has been greatly enhanced.  The major hurdle remaining is the development of a more simplified and sure  method of exterminating attracted beetles.  These conclusions are based on the following facts:  1 . Synthetic trans-verbenol at microgram levels plus alpha pinene  is highly competitive with natural attractant sources.  2. The attractant is not difficult to synthesize and high purity is not  required for optimum activity.  3. The physical properties of trans -verbenol and alpha pinene make  possible simple and practical delivery systems such as in small-bore  polyethylene tubing .  4. On the average, the synthetic pheromone attracts nearly equal  numbers of male and female beetles.  5. Large -scale testing of insect and host components of the attractant  complex in a practical release system has been successfully completed.  6 . Although lindane killed an undetermined number of beetles, it  was not completely effective in protecting baited trees .  In this light, trans -verbenol becomes an adjunct to the concepts of  biological control.  SUMMARY REPORT  The 1969 project again consisted of two phases. As previously,  Phase I was basic and developmental research, while Phase II was application  of the best available techniques in a fairly large -scale, but limited, forest test.  The objectives of Phase I are listed below. Following each is a resume  of the methodology and results, with brief discussion where appropriate.  Objective l : Develop and test a simple and reliable technique of  disseminating the attractant compounds in the forest .  Method: Based on numerous tests of several techniques in 1968, the  decision was made to use small-bore, thin -walled polyethylene tubing charged  with the two attractant compounds, synthetic trans -verbenol and alpha pinene.  Laboratory tests of diffusion rates of the two compounds through tubing walls  were s uccessfully completed early in 19 69, thus making possible the use of  Progress Report #t4l -3- December 18, 1969  this delivery system in Phase II. The tubing used had an inside diameter of  . 034 11 and an outside diameter of . 050 11  ; it was loaded with a 60-40 mixture  of trans-verbenol (&gt; 92% pure) and alpha pinene (95% pure).  Results: The system worked as planned under forest conditions for  disseminating trans -verbenol, with adequate diffusion occurring over a period  of at least two months. However, the diffusion rate for the more volatile  alpha pinene proved too high under forest conditions; this necessitated the  placement of supplemental supplies of alpha pinene in separate containers on  all baited trees to maintain the essential simultaneous transmission of the two  compounds.  Objective 2: Determine the relative attractiveness of the formulated  materials used in Phase II, as compared to the natural pheromone.  Method: The attractant-charged polyethylene tubing developed under  objective one, above, was used . One and six foot lengths of the tubing were  tested against fresh white pine billets infested with 125 females in field  olfactometer s.  Results: Both the 1' and 6' lengths of attractant tubing consistently  attracted more beetles than the female -infested billets, averaging 12:1. The  ratio of attracted males to females varied among tests but averaged close to 1:1 .  Objective 3: Evaluate the attractiveness of synthesized trans -verbenol  with varying amounts of impurities.  Method: Field olfactometers were used to test three levels of  impurities, i.e., crude trans -verbenol, trans -verbenol purified by one  distillation only, and trans -verbenol purified by distillation and thin layer  chromatography (TLC).  Results: No significant difference in numbers of responding beetles  was detected among the three levels of purity. This means that the crude  material could be used effectively at considerable cost savings .  Objective 4: Assess the role of selected host volatiles in the attraction  complex.  Method: Several white pine terpines were tested with trans -verbenol  in field olfactometers to measure their relative flight-arrestment activity.  Results: Alpha pinene is the most effective. Myrcene showed some  flight arrestment activity, but even raw white pine resin was not as effective  as alpha pinene.  Objective 5: Determine the range of attractiveness of the polyethylene  tubing used in Phase II.  Progress Report #6 e -4- December 18, 1969  Method: Two field olfactometers were triangulated upwind from a  known brood source (a load of infested logs stacked in a meadow). Pheromone  concentration in one olfactometer was changed as both were moved farther  apart and farther from the infested log deck.  Results: Inconclusive. The test will be repeated in 1970 in a completely  different experimental design.  Objective 6: Ascertain whether or not mountain pine beetles can be  attracted to nonhost tree species and exterminated.  Method: The plan was to spray five each grand fir and western red  cedar with quick-knockdown insecticide (lannate + buticide) and then to bait  each tree with the standard attractant tubing. A plastic apron was to be placed  around the base of each tree to catch dead beetles.  Results: None. The plan could not be carried out because of a  shortage of attractant tubing, i.e., the Phase II project took more than  estimated. The test will be made in 1970.  Objective 7: To determine if the mountain pine beetle (.!2..:.E..:_) could be  induced by heavy baiting of the synthetic attractant to over -attack white pines  to the extent that the resulting brood would be too crowded to develop to maturity.  Method: A single 22 11 white pine located approximately 1000 1 west of the  Jaype log decks was baited with 200 1 of the standard attractant tubing. The  experiment was established on J uly 16, four weeks after the peak flight of D.p.  on June 12-15. All known brood trees had been salvage-logged from the  surrounding area; therefore, the only local source of beetles was from the  log decks in the Jaype mill yard.  Results: By August 21 this tree had a D.p. attack density averaging  approximately 12 beetles per square foot at d. b. h., or about the normal mass­attack  density. Although this particular result was disappointing, two other  results provided a most convincing demonstration of the drawing power of the  synthetic attractant: (a) the mass attack extended to a height of about 100 feet,  and (b) careful inspection of all surrounding unbaited white pines revealed not  even a single beetle attack. This tree has now been felled and sections placed  in forced-rearing chambers to determine final brood development.  Objective 8: To determine the effectiveness of simulated or bogus  trees as trapping devices.  Reason for test: Observations over many years have indicated that  the mountain pine beetle (D.p.) shows a preference for freshly windthrown  white pines. The first tests made by B. T. I. in Idaho in 1965 indicated that,  with sleeve -type olfactometers, D.p. preferred a horizontal alignment of the  traps 10 to 1 over a vertical alignment. Tests in 1968 showed that~ had a  strong preference for baited white pines recently pushed over by a bulldozer  ' .  •  Progress Report #e -5- December 18, 1969  to baited live, standing white pines . If this apparent preference of D . p . for  horizontal configurations could be utilized in some practical way, perhaps an  economical method of control could be developed .  Method: Because of higher - priority project commitments, this  experiment could not be established until late in the season on September 8, a  time when virtually no beetles were flying. Three ""bogus trees"" consisting  of 10"" X 8 1 paper roll cores from PFI1s Lewiston paperboard mill were placed  in the forest edge east of the Jaype mill. The exterior surface of each tube  was coated with ••stickum Special•• and baited with 25 to 30 feet of the attractant  tubing. One trap was erected vertically, and the other two were placed  horizontally within one foot of the ground.  Results: On S eptember 12 and 13, a minor emergence of mountain pine  beetle occurred, just prior to the first fall rain . The source of the beetles  apparently was the log decks in the Jaype mill yard because, as in the  preceding experiment, all brood trees had been previously removed from the  surrounding forest. This emergence, as usual, was much smaller than the  major peak which occurred in June. Even so, in one day the vertical trap  attracted 77 beetles, one of the horizontal traps attracted 239 beetles, and  the other horizontal trap attracted 329 beetles. Total trapped during the two­week  period before cold weather halted beetle activity were 137, 391 and 392  for a total of 920. No white pine trees were attacked adjacent to or in the  vicinity of the traps- -again a convincing demonstration of the attractant •s  drawing power. Also, these results tend to confirm the earlier studies which  showed D . p . has a preference for attractant sources having a horizontal  configuration .  Discus sian: Thre e major faults of the traps were noted--  l . Failure of the sticky compound to securely hold the beetles. They  walked through the 11Stickum 11 much as they do pitch, eventually crawling to  the inside, uncoated surface of the tube . The beetles were immobilized by  cold weather before observations could be completed, but presumably under  spring weather conditions the beetles could have eventually cleaned themselves  and resumed flight. This could be easily overcome by adding a small amount  of insecticide to the 11Stickum 11  ; however, we would prefer to develop a purely  biological control. One potential technique is to coat the inside as well as the  outside of the tube with the tacky c ompound.  2 . The 11Stickum Special•• lost its tackiness after only three weeks 1  exposure, which would complicate its use in large-scale deployment. We will  present this problem to the chemists .  3. The upper tacky surface of the horizontal traps was rather quickly  fouled with needles and twigs falling from the forest canopy. This could be  overcome by use of a paper roof over the trap . Or, the tube could be coated  only on the inside, with the walls perforated to permit beetle entry as in one  olfactometer design. Or vertical traps only could be used, although these  Progress Report #6 e -6- December 18, 1969  were not as effective in this test .  While no definite conclusions on the value of these traps can be drawn  from this small-scale test, it did produce sufficient results to warrant a much  larger test next year . Large numbers of these traps can be made inexpensively  from reject grade polyethylene -coated paperboard. Coating and placing them  in the forest will be costly and cumbersome, but no more so than spraying bait  trees with insecticide. If successful, the advantages of the traps over live  trees are obvious.  Phase II:  Phase II had one major objective --to demonstrate whether or not trans­verbenol  plus alpha pinene can be used effectively to manipulate populations of  the mountain pine beetle in its natural environment. A secondary objective was  to protect baited trees from lethal attack by attracted beetles .  Method: The study area lies near Lightning Point approximately 20  miles northwest of Potlatch Forests, Inc.'s Headquarters operation in Idaho .  A stand of mature 140-180 year old white pine was selected and eight 40-acre  plots were delineated in a semi-checkerboard pattern so that they were not  side by side but their corners could touch. Within each plot white pine on two­chain  centers were selected, marked and sprayed to a height of 18 to 20 feet  with lindane and water (approx. 2. 3% solution).  A few weeks prior to the anticipated spring flight of D.p., 725 white  pines were baited at breast height with the polyethylene tubing charged with a  mixture of synthetic trans -verbenol ( 1 distillation + T LC) and alpha-pinene.  (If a nonho st species was located on the center, it was not baited. ) Approxi­mately  5, 500 feet of the tubing was required for the 725 trees . At the  concentration used, trans -verbenol was evaporating at a · rate of approximately  25 ;J.g/hr/ft of tubing during the period of peak flight. Alpha-pinene evaporated  at a much faster rate and the tubing was depleted of terpene within a few days .  Since alpha -pinene is the key host constituent for trans -verbenol activity,  each tree was rebaited with alpha pinene contained in small polyethylene  bottles or 2 to 4 inch lengths of large -core polyethylene tubing. The rate of  loss was within the range of 1000 - 5000 ;J.g/hr/container.  Some four weeks after the trees were baited, which preceded the  period of peak emergence, surveillance of the plots was initiated by examining  each treated tree. This was continued until the end of August.  A total cruise was made also within each 40 -acre plot to ascertain the  1969 beetle activity in unbaited trees as well as the number and position of  1968 brood sources.  Results: The influence of deploying the attractant is illustrated by  the following table.

Only 21 unbaited pines were mass attacked  in all of the eight 40 -acre plots.  Conclusions: The sum of these observations clearly indicates naturally  emerged, flying beetles can be attracted for some distance and induced to  attack trees baited with trans-verbenol +alpha pinene, with relatively few  attacks occurring on unbaited trees. Measurement or even estimation of the  distance of attraction is a function of many variables which presently a re only  partially understood. Lindane was not 100% effective in preventing mass  attack and subsequent tree mortality.  Discussion: From the available data little can be concluded concerning  the distance o r over what dimensions the attractant was effective . No  statistical analysis of data has yet been made; however, there are several  features of the attack pattern within and outside of the treated 40-acre blocks  which are of interest. There was a definite tendency for the beetles to attack  baited trees in the outer perimeter of the block. This tendency was nearly 2  to 1 . An explanation for this tendency can be offered in that mountain pine  beetles will not fly by an attractive source in search of one more distant.  While the majority of attacks within the baited 40's undoubtedly resulted from  internal brood trees, it is a lso apparent that the attractant drew a significant  number of beetles from adjacent untreated areas into the boundaries of the  treated 40's.  Failure of the lindane to protect baited trees was disappointing. Lindane  is recorded elsewhere as being highly effective on Dendroctonus, and the  reason for its failure in this test is not apparent. Final brood development in  Progress Report #6 e -8- December 18, 1969  the lindane treated trees will not be known until next spring, but based on  present observations, most of the 133 mass-attacked trees will die. Also,  a number of the baited trees were hit well above the 20' of bole sprayed with  lindane (one tree up to 7 5 ') . While this provided a graphic demonstration of  the attractant's power, we had hoped the lindane would protect trees from  lethal attack so as to avoid later removal or treatment. Effective beetle  control requires the elimination of a high percentage of the brood. We have  no way of directly measuring the number of attracted beetles killed by the  lindane; an indication is derived from the fact that 484 of the 725 baited trees  show no attacks, and, even more significantly , only 21 of the intermingled  unbaited pines (at least 7, 800 trees) were mass attacked, and half of these  were within 10 to 15 feet of a baited tree.  Additional information will, no doubt, come to light as we continue  to study the treatment area which will be baited again next year . All 1969  brood trees will be left in the study area to as sure an uninterrupted sequence  of beetle population and behavior as affected by the research procedures .

Disbursements from this fund must be approved by the Idaho State  Land Board.  FUTURE PLANS  Plans for 1970 again include two phases- -Phase I on continued basic  research and Phase II on application of knowledge gained to date .  Phase I will include :  1 . Development of a process for producing trans -verbenol in large  quantities for use by all interested landowners and forest protection agencies.  Comment: This will be contracted to a commercial chemical firm . Battelle  •  Progress Report #e -9- December 18, 1969  Memorial Institute, which has produced all the synthetic used to date, can  continue to produce compounds for research purposes but not in the quantities  necessary for larger scale application.  2. Improvement in attractant formulations and technology of  dissemination. Comment: This summer's tests developed excellent  information but further refinements will be tested in 1970. For example, the  necessity to place supplemental supplies of alpha pinene on all baited trees  resulted in higher labor costs than anticipated. One approach to overcoming  this problem is the use of two tubes or ""double-barrelled"" tubing of different  inside diameters for different volume capacities and different wall thicknesses  for different diffusion rates. Another possibility is the formulation of the  attractant with latex compounds.  Also, a system which would maintain the attractant stations over two  or three growing seasons without interim servicing would simplify the operation .  The attractant compounds are relatively stable during cold weather, becoming  liquid and consequently more volatile when temperatures reach about 600 F.  Battelle's chemists will explore these and other ideas during the winter  so as to have an improved system ready for next spring.  3. Development and testing of various trapping techniques, e.g,,  large vs. small trees, white pine vs. other species, road right-of-way logs,  pushed-over trees, simulated trees, etc. An intensive installation of  simulated tree traps will be plac e d around the Jaype mill yard to determine  their effect on the 1970 attack pattern. Douglas fir beetle attractant will also  be utilized.  4 . Further testing of maximum effective spacing of beetle attraction  stations as related to topographic and surface -weather factors .  5 . Development and testing of more effective methods of exterminating  trapped beetles, both pesticidal and nonpesticidal.  The use of tacky compounds will be further t e sted for effectiveness in  eliminating beetles. We would prefer, of course, to develop a purely biological  system employing no poisonous compounds, but this may not be practicable. In  any event, the highly selective manner of deployment of the insecticides in these  projects should not pose a threat to humans or wildlife.  Another approach will be to attempt to induce ""autocidal"" beetle  behavior by : a-Ac tivating ultra-high attack densities in baited trees so that  resultant broods would prematurely e xhaust their phloem space, and b­Concentrating  attacks on small, suppressed, thin-barked white pines wherein  there would be insufficient phloem and bark thickness to support egg and  larvae galleries .  6. Study of the effect of beetle trapping and exterminating te chniques  Progress Report #6 e -10- December 18, 1969  on wildlife, principally birds. This was planned for 1968, but the hoped-for  specialists were not available . Based on observations to date, we foresee no  hazards to wildlife, but a scientific investigation will be made to satisfy critics.  Note: Some of the tests of Phase I will be conducted in conjunction  with and on the same areas as Phase II.  Phase II  Phase II will be primarily a greatly expanded test of the synthetic  attractant on a large area of white pine type in the same and surrounding area  of this year's project. Techniques successfully used this year will be applied  in a modified form. A ""practical grade"" (crude with one distillation) of trans­verbenol  plus alpha pinene will be used as ""bait"" . Approximately 8, 000 trees  will be baited on 4, 000 acres of private land at a level averaging two trees  per acre . Each tree will be baited with three times the volume of attractant  used this year to increase its range of attraction. Bait trees will be selected  from intermediate crown classes instead of dominant as this year .  On most of the area, baited trees will be left unprotected (not sprayed  with insecticide) to obtain a more accurate assessment of mass attack  pattern and density as influenced by the attractant. Trees mass -attacked in  1970 will be either salvage -logged or sprayed with penetrating insecticide to  exterminate the broods . Bait trees will be located in clumps of two or more  spaced at 200 to 400 foot intervals on main and lateral ridges, rather than single  trees on a· 132' systematic grid on separated 40 -acre blocks as in 1969; this  revised technique will reduce time required for baiting the trees and w~ll make  access much easier, both for placing the attractant and for follow-up treatment  of new brood trees .  In addition to the 4, 000 a c r e s of private land, some adjacent state land  may be treated by state financing .  Estimated Cost of Phase II for 1970  The following cost estimates are reported as guidelines for those who  have expressed interest in applying the system on their own lands . While  these estimates are based on the best present information, please bear in  mind that Items 2 and 3 in particular are subject to much variation, depending  on topography, access, weather, and other variables .  1 . Attractant:  This year Battelle Memorial Institute produced 140 grams (about 1 I 3  pound or 1 I 2 pint) of high purity trans - verbenol for PFI for use in Phase II  at a cost of $3, 000 plus about $1,000 for tubing and charging, or a total of  $4, 000. (This computes to a price of about $800 per oz . or 32 times the price  of Channel No. 5!) The 140 grams was used to bait 725 trees , which computes  •  • Progress Report ~ -11- December 18, 1969  to 0.1931 grams and $5.52 per tree. The cost of synthetic trans-verbenol will,  of course, be g reatly reduced under mass produc tion. Also, this summer's  t ests proved that semi-refined trans -ve rbenol is just as attractive as the  highly purified; use of this ""practical gr ade"" will greatly r educe co sts . On the  other hand, we plan to use about three times the volume per bait tree in next  year's Phase II. We now have a semi-firm quot e of $150 per pound, which will  bait about 760 trees at three times the 1969 level, or 20¢ per tree.  In addition, some money may be needed to underwrite the developznent  of the process for producing synthetic attractant in large quantities. Dr. MeN ew&gt;~,  in his n egotiations with chemical firms, has guaranteed up to $10, 000 of Boyce  Thompson funds to cover the cost so as to assure the availability of sufficient  trans -ve rbenol in time for use in the spring of 1970. However, BTl is under no  obligation to stand this cost, so we will try to solicit r eimbursement funds, if  necessary.  The second r equired compound in the a ttractant, alpha pinene, presents  no problem because it is r eadily available from chemical supply houses at  $1. 30 per gallon. Otte gallon is sufficient for 500 bait trees at anticipated  levels, which computes to 0. 3¢ per tree- -a negligible amount.  We have a firm price on the polyethylene tubing- -$2, 500 for 50, 000 feet ,  which w~ anticipate will be enough for the 8, 000 bait trees planned for Phase II .  This computes to 31¢ per tree.  We have no firm quote on the cost of char ging the tubing with the  attractant, but we think this should not run more than 6¢ pe r tree.  Summary of estimated material costs:  Trans-verbenol  Alpha pinene  Tubing  Charging  T otal  $0.20 per tree  0.31 ""  0. 06 II  ""  ""  $0. 57 per tree  This is only about one -tenth of t he 1969 cost.  Cost per acre at the p lanned levels of baiting of two trees per acre is,  therefore, $ 1 . 14.  2 . Baiting the trees:  The cost of locating the bait trees and placing the attractant is a  &gt;:c Dr. George L. McNew, Managing Director, Boyce Thompson Institute for  Plant Research, Inc., Yonke r s, New York.  Progress Report #6 - -12- December 18, 1969  significant item which will vary markedly depending on topography, ease of  access, and weather. Our actual costs in 1969 were 97f per tree for the 320  acres, but access was extremely difficult and the trees were located on a  systematic 132-foot grid in 8 separated 40-acre blocks. Our 1970 plan to  locate the bait trees on main and lateral ridges will reduce the time required.  However, most of the attractant will have to be placed while several feet of  snow remain on the ground, which will again require over -snow vehicles,  and snow conditions may be difficult . Consequently, we are budgeting 50f per  tree or $1. 00 per acre for the planned level of baiting .  3. Brood extermination:  The most crucial and difficult to estimate cost item is the treatment  of mass -attacked trees to eliminate beetle broods. This year our per tree  costs averaged $3. 64 for labor and l7f for lindane, for a total of $3. 81.  However, our 1970 plan to leave the baited trees untreated prior to beetle  flight with follow-up treatment prior to 1971 emergence may increase costs  over 1969 experience. This year we treated all of the 725 baited trees prior  to beetle flight, of which only 133 or 18% were mass attacked. Our present  knowledge is insufficient to provide a good estimate of what percentage of the  unprotected bait trees will be attacked. We are guessing not more than 40%.  However, the unprotected trees which are mass attacked may have to be  felled for spraying, which would nearly double the cost over 1969. Conse­quently,  we are budgeting $7. 00 per tree which, at the 40% mass attack level,  computes to $5.60 per acre. This is assuming lindane can be used; if  ethylene dibromide is required, cost will be increased somewhat. Of course,  this cost will be eliminated for trees which are salvageable at a break-even  or better cost.  Summary of estimated 1970 total costs for Phase II:  Per Tree Per Acre  l. Attractant $0 . 57 X 2 $1. 14  2 . Baiting trees 0 . 50 X 2 l. 00  3 . Brood treatment 7 . 00 X 2 X . 40 5.60  $7.74  J u stification for Phase II  While the estimated cost of $7. 74 per acre for Phase II may seem a  heavy burden, it is considerably lower than any control effort we have made  in the past. Use of the attractant to draw beetles to pre -located bait trees  greatly lessens the time required to locate new brood trees as compared to  searching for them in large unbaited areas. Also, in general, bait trees can  be established in much more accessible locations as compared to naturally­attacked  brood trees .  ..  ...  .... Progress Report e -13- December 18, 1969  Our 1968 survey of four sections in the Lightning Point project area  indicated a D.p. mass attack density averaging about 4% annually of total  white pine stand volume over the last five years, or per acre mortality of  about 800 bd. ft . annually and 4, 000 bd. ft. for the five -year period. This is  equivalent to a stumpage value loss of $28 per acre annually, or $140 for the  five years at $35 per MBF.  Furthermore, unless checked soon, this present full-scale epidemic  can be expected to ""blow"" into super -epidemic proportions as has already  occurred in other similar stands where infestations have been recorded as  high as 12% annually, with over 50% of the white pine volume killed within  five years .  We do not anticipate that one year's intensive control effort will stop  the epidemic. Perhaps two to three years will be required to reduce the  infestation to an endemic or level of low economic impact. This estimate is  based on two basic assumptions: 1 - The attractant will continue to work as  effectively as it did this year; and, 2 -The beetle broods concentrated by the  attractant can be economically eliminated.  If these assumptions prove correct, and if three years are required  to achieve control, the total estimated cost would be 3 x $7. 74 = $2 3 . 22 .  This is less than the stumpage value of one year's past losses. Also, if the  bogus or simulated bait trees prove effective, costs should be further reduced.  In addition, reducing the number of snags will reduce the fire hazard and  lower fire protection costs. Hence, the control effort is more than justified  on an economic basis alone.  Financing  As in the past, continuation of financial support for this project,  especially Phase I, is based on ""faith, hope and charity . "" Budgeting the 1970  project is almost completed . Boyce Thompson Institute will continue to.  provide, gratis, the necessary direction, field supervision and technical  assistance for both Phases I and II. Potlatch Forests, Inc . , has budgeted  coverage of all other costs of Phase II on PFI lands, as was done this year,  and will again provide field laboratory space and some other facilities for  both phases . PFI may also make a direct cash contribution to Phase I (if  necessary) to assure continuation of the project.  To help underwrite Phase I, we are hopeful of drawing, for the third  time, from the special forest pest abatement account under the Idaho Forest  Management Fund. We will submit a request to the Idaho State Land Board  in the near future. Justification for this request lies in the fact that the  results of the research will benefit all forest owners, public and private .  The 1970 project has been endorsed by the North Idaho Forestry Association,  the Southern Idaho Forestry Association, the Clearwater -Potlatch Timber  Protective Association, and the Intermountain Forest Pest Action Council.  Progress Report #6- -14- December 18, 1969  Participation by Others  There are many thousands of acres of white pine stands on federal,  state and private lands where mountain pine beetle infestations are as high  or higher than in the Lightning Point area. Logging all of these stands rapidly  enough to achieve effective salvage is a physical impracticability.  We feel this research has advanced to the point where testing of appli­cations  by other forest managing agencies, at least on a small scale, is  justified. Also, tests of the attractant in lodgepole and ponderosa pine stands  invaded by D.p. now seem justified. We encourage such tests, which would  add to the fund of knowledge.  Anyone who decides to conduct their own forest trials should notify  us immediately so we can forward this interest on to Dr. McNew far use in  his negotiations with the chemical companies for production of trans -verbenol.  Potlatch Forests, Inc. plans to order about 13 pounds for use in Phases I and  II of our 1970 project, plus some additional treatment of hot -spot infestations  in other white pine stands. The conversion factor we are using for trans­verbenol  is 1. 32 lbs . per 1, 000 trees. This will vary depending on tree size;  we are estimating an average d . b. h . of 20"" for the intermediate trees in the  stands planned for treatment.  Any significant changes in cost estimates will be communicated to  those who request it. Also, we can supply labor cost estimates on a man­day  basis on request.  If requested, we will conduct an orientation and discussion session  early in 1970.  So, again, if you are inte r e ste d le t us know.  Any questions, ideas and criticisms will be welcomed.  Hopefully submitted,  Chairman  ..",,,,2015-08-25,2015-08-25,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/136,136,189.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/189.pdf,forestryresearch136

Loblolly pine cones were more conunonly  infested by Laspeyresia spp . than either shortleaf or Virginia pines. Under  conditions of rearing, considerable diapause of seeffivorm larvae occurred.  Adults of bo~1 species of Laspeyresia and a common braconid parasite, Phanerotoma  sp . , emerged during the year following cone infestation. No second-year diapause  was detected.

Leptoglossus coroulus (Say) (!lemiptera :  Coreidae) was fotmd feeding on maturing slash pine cones in southeastern  Mississippi .  -2/ Beal, R. S., Jr. 1969 . Personal Correspondence. Oct . 14, 1969 .  -3-  Several species of parasites er.1e1 ged from pine cones infested with the primary  anu secondary pests. Hymenoptcn ins be longing to the families Ichnetononidae ,  Braconidae and Platygasteridae are apparently parasitizing one or more of the  cone insects .  Dioryctria spp. may be serving as an alternate host for introduced and  native parasites of a closely related species, the European com borer,  Ostrina nubiZaUs (llubner) (Lcpidoptera: Pyralidae) in this state . An unde Â­termined  Lixophaga sp . (Diptera : Tad1inida) has been reared from corn borer  larvae collected in the northeast part of the state . This is significant in  view of the fact that Lixophaga sp. have been reared from Dioryctria spp. in  other states .  An increased emphasis is being placed by private, state, and federal agencies  on pine seed production in seed orchards and in seed production areas. ReÂ­forestation  and tree improvement programs have created a demand for pine seed,  especially st~erior pine seed. In Mississippi , Dioryctria spp. and oe1er cone  insects are causing an undetermined loss of seed in the aforementioned areas  and also in areas where natural reseeding is desired. There is, therefore , a  definite need for a study of the extent of damage caused by these insects as  well as their host plant preferences, life histories, parasites and predators.  In view of the fact that Dioryctria spp. and 0. nubiZaZis arc increasing in  ~~ortance in U1is state, a knowledge of their common parasites could be of  value in an integrated control program of any or all of these pests.  3. DAMAGE  State Univ., State Colle e--Present study being made on the amount  o see oss ue to Insects 1at occurred in one slash pine and on a loblolly  pine seed orchard in Mississippi .  Kucera, U.S.F.S., S.A.-S&PF, Pineville, La.--Data indicates that over 70% _of  the total mortality of second-year loblolly pine cones in one study area is  attributed to insects; whereas less than 35% of first-year cone mortality lâ€¢:as  attributed to insects. Cone let abortion, due to unlmmvn causes was prevalent  this year.  Mattson, U.S. F. S. , N.C. F. E. S. , St. Paul, ~linn .- -We have nm'l completed ll life  tabJes for cone populations at seven SPAs (uvo consecutive generations of cones  at four SPAs and three single generations at other areas) . Present plans call  for completion of six more life tables and then termination of the study.  Detailed analysis of data has not begun, but son!e of the obvious findings are  that the number of cones surviving on a tree has little correlation lvith the  number of pistillate strobili that initially emerged. Insects were U1c primary  cause of losses, and they destroyed 45 to 95 percent of the potential cones.  me SPAs clearly have a higher insect species diversity and are more hazardous  or cone development than areas with lm..:er insect diversity. We will attempt  ,if relate insect dlversi ty to stand characteristics and surrotmding environ-ntal  diversity.  -4-  Meso, U.S.f.S. , R-6, Portland, Ore . --Dougl as -fir cone crops were light and  scattered throughout Orego11 and Washington this season. This was expected  after the abundant, widespread 1968 crcp. Because of low cone production,  impact by Contarinia and Dioryctria populations was heavy at seed production  areas visited. However, lack of pollen contributed to holding Me gas tigmus  spermotrophus populations in check by r educing filled seed mnnbers .  Parker, U.S.F. S., R-4, Ogden, Utah--TI1e i mpact of Laspeyresia miscitata Heinrich  on a seed crop in a ponder osa pine cone collection area on the Payette National  Forest in southwestern Idaho was studied in 1968.  Either pine seeclwonn larvae or damaged seed, or both, were found in 213 (85%)  of 250 cones examined. In spite of the large percentage of infested cones,  the percentage of s eed loss was not l arge . All factors included, approximately  70% of the seed \vas still sound. A resume of these findings follows:  Seed Per Cone  Total Sound Hollmv Insect-Dama~e  Mean CI* Mean CI ~lean CI Mean CI  79.7 Â±4.6 55.5 Â±2 .6 -9.5 Â±1.2 15.1 Â±2.6  *Confidence interval on the mean at the 95-percent level of probability.  h'hite, U.S.F.S., N.A.-S&PF, Dela\var e , Ohio- -1\n average of 36% of sampled  shortleaf pine cones ''~as damaged by insects on national forest seed production  areas in Missouri in 1969. Insect damage for the 1966-'69 period averaged 18%,  with Dioryctria spp. causing 71% of ~1e damage . Twenty-one percent of the  sampled conelets were damaged in 1969, mainly by the fungus , Aspergillus wentii.  Nebeker, Utah State Univ., Logan--The major insect species found destroying  ti1e cones and seec~ of limber pine , Pinus flexilis~ on ~1e Cache National Forest  are in order of importance: Conopht horus flexilis Hopkins, Dioryctria abietell a.  (D. & S.) and Dioryctria sp. near discZusa Heinrich. Analysis of cone damage  has not been completed but approximately 24% of the cones dissected were  infested with C. fl exi lis and 35% \-.:ere infested \V'i th Dioryctria. A1 though a  higher percentage of the cones were infested by Dioryctria spp., a higher  percentage of the seeds were destroyed by C. fl e:cilis.  Ollieu, Texas F. S. ; Lufkin- -Observations of loblolly cones in Texas show damage  to be caused by some previously r eported insects and some species not reported  from the state. Dioryctria amateUa is the most abundant and destn1ctive.  At least two species of Cecidomyiids have been collected with 17 percent of  the infested cones attributed to their damage . 1\vc hemiptcrans, probably  LeptogZossus corcuZus and Tetyra bipunctata are present. Pityophthorus pulicarius  are abundant and suspected of contributing to the high loss of loblolly conclets.  TI1Tips are also suspected of causing loblolly and slash cone let mortality.  In one instance , an aphid, probably Cinera sp., was observed with its stylet  sunk into a slash conelet.  -5-  Cotmts were made of conel ets :mel cones at one slash and three loblolly orchards  in 1968. Branches with suf{jci&lt;.:nt fruit on them we~e flagged and cotmts made  in the spring as soon as the ccnelets \Â·Jere easily identifiable and again in the  fall prior to harvest . Obsâ‚¬'rvations h'&lt;.:re made on 1240 l oblolly conelets , 773  l oblolly cones , 150 slash cone]ets, and 120 slash cones.  Losses directly attributable to insects ,,Â·ere 3 percent in the loblolly cone lets ,  17 percent in the loblolly cones, zero in the slash conelets and 4 percent in  the slash cones . Losses, o[ course , were consjderably higher Hhen one considers  the additional cones '''hich \â€¢:ere aborted ur \Â·:ere killed by unknown causes .  ~!ortali ty factors in toto caused a 30 percent reduction in loblolly cone l ets ,  a 27 percent reduction in loblolly cones, a 41 percent reduction in slash  conelets and a 7 percent reduction in slash cones.  DioMJctria amatella is the most destructive pest and displays the mos t easily  identifiable damage . A cotmt of loblolly cones in early August shoHed 83  percent of the infested cones to be attacked by the pest. 'The remaining 17  percent of U1e infested cones appeared to be damaged by an unidentified cecidomyiid.  ~1ly a rare occurrence of Laspeyresia spp. has been observed.  I feel the high percentage of loblolly and slash conelet losses attributed to  aborts and unknmvn causes may well be insect caused. The early aborts could  well be caused by ilirips as found in the southeast . Only one thrips was  observed but resin e:x.""Udes over the young conelets much like that found by Ebel  Fully developed loblolly conelets died in groups in 1968 and  Pityophthorus puUcarius adults and larvae were found in most . Dead conelcts  Nhid1 contained no P. puUcarius gave U1e impression iliat the beetle was  secondary . Ye::trian reported the pest as being primary in Arkansas and I fee l  further study would help clarify the issue .  111Cre are m.nnerous encounters with two hemipterans which are probabJy Leptoglcssus  corculus and Tetyra bipunctata as reported by DeBarr. L. corculus immatures  and adults have been observed with their mouthparts sunk deep into loblolly cor.es .  Tip moths and , I assume, Dioryctl'ia cZal'ioraUs , mine tenninals and cause cone  mortality indirectly. However, in Texas seed orchards., there has been only an  occasional dead terminal .  1here are a variety of insects whidt could cause an irr.pact on seed.

Females exhibited a  definite periodicity of their calling behavior during diel light-dark (L: D)  cycles of 12L:l2D at 27Â°C. CaJling behavior was initiated about 6-1/2 hrs  after the onset of the dark cycle, rcad1cd a peak of activity about 2 hrs  l ater, and ceased just pd or to the onset of the light cycle . Mating occurred  most frequently during peak periods of ca11ine, and copulation l asted about  1 hr 40 min . Females usua11y mated once , but were occasionally observed to  mate twice and dcposi ted viable eggs after each mating . 1 !ales were observed  to rna te with as many as 4 females .  The behavior of Dioryctria abieteZZa during pupation and emergence was  investigated. Last-instar l arvae usua11y spin a silken cocoon after they  cease feeding. Within the cocoon, they changed to a greenish-white color prior  t o pupation . Newly-emerged pupae \vere also greenish-lvhite and could be easily  sexed by the presence or absence of the bri11iant red testes of males which  could be seen through the integument of the newly-emerged pupa. 1he color of  pupae shifted from greenish-white at emergence t o tan t o dark brown or bJack  just prior to moth emergence. The cocoon served as an aid to emergence by  providing a sui table surface upon ,,Â·hich the cremastral spines of the pupa could  be attached enabling the moth to pull free of the pupal case , and as a textured  surface upon lvhich the emerging moth could obtain a foothold. Wing expansion  required an average time of 4.5 min.

Genera 1  (Hedlin - B.C., Canada)  Although I was present at the meeting when it was first  decided to assemble and distribute the Cone and Seed Insect  News letter, it isn't correct to say I initiated it. Ron Stark,  Thomas Koerber, Kenneth Wright, Leon Pettinger, LeRoy ~Â·! ill iams on,  Russell ~l itchell, Nonnan Johnson, and I \'lere present at the meeting  which took place in Spokane in June 1960 when it was decided to  compile a Newsletter. As a matter of interest, I enclose a copy  of a report on the meeting, and as you will see from it, Norman  Johnson agreed to assemble and distribute the first copies of the  Newsletter. Initially, it ~1as done t~1o times per year but this  was later reduced to one.  The consensus of the group was that to prevent  duplication in the rapidly growing field of cone  and seed insects research, a semi-annual newsletter  describing recent findings and other items of  interest should be mimeographed and distributed to  those working on cone and seed insects in the  Western United States. Johnson, as usual, lost a  toss and will prepare the newsletter for the first  year. Items for t he first report are due at the  end of July and those for the second report in  February.  Several studies which are currently being conducted relate  directly to problems in seed orchards.  (a) Cambial mining Vio~y~ are a chronic problem in graft  unions of Douglas-fir seed orchards. Studies are being conducted  for information on nature and extent of damage, species involved  and control methods. Larvae were collected from cambial mines and  reared in the laboratory on a bark medium for information on larval  development. Thera are several species involved. At least one  species (Vio~y~ 4bietivo~ella) feeds in both cones and cambial  llcontributions submitted by cone and seed insect research  workers, resource managers, and tree improvement specialists. These  unpublished data cannot be used without contributor's approval.  Items assembled by G. L. DeBarr, U. S. Forest Service, Athens, Ga.  2  mines. ~dults have been obtained for 1p'ositive identification on  the species involved.  (b) Preliminary studies using light traps (similar to technique  of Yates and i1erkel) were conducted to ascertain the possibilities  of this technique for sampling populations and possible control in  seed orchards. Results of these early studies were not promising.  (c) Cones have ' been collected from a number of different  Douglas-fir clones and will be examined for differences in insect  infestation.  (d) Seeds from Douglas-fir, spruce, and ponderosa pine are  being tested to compare germinabil ity of apparently normal seeds  from infested and uninfested cones.  (e) Seeds from Vapona-treated cones and from non-treated cones  are being compared for germinability.  (f) Laboratory studies are being conducted to obtain preliminary  information on dispersal in litter of overwintering Hy!emya  a~cina, as pest in spruce cones.  (Pierce- California)  Region 5 has initiated discussions to acquire the use of land  in the Sacramento Valley to raise superior conifer trees as a seed  orchard. The site is a considerable distance from the forest zone.  If the orchard is established, it is hoped that the trees will not  be contaminated with wild pollen and will remain free of cone and  seed insect infestations because of this isolation from the forest  environment.  (Goyer - Louisiana)  Mr. ~lark Chatelain has initiated a master's program of research  at L.s.u. aimed at the biology of the important seed orchard insect  pests of loblolly pine in Louisiana.

The follO':~ing is an abstract of his dissertation entitled  ""Bionomics of the Cone and Seed Insects of Ponderosa Pine in Idaho  and Adjacent Washington and Nontana ...  The cone and seed insects of ponderosa pine, P~naÂ¢ pondekoÂ¢a  var. po~tdekoÂ¢a La\'IS., were investigated to anticipate future seed  losses in seed orchards and seed-production areas established in the  Idaho Tree Improvement Program. Life histories and habits were  studied in cases where information was lacking or incomplete.  Seed and cone losses \'tere caused primarily by the fol101Â·1ing  s pee i es: LaÂ¢peyJteoJ.a. m.i.Ac.-i;ta;ta Heinrich, La.i&gt; peyJteoJ.a. p~pe~tana  Kearfott), ConophtholtaÂ¢ pondeltoÂ¢ae Hopkins, Leptogl oÂ¢Â¢UÂ¢ occlde~  Heidemann, V~Jttjc..br.J.a. aWta.nti.ceUa (Grote), V~Jttjc:tJr.J.a. ab~e:teUa  ( 0. & S. ) , Euc.o.&ma pond ei!.OÂ¢ae PO\'!e 11 , and A.&tjnap.ta. k.ee~ (Foote) â€¢  All species, \'lith the possible exception of A. keeM, have t he  potential for caus ing serious losses. At $10 .00 per pound, the value  of seeds lost to cone and seed insects varied from $3.06 to $207 .26  per acre.  LaÂ¢peyJtuJ.a. r7UAU.ta..ta. \'las by far the most ubiquitous species,  and together \Â·lith L. p~peltatta. , damaged 3% to 73% of t he seeds. The  larvae feed until enteri ng the cone axis in late July and August.  One entrance per larva is made into the axis . The number of holes  per axis indicates the number of larvae t hat once infested vacated  cones.  To reduce seed losses caused by La.&pe!flte.6l.a. spp., future seed  orchards and seed-production areas: (1) should not be located in or  near stands stocked predominantly with ponderosa pine; (2) should  not be located within orÂ· adjacent to stands with crown closures  greater than 50 to 60%; (3) should be located in mixed stands whose  climax type is as remote as possible from ponderosa pine; and (4)  should have the trees wel l spaced. Trees with rapid growth had  smaller seed losses and infestation levels than those with slow  grmÂ·tt.h . Preferable sites for the establishment of seed orchards  for mimi num loss would be those where t he spring months have low  evaporation rates or high precipitation levels.  Conophthoi!.U.6 pondeltoÂ¢ae caused damage at 2 of 13 sites where it  destroyed as much as 98% of smal l cone crops. This beetle will pose  a problem in open stands, such as seed-production areas and seed  orchards, and is the most serious pest that will face orchard  managers.  Distribution of La.i&gt;pe!flte..&J.a. spp. and c. pondelto.&ae between  trees of dense and sparse crown characteristics indicated that  pruning and thinning of the crowns would not have any effect in  regulating insect numbers per tree.  I  /  5  Leptogto~~ ~ occide~ occurs throughout Idaho . Damage  varies with the stage of seed maturity at the ti me of attack and  resembles seed abortion in ~any characteri st ics. This bug damaged  17% of the total seed crop at the site where it was most abu ndant~  and 27% of t he seed of cones on which adul ts and nymphs were  observed .  V-i..otr..yc.:t!U.a awz.a.rt..U.c.eil.a. v1as 1 oca 1 i zed in occurrence but has a  high pot en tial for damage. Damage at Mi ca, Idaho i ncreased f rom  1.5 to 57% in two years. Cones vlitr1 one or two larvae often survive  but fail to open and release the physical ly undamaged seed .  Damage from V-i..otr..yc:tJci.a. abiete.Ua. was greatest at sites south  of t he Salmon River. Heavy scale damage in a cone i ndi cates poor  seed viability. Light feeding in scales is not detri mental to  seed germination.  Damage from Euc.ollma. pondetr..ollae was absent from sites north of  the Salmon Ri ver. Damage pr imarily consists of mined scale tissues.  However , seed losses ranged from 20 to 35% in 8 of 10 cones with  50% or more of their scales damaged .  Larvae of AÂ¢1jnapta keen.&lt;. occur in, darkly stained, pitch-filled  pockets and usually are associated with seed or aborted seeds.  Damaged seeds often have surface ""d imples"" carved by the l'arvae.  Total seed losses were 1% or less, and loss in infested cones was  14%.  Factors limiting one or more of t he cone and seed insects  incl ude parasites and predators, severe winter tempe ratures~ failure  of cone crops, interspecific competition, cone response to spring  moisture, and vertebrate predators.

Basically, the sampling method  being evaluated consists of randomly tagging 10 percent of the  flower clusters on each of two ramets per clone. The individual  flowers of each sample cluster are observed at monthly intervals  from the time of flower formation through cone maturity. All  causes of injury to each cone are recorded on standard forms  throughout cone development.  At cone harvest the seed from each cone are counted, radioÂ­graphed  to obtain seedbug damage estimates, and germinated to  estimate seed viability. The results of these studies will be used Â·  to produce life tabl~for the different species of cones and to  estimate the impact of various destructive agents on seed yields  of the different orchards. These results should also provide  basic information needed for developing seed-yield prediction  models and for developing sampling methods necessary for evaluating  insect control measures in seed orchards.  (Goyer - Louisiana)  A cooperative study of seed and cone losses in loblolly pine  (F. s. Alexandria, LA Forestry Commission and L.S.U. cooperating)  was completed in October 1974. In line with earlier Newsletter  reports, losses were high, especially during the first year of  conelet development. Total losses by all causes were 83.5% over  the 2-year study. Of this loss, 75% was caused by insects.  Vio~y~ spp. accounted for 57% of the total. loss followed by  11 undetermined insects"" with 13%. Other causal agents were of minor  importance. Numerous cones were observed being attacked by the  seedbug Tety~ bipunctatd. Analyses of data indicate a difference  in attack levels among the 14 clones sampled with a range of loss  from 68.2% to 96.4% per clone.  (Meso - Oregon)  The western seedbug, Leptogio~~u& occide~, is exerting  an increasing impact at our Dorena Seed Orchard near Cottage Grove,  Oregon. This facility produces blister rust-resistant western white  pine seed and reforestation stock for 25 different seed zones in  Oregon and Washin9ton. Seedbug population levels in the orchard  depend on cone availability in Douglas-fir stands adjacent to the  orchard's perimeter. In 1974 the only cones produced were those in  the orchard, and these cones attracted numerous adults. Orchard  practice includes bagging each second-year cone in early spring to  catch and retain any released seeds until the cones are harvested  /I  8  later that summer. Cone bagging has effectively deterred western  seedbug damage. A field evaluation is planned for 1975 to determine  the effectiveness of different bagging methods.  (Torgersen and Harris - Alaska)  Cones of Sitka spruce were collected on the Valley Sale Area  at Raspberry Strait, Afognak Island in the fall of 1973. The  samples were taken from branches of several mature trees recently  felled during the logging operation. The cones were shipped to the  Forestry Sciences Laboratory at Juneau, where the seed tests were  conducted.  After air drying at room temperature for about 10 days, seed  was extracted using a mechanical cone shaker, dewinged and cleaned.  Before conducting the cutting tests, subsample weights were obtained  and a seed count made. The results appearing below represent figures  for subsamples representing a total sample containing 5886 seeds.  Seed condi~ion was determined by cutting tests run on two subsamples  totaling 565 seeds or about 1 percent of the total. The table shows  results of the cutting tests.

Since there  is some concern that there will be adequate restocking after cutting,  it would be advisable for research and/or the RMA to keep abreast of  seed condition in critical areas.  (DeBarr - Georgia)  A cooperative agreement with the Eastern Tree Seed Laboratory  (State and Private Forestry) was renewed for a second year, and the  summary of the thre~ years of the Seed Orchard Survey was completed. ,  Tbe data include (a) cone yields and cone insect damage from f ield  observations; (b) seed 'viability, seed yield and seedbug damage from  laboratory analysis; and (c) efficiency in terms of tree potenti als .  This survey provided comprehensive data on the impact of cone and  seed insects in 27 seed orchards in the South.  ~---------------------------------------------~~~-  , I  I  9  In 1973 t\'10 studies \'/ere initiated to detennine the impact of  seedbugs in operational loblolly and slash pine seed orchards. The  loblolly pine study \'las installed in 14 untreated orchards of the  North Carolina Tree Improvement Cooperative. Small screen wire  cages \'lere used to protect second-year cone clusters from seedbugs  on 168 ramets representing 78 clones. Seedbug-damaged seed observable  on radiographs of uncaged samples from the same ramets averaged 11  seed/cone for the 14 orchards and ranged from a low of 1 damaged  seed/cone to a high of 28 damaged seed/cone. Overall, the caged  cones from the 14 orchards produced an average of 6 more seed/cone  and 15 more filled seed/cone. Less than 1 seed/cone was classified  as 11Seedbug damaged"" on the radiographs of samples from the caged  cone clusters. The slash pine -study was installed on 42 clones in  7 Florida Cooperative orchards. The results of this study are not  complete.  The impact of seedbugs on control pollinated slash pine cones  was studied in cooperation with project SE-1502. The seed yields  from self-, polycross-, and wind-pollinated cones were compared  with and without screen wire cages. Screen wire cages greatly  increased seed yields from all pollination methods. With cages,  the wind-pollinated cones produced an average of 116 filled seed  per cone compared to 20 filled seed from the uncaged cones.  4. Control  (Meso - Oregon)  Because we have no progressive concept, such as the Southern  Seed Orchard Pest Committee coordinate pesticide te-sting, dimethoate  is still the only chemical registered for Douglas-fir cone and seed  insect control at a one-half percent dosage rate applied as a  hydraulic spray. Some of our past control projects found that this  dosage rate produced nonsignificant results. The D. T. Mason Seed  Orchard, operated by the Timber Service Company, Sweet Home, Oregon,  is in production, and in 1974 the only cones in the area were located  in the seed orchard. To minimize insect impact and to insure seed  supplies for their reforestation needs, Timber Service Company made  the decision to use dimethoate but at a one percent rate. In both  Oregon and Washington, a private applicator can deviate from the  label registration if the chemical is confined only to their own  lands and they assume any risks. One application of one percent  dimethoate was applied with the following results:  Midges  Moths  Chalc1d  \ Percent Seed loss  Treated Untreated  1.8  0.1  1.9  21.9  23.0  9.0  10  Usable seed yield for the treated cones amounted to 36 percent, in  contrast to the untreated cones which produced 19 percent unaffected  seeds. Dimethoate is phytotoxic to the older tree foliage. Degree  of phytotoxicity is related to weather conditions and dosage rate.  Trees that exhibited the greatest needle damage in early spring  began showing subtle graft incompatibility signs later during the  summer.  (Hedlin - B.C., Canada)  Dacron net bags were placed over cone-bearing Douglas-fi'r  twigs on which cones Â·were infested with~~ cot6a~na eggs.  Sections of Vapona strip were placed in some bags to determine their  effectiveness in preventing insect damage following oviposition.  (Cade - Washington)  A small scale (10 tree) insecticide screening trial was  carried out against the Douglas-fir coneworm V~o~y~ spp. in the  ~1cDonald Seed Orchard near Chehalis, Washington. Insecticides were  applied once only as 0.75% active sprays to 25 cones per tree in  mid~June. Evaluation as follows is based on percent of cones  infesteC:I:  '  'I I  Insecticides.

The results showed similar trends in all test orchards.  V~~y~ spp. control ranged from good to excellent. Single soil  applications were more effective than spreading the same amount of  insecticide over 2 or 3 applications. Eueo~ma control on Virginia  pine was outstanding. Preliminary appraisal of the radiographic  data indicated that .carbofuran was also very effective in reducing  seedbug damage. Treated trees from several of the seed orchards  yielded 2 to 5 times more full seed per cone as unprotected cones.  I,  ' I  11  (Goyer - Louisiana)  Furadan and Thimet 10% granularsapplied by a Gandy spreader  effectively reduced conelet losses to loblolly pine.

April 9, and May 29 (total 12 oz. per inch  DBH) (3X). Trees averaged 4 inches DBH. Treatments consisted of  1 acre blocks replicated 4 times per treatment. Five clones per  block were chosen for evaluation. On each tree (clone) 10-23  conelets were tagged at tfme of flowering fn March 1974 and evaluÂ·  ations conducted monthly.

Three levels of material were  applied: (1) all on March 21; (2) ~dose each on March 21 and  May 29; and (3) l/3 dose each on March 21, May 29; and June 25,  to 6 different clones.. Seventy-two trees were involved in the test.  The only statistically significant difference was the percent of  Vio~yettia damage between clonal types within the orchard.  (Gage - Arkansas)  Eight insecticides were evaluated on loblolly pine for control  of Vio~y~. Materials were applied with respect to adult activity  in the area. Five foliar sprays were applied approximately during  peak adult emergence and 3 granular systemics were sprinkled under  the trees approximately 1-2 months prior to expected adult activity.  Of the foliar sprays, Guthion 0.5, 1, 2 lb ai/100 gal; Zectran 1,  4 lb ai/100 gal; and Dipel 1, 4 lb af/100 gal appeared to be the  most effective, while Imidan 0.5, 1, 2 lb af/100 gal and Gardona 1,  2. 4 lb ai/100 gal showed less reduction of damaged cones. The  only material showing any visible degree of phytotoxicity was  Zectran 1, 2, 4 lb af/100 gal. Results of Dfpel indicated the method  12  of timing was fairly accurate. Baygon 0.2 oz ai/in DBH and Furadan  0.2 and 0.4 oz ai/in DBH appeared to be the better systemic treatÂ­ments.  Temik 0.2 and 0.4 oz a1/in DBH showed no reduction in cone  damage.  (Neel and Jones -Mississippi)  This is a summary of the 1974 carbofuran study for control  of V~~~ spp. on slash pine at the Scott Paper Company Seed  Orchard in Greene County, Mississippi. The experiment was conducted  in the northeast annex (approximately seven acres) of the orchard .  and was not sprayed for insect control as was the rest of the  orchard. Trees averaged 25 feet in height and 5-6 inches DBH.  The trees are located on points 30 feet apart and rows 30 feet apart.  The soil is sandy and the ground cover is mainly bahia grass.  Carbofuran 10% granular was applied on 7 April and 6 June,  using 5 different treatments: control - no insecticide applied;  band- 4 oz./inch DBH; broadcast ~1) - 4 oz./inch DBH; broadcast (2) -  ~./inch DBH; drill - 4 oz./inc DBH. The experimental design  used was a randomized complete block design. Five clones were used  with 1 ramet/clone in each treatment {5 trees/treatment).  At the time of application the vegetation under all trees was  mowed in order to reduce the uptake of the insecticide by the ground  cover. Banding consisted of incorporating the carbofuran into the  soil with a fire rake in an 8-10 inch band along the drip-line of  the tree. In broadcasting, the granules were applied to the soil  surface within the tree-crown projection and no attempt was made  to incorporate the granules into the soil. Drilling consisted of  digging six shallow holes about 1 inch deep, evenly spaced, around  the drip-line. Carbofuran was poured into the holes and covered  with soil.  All conelets and cones were tagged in March on each tree and  checked monthly from April through September.

In 1973 a small experiment was conducted in a seed orchard  in Hamilton Co., Florida to evaluate the effectiveness of Furadan  10% granular (carbofuran) for tipmoth control. The Furadan was  applied to first-year, grafted outplants of slash and loblolly pine  on 10 July 1973, the date of planting. Furadan granules was also  applied to two-year-old grafted sand pine. All three pine species  received dosage rates of 10, 20, 30, and 40 grams of Furadan lOG  per tree, applied in a narrow band around the tree base on the soil  surface about 4 inches from the tree and then lightly covered with  soil by means of a hoe. In addition, 10 and 20 grams of Furadan lOG  was placed in the bottom of the planting hole just prior to planting  of some slash pine only. Twenty trees were used for each treatment  and an equal number of untreated trees was used for each pine species â€¢ â€¢  As of 30 November 1973, all treatments showed virtually complete  control of tipmoths, pine webworm, and spider mites. Needle-tip  burn and yellowing of foliage was most prevalent at the two highest  dosage rates but these symptoms occurred more irratically at lower  dosages. No tree mortality occurred.  Another test was established in a slash pine plantation in  Taylor Co., Florida that was planted in December 1972. Furadan lOG  was hoed into the soil around the bases of the trees on 16 May 1973  at 0Â·, 5-, 10-, and 40-gram per tree rates. As of November 1973, all  Furadan-treated trees were completely free of tipmoth attack whereas  39% of the check trees were infested. Needle-tip burn was prevalent  at the 40-gram rate.  Since Furadan lOG is currently registered for use to control  the pales and pitch-eating weevils in pine plantations, we encourage  entomologists to obtain tipmoth efficacy data Â·and phytotoxicity  data with the purpose of obtaining registration of Furadan lOG at  the earliest possible date.  Even though tests with Furadan soil applications for cone and  seed insect control look encouraging in the South, many more carefully  planned and conducted field experiments are needed before we seek  registration for this chemical. Â·  (Merkel - Florida)  I refer readers to pages 5-6 of the April 1974 Newsletter  where I described results of a small field experiment to control_  Vio~yettla spp. with Furadan~ 10% granules in a slash pine seed I  orchard. In February 1974, 10 months after the last Furadan  ' â€¢  14  application in this same study, I made a tally of sound, thripsÂ­killed,  and thrips-damaged female strobili on 100 strobili per  study tree. An average of 28% of the female fl~1ers were thripsÂ­killed  on untreated trees whereas only 14% were killed on FuradanÂ­treated  trees. In addition, thrips-damaged flowers averaged 33%  less on treated than on untreated trees. Differences in thripsÂ­caused  flower mortality and damage, between treated and untreated  trees, were statistically significant at the 5% probability level.  The encouraging results of the February 1974 flower mortality/  damage evaluation led me to assess Vio~y~ infestation on  second-year cones at cone harvest in September 1974. Coneworm  attacks were very 11 ght overa 11 but untreated trees sus ta 1 ned an  average of 3.4% maturing cones per tree whereas cone attacks on  1973-treated trees averaged 0.9%. This difference was statistically  significant at the 1% probability level.  Encouraged by the above results, I installed another field  experiment in this same slash pine seed orchard in 1974. Furadan  10% granular was applied to the soil surface and lightly disced  into the sod. A single application was made on 11 April 1974 at  three dosage rates, i.e., 0, 10, and 20 ounces of the 10% granules  per inch of tree d.b.h. Each dosage rate was applied to 27 trees  in a completely randomized design. Based only on a tally of  V~~y~-attacked cones harvested with a tree-shaker machine in  September 1974, no significant reduction in coneworm attacks was  obtained with either Furadan application. The fact that overall  V~~Y~ infestation of second-year cones averaged less than 5%  in all treatments in 1974, and that tree shakers do not consistently  harvest 100% of either sound or insect-attacked cones, may have  contributed to the complete lack of insect control obtained in this  experiment.  (DeBarr - Georgia)  Guthion is currently the only insecticide registered for cone  and seed insect control in older seed orchards, and the label is  restricted to slash pine. Data from 4 new tests were submitted in  February 1975 to support the request for an extension of the Guthion  registration. Data from earlier tests by Merke1 andÂ· l ,on .,longleaf  pine, as Â·,well as cooperative tests con~ycted from 1971-1913 in two 1  slash pine orchards, were also '1nclude&lt;i. 'Hopefully, this efficacy Â·  data will be sufficient to extend the Guthion registration to include  coneworm, seedworm, and seedbug control on ""southern pines.â€¢  '  15  Publications  (Hedlin- B.C., Canada)  The North American Forestry Commission, FAO, will sponsor a  publication on Cone and Seed Insects of North America.

General  l/  CONE AND SEED INSECT NEWSLETTER-  (Johnson - Indonesia)  March 1976  I haven't had much time to do much professional entomol ogy  here in Borneo, but there certainly are a lot of interesting insects  for the ""oh my"" collector. On my desk is a 4-inch-long cicadid,  two very large rhinoceros beetles, and a colorful cerambycid . I  keep promising myself that I'll put together a col l ection before I  leave here. I have looked at a few samples of dipterocarp seed  and have found as many as 90 percent infested with weevil larvae.  Mr. Daljeet- Singh, forest entomologist at the Forest Research  Institute, Kepong, Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia, has worked with  seed pests of dipterocarps and says that weevils of the general  Ateidodeh and Nanophyeh are the major pests with a few microÂ­lepidoptera  and scolytid beetles of the genus Poeciiip~ being of  l esser importance.  One really appreciates the problems of tropical foresters in  securing good seed. Most of the tropical species in this area have  very short lived seed. For exampl e, few dipterocarp seed will store  for more than a couple of weeks. The same is true of the conifers  Ag~ and AAau~a. Without seasons, there is apparently no  evolutionary advantage to seed dormancy . Best wishes.  (Yearian - Arkansas)  Gerald Wallis transferred from research on cone and seed  insects to research on the southern pine beetle . Harold N. Greenbaum,  having nearly completed doctoral requirements at the University of  Florida, was hired to continue research on cone and seed insects in  Arkansas pine seed orchards. His special interest is sawflies and  is interested in receiving xyelid sawfli es, particularly those that  feed on pine male strobili.  (Stevens - Colorado)  Our work on the seed and cone insect complex in Engelmann  spruce is being conducted on the Fraser Experimental Forest in  llcontributions submitted by cone and seed insect research  workers, resource managers, and tree improvement specialists. These  unpublished data cannot be used without contributor ' s approva l .  Items assembled by G. L. DeBarr, U. S. Forest Servi ce, Athens, Ga.  ('_, .  2  central Colorado and is in its second year. We now have a few  items to report. Laopey~~ia youngana (Kft.) is undoubtedly the  primary cause of seed destruction in Engelmann spruce on our study  area. Seventy-five percent of the cones collected in 1975 were  infested, and 39.1% of all seeds were destroyed. We have reared  numerous other insects, some yet unidentified, and we will have  more information on these by next printing. We 1 ve also used light  traps to collect emergence information on some of these insects.  This information, too, will be available at a later date.

Flavell, Supervisory Entomologist, S&PF, Forest  Resource Protection, Asheville, N. C., transferred to S&PF, Forest  Environmental Protection, Missoula, Montana, in July 1975.  Larry R. Barber was hired as an entomologist with S&PF, Forest  Resource Protection, Asheville, N. C., July 20, 1975.  Projects for next year include (1) a Region-wide impact  study, (2) an applicator test to apply Furadan lOG to the soil,  and (3) a Furadan test on white pine.  3  (Hertel - Louisiana)  The Southeastern Area, State and Private Forestry, Resource  Protection Unit, has realigned to form four separate groups, two  of which will be involved in seed orchard work, i.e., the Forest  Insect and Disease Management Group and the Methods Application  Group.  The Forest Ins ect and Disease Management Group will be charged  with seed orchard evaluations and recommendations, while the  Methods Application Group will be involved with the leadership,  planning, and direction of methods application and development  testing activities.  Frank M. Yasinski is the Group Leader of the FI&DM and MAG  Group in Atlanta. The Asheville Field Office has John H. Thompson  (FI&DM) and Robert D. Wolfe (MAG) as Field Representatives.

C., Canada )  Work in progress: Field tri als were conducted using 15  differ ent synthetic compounds to obtain some prel imi nary information  on attractants for male moths of B~bana eoifiaxiaÂ»a. Compounds were  used wi th Pherocon-2 insect traps. One of t he compounds,  ci s- 9-dodecen-1-ol , was strong ly attractive . In simil ar trials  wi th L~p~yn~ia youngaÂ»a, trans -7-dodecen-1 -ol proved to be strongly  attractive to male moths . Pheromone extraction and bi oassay studies  are being conducted on beth species . Dr. I . Weatherston , a chemist  from Saul t Ste. Marie, Insect Pathology Research Institute , will  spend January and February at the Pacific Forest Research Centre  carrying out the extraction work. If results of bioassays show  promi se, further field trials will be conducted in 1976.

(Goyer - Loui si ana)  Analyses of t he prec ise attack peri ods of insects affecting  l obloll y pine and seed cones revea l ed that two species of V~ony~  cone\'/orms , V. fueiMa and V. ~o~, have but one generation  per year in Loui s i ana. A th i rd speci es , V. amat~, was t he most  prevalent in t he one seed orchard studi ed and was found to have 4  or 5 generat i ons per year . Thr i ps were found feeding directly on  l oblol ly conel et s and cones f rom March to May . P~yophthonM sp.  was found to have one generati on per year, i niti ati ng attack in  5  March and early April. The seedbug Tetyha b~punctata oviposits  in late July and August, and nymphal development was completed  before cone harvest in early October. Overwintering adults have  been observed in November, March and May.  (Yearian and Greenbaum - Arkansas)  Initial biological studies on V~oJtyc;t!U_a ""a.ma.-te1..la.."" (Hulst)  indicated 3 apparent chromomorphs with considerable overlap. Five  groups were recognized: A) typical ""ama.Xe1..la.."" which have the  forewings black to smoky with distinctly white crossbands having  few grey scales, and few if any amber scales; B) intermediate  ""ama.Xe1..la.."" which are similar to A but have the crossbands with  considerable numbers of grey scales; C) "".ta.e.d.a.e.""-like \â€¢Jhich have  the forewings mostly smoky with the crossbands distinctly grey  and with several interdispersed amber scales in the basal 0.67 of  the wings; D) intermediate ""n. sp. (z-imme.tuna.M complex)"" which are  simi lar to C but have considerable numbers of amber scales in the  basal 0.67 of the forewings giving the forewings a noticeably  ferrugineous background color; and E) ""n. sp . (z-i.mme.Jtma.M complex)""  which has the background color distinctly ferrugineous from a  profusion of amber scal es, and distinctly grey crossbands. Groups  A and E are V-toJtyc;tJU_a ""ama.Xe1..la.."" (Hulst) and ""n. sp . (z~me.Jtma.~  complex)"" as defined in Ebel et a1... (1975); group C resembles  V . .ta.e.d.a.e. Schaber and \~ood, but is not positively determined as that.  These chromomorphs suggest a chromo-complex genetically or environÂ­mentally  determined which may also have a biolog i cal effect. Furthe1A  studies are planned to compare biological and ecological data of the  different chromomorphs, and to attempt to i solate genetic factors  by controlled mat ings.  Several parasitoids were reared from various cone and seed  insects.  3. Damage  (Cameron - Texas)  As part of the cooperative effort directed by Carl Fatzinger  to quantify the impact of i nsects on southern pine seed yields, the  Texas Forest Service establi shed a study in a loblolly seed orchard  v1hich will continue through the 1976 cone harvest. A caging study  is being conducted parallel to the impact study to help quantify  losses caused by seedbugs .  6  (Copony and Tigner - Virginia)  A two-year caging study to evaluate cone and seed insect damage  in our l oblolly seed orchard was completed this fall. Data are stil l  being analyzed. There is some indication that empty seed in caged  cones may result in part from the caging i tself , even when cones  are enclosed after pollination.  (Hertel - Louisiana)  An undetermined species of needle midge, Co~ sp. ,  caused dieback to loblolly pines at the Erambert and McNair Seed  Orchards in Mississippi (1971-1975). Seventeen percent of the  loblolly pines suffered medium to heavy dieback due to defoliation  by the midge at the Erambert Orchard during 1974, and certain clones  of loblolly at the McNair Orchard experienced severe defoliation and  dieback due to midge infestation during 1975.  The midge feeds beneath needle fascicles causing brown l esions  and needle bending, which are manifest when needles grow out. Heavy  feeding results in needle drop. CygorriD and GuthionÂ® sprays are Â·  suspected as factors that contribute to midge epidemics. A feeding  preference for certain cl ones was shown by the midge at both the  Erambert and McNair Orchards .  (Barber - North Carolina)  For the past 2 years , one seed orchard has experienced high  conelet abortion in July and August . About 200 Moodna o~tninetta  Clemens were reared from the dead aborted conelets . The conelets  sho\~ed no exterior insect damage, but appeared to be off color and  when touched would readi ly fall off the tree. This insect, whi le  reported to be a secondary pest, was found quite often in dead  cone lets .  (Hertel - Loui s i ana)  A total of 92.7 percent of the total potentia l cone crop  was lost to all causes during the 1974-75 growing season at the  Ouachita Orchard, Mt. Ida, Arkansas. The following were agents  causing losses: tip moths, 45.2%; coneworms, 5%; unknown insects,  7. 9%; abortion, 20 . 5%; missing, 11 .1%; and other, 3.0%.  At the Stuart Orchard, Louisiana, during 1975, 75% of the  first year flowers were lost due to all causes on shortleaf pines,  47% on l oblolly pines , 65% on slash pines, and 80% on longl eaf pines .  Coneworms were the greatest single identifiable agent causing  . .  7  flower l oss (1.3% on shortleaf, 11 .6% on loblolly, 27% on slash,  and 14.7% on longleaf).  Both of these evaluations were part of a southwide cooperative  test by the Seed Orchard Sampling Committee.  An impact study on loblolly pine trees 30 feet tall at the  Stuart Orchard, Louisiana, showed significantly fewer tip damage by  tip moth on a heavy fertilized area 1 (9.3%) than on the check area 2  (31 .8%) at the 5% level of confidence. Coneworm damage to first  year flowers was 3.1% on heavi ly ferti l ized areas and 11.6% on check  areas.  4. Control  (Hertel - louisiana)  A fie ld test was conducted during 1974 using 28, 56, 112, and  224 g of FuradariiD (10% granules) per inch d.b.h. for tip moth control  on shortleaf pines (4 feet to 20 feet ta l l) at the Stuart Orchard,  Louisiana. The above rates were applied with one application (in  Febraury) and with two applications (once in February and once in  June) for a total of nine treatments, including the chec k.  The rates of 56, 112, and 224 g/2.5 em d.b.h. afforded good  shoot protection from tip moth attack with one appli cation (10%,  9%, and 3.5% damaged tips, respectively, as compared to 51% for check  trees). All treatments were significantly better than the check.  The 56 g rate applied once was as good as all higher rates.  A field test us ing FuradaiTID (10% granular) disked in during  February at the rates of 112, 224, and 336 grams per 2.5 em of tree  diameter on shortleaf pine trees (20 to 30 feet tall) was conducted  at the Stuart Seed Orchard during 1975. Only the 336 gram treatment  gave adequate protection of the top 20 vegetative shoots from t ip moth  attack. Approximately 70% of the shoots were attacked on check trees  and 9% on the 336 g treatment trees.  l!Treated with 270 kilograms (600 lbs) per acre of 12-12-12  fertilizer on March or April from 1972 through 1975.  ~Treated with 130 kilograms (285 lbs) of 12-12-12 fertilizer  in April 1975 and 230 kilograms (500 lbs) per acre in August 1975.  8  DiSystonÂ® applied in t1arch 1975 at the rate of 70 g of 15%  granules per 2.5 em d. b.h. and watered in was effective in protecting  the 20 topmost shoots of shortleaf pines from tip moth attack at the  Ouachita Seed Orchard, Mt. Ida, Arkansas, until August (7% shoot  attack vs . 29.5% for check trees); however, protection was reduced  by October (37% shoot attack vs. 67% on check trees).  (Neel and Jones - Mississippi)  Our work in 1975 consisted of repeating a carbofuran lOG method  of applicati on study begun the previous year. Sl ash pine trees in the  Scott Paper Company Seed Orchard were treated as fol l ows: control -Â­no  insecticide; band --8 oz/inch DBH; broadcast (1) --8 oz/inch DBH;  broadcast (2) --1 6 oz/inch DBH; drill --8 oz/inch DBH. The carbofuran  treatments were split applications; one- half the total insecticide  per tree was applied on April 4, and one-half was applied on June 6.  Fi ve clones were used with 1 ramet/clone in each treatment (5 trees).  Second-year cones in the 4 treatment groups attacked by V~a~yctnia  in 1975 followed a pattern similar to that in 1974. Cones in the  broadcast and drill treatments sustained less than 5% damage. Cones  from the banded trees were infested only at a slightly higher rate  (1 6.1% in 1975 vs. 15.1% in 1974). Cones in the control treatment  were more heavily infested than in 1974 (30.5% in 1975 vs. 19% in 1974).  The band treatments were obviously less effective than the broadcast  or drill tr2atments .  We found that 28% of the conelets tagged early in 1974 had  been des troyed by V.to~yc;t'Ua spp. by the end of 1975. \~ e had noted  that conelet protection in 1974 and al l 3 application methods had been  exceptionally good . Results of conelet protection from V~o~yc:tJUa spp.  in 1975 is not known since no conelets were tagged at the beginning  of this year.  The mean seed yield per cone was considerably less in the  control treatment than in any of the carbofuran treatments (1974 test).  The percent empty seed (5.9%) was noticeably less in the broadcast  (16 oz) rate than in any of the other treatments. The number of seed  destroyed by seedbugs was about 3 times as great in the control as it  was in any of the other treatment groups. (Note: Seed yield data  and cone bug damage results were obtained from analyses conducted by  DeBarr and his group at the Forestry Sciences Laboratory, Athens, Ga. )  An evaluation of carbofuran granules for coneworm control applied  to 17- to 18-year-old slash pine trees Â·(Scott Paper Company) was also  made in 1975. V~o~yctnia spp. control on 2nd-year cones from these  trees was 1ess effective than from carbofuran applications made to  younger trees in this same orchard.  &lt; 'â€¢  9  (Cameron - Texas )  As part of a southwide study directed by Gary DeBarr, one  soi l application of 10% granular carbofuran was applied at 3 rates  in the spring of 1975 to both a slash and l oblolly pine seed orchard.  The cones harvested from treated and control trees are being analyzed  for insect damage.  (Goyer and Nachod - Louisiana)  Results of 2 years of pilot trials on 4-acre blocks with carboÂ­furan  granular systemic insecticide showed that insect-caused losses  were reduced in all treatment rates and application schedules tested.  The February l application date of 4 oz. formulation (l OG) per inch  of tree diameter reduced losses from 28% to 7% over the 18-month  period of flower development.  (Copony and Tigner - Virginia)  Caging studies showed that FuradanÂ® at a rate of 8 ounces per  diameter inch \1/as effective against Le.ptogf.o.o.ow., c.oJtc.uf.w., when  appli ed early in the year. Survival of bugs in July and August averÂ­aged  3% on trees treated with FuradanÂ® in February. Survival on unÂ­treated  trees was 78% during the same period. Radiographs showed that  bugs fed upon cones of treated and untreated trees at roughly the same  rate (i.e . , about one seed per bug-day). Late;- treatJr,2t!'\'s ir: June C&lt;nd  July had no effect upon surv i val. Tests will continue in 1976 to corÂ­roborate  this year 's results, to evaluate other times and rates of  application, and to determine duration of effectiveness .  (Hedlin - B. C., Canada)  Anthio, Cygon and Samibark were applied as sprays (2% and 4%  active ingredient in water) to infested trunks. Results were negati ve  for all insecticides. Trials are currently under way us ing tanglefoot  on graft unions in an attempt to prevent damage.  Use of Vapona strips in bags which were on conelet-bearing twigs  was not effective in preventing damage by BaJtba.~ta c.ot0axiana. Eggs  were laid on the conelets prior to bagging.  (Lantz - Georgia)  Before I left Oklahoma State University, we set up a study to  evaluate blacklight traps as a population control method for conemoths-Â­primarily  VioJtyc.tJtia species. This study will be carried out throughout  the 1976 growing season. I am hopeful that some positive results will  emerge!  10  (Yearian - Arkansas)  Carbofuran was tested on 5 clones in the Arkansas Forestry  Commission loblolly pine seed orchard near Bluff City. Granular  and flowable materials were appli ed at rates of 0.025, 0.050, and  0. 100 lbs actual carbofuran per inch DBH in a single application  within the dripline of each tree. Results indicated that carbofuran  reduced coneworm damage, with some clonal and intraclonal differences.  (DeBarr and Nord - Georgia) Insecticide Screening  Thirty-two insecticides have been screened against the leaffooted Â·  pine seedbug, L eptogio~~U6 eoneuiU6, 2nd instar nymphs and adults.  Topical applications were used to develop dosage-mortality curves and  determine the median lethal dose (LD5o). The most promi sing insecticides  will be evaluated in a program of additional laboratory and field tests.  Â®  (DeBarr - Georgia) Southwide Furadan Seed Orchard Test  During 1974, tests were conducted in 11 seed orchards across the  Southeast utili zing more than 800 trees. In 1975, new tests were  initiated in 20 additional seed orchards while observations were  conti nued en tre~s in the 1974 tests. These tests are very rigo~o~~ . . Â·  because orily a few trees are treated in l arge blocks of untreated treei . .  General conclusions about the effectiveness of FuradanÂ® based upon 1974  and 1975 test results are as foll ows :  1 . FuradanCfi) i s superior to ThimetÂ® for contro 11 i ng coneworms  and seedbugs, based upon comparative tests in individual seed orchards.  2. Coneworm control with FuradarfiD vo~as fair to excellent in 1974,  but some tests were installed late. In the 1975 tests, all applications  were made in February and coneworm control was excellent.  3. FuradanÂ® provided excel l ent control of seedbugs; treatments  doubled and tripled the yields of filled seed .per cone from 1974 test  trees, even though the cones were protected only during the second  year of strobili growth.  4. FuradanÂ® controll ed coneborers, Eueo~ma, on Virginia pine.  5. On white pine, cone beetles killed 92% of the cone croQ on  the check trees while only 3% of the cones were lost on FuradarliD treated  trees.  6. Single applications were generally equal to or better than  split applications, i.e., it proved better to put all the insecticide  on at once rather than dividing the material and applying it on two  or three application dates.  11  7. The 8 oz./inch of DBH dosage rate generally proved better than  t he 4 oz./inch of DBH, but the increased increment in seed production  may not be great enough to justify the doubl ed cost.  8. Two successive annual applications of FuradariiD s igni f i cantly  increased survival of the cone crop. As an example, in one orchard  15% of the crop on the check trees survived, while nearly 90% of the  crop on the treated t rees survived.  9. There appears to be little or no carryover control of coneworms  from a single appl ication of FuradarfiD from the previous year .  10. No foli ar phytotoxi city was observed at the 4 or 8 oz. rates .  Some needle burning occurred on the needle tips at the 16 oz . rate.  In specific phytotoxicity tests, 32 ozs. of Â·FuradanÂ® l OG per i nch of  DBH caused moderate needle burning on some clones. In extensive seed  germination t est s involving thousands of seed , we detected no depression  of full seed germi nation or any increase in the number of abnormal  seedlings in samples of seed from trees treated with Furada.riiD.  Furadan is not the panacea for seed orchard insect probl ems.  Some of the more obvious disadvantages include :  l . The material is expensive, but relat ive to the only insectici de  registered for seed orchard use, Guthi onÂ®, the cos ts are compar abl e.  2. Soil sys tem~c s requi re t~e proper rainfall pattern i~ orde~  to work effectively .  3. Carbama t es are very toxic to v1ildlife . Furadar,Â® is extremely  toxi c t o bi r ds ; t herefore , i t mu st be i ncorporated into the soil .  FMC, the manufacturer, is very eager to expand the FuradanÂ® l abel  for seed orchard use. The EPA requires a minimum of t wo years of fie ld  testi ng . Both our 1974 and 1975 test results show the effectiveness  of FuradariiD for coneworm and seedbug control. This should be su fficie nt  efficacy data to support a request for regi stration . Data on phytoÂ­t  oxicity in terms of fo liar burning with 4X and 8X rat es and effect  on seed germinati on have al so been col l ected .  The manufacturer believes thatÂ· a minimum of three months wil l  be required once the request for a registration expansion has been  submitted . Optimistica l ly then, we can hope f or a r egi strat i on for the  1977 fie ld season.  12  5. Publications  Belcher, E. W., and G. L. DeBarr. 1975 .

General  (Merkel - Florida)  The forest insects research work unit at Olustee has been  reorganized into two major problem areas, i.e., (1) insects  affecting the production and quality of pine seed in the slash  pine ecosystem, and (2) bark beetles affecting naval stores and  lightwood production. Dr. Carl W. Fatzinger, Principal Research  Entomologist, has been designated team leader for problem (1),  and I'm b~ck on the bark beetles after a 20-year break--I've  almost forgotten what the little. critters look like! Working  under Carl are Isadore L. Williams, Jr., Entomologist, and  three technicians. I do, however, have a few cooperative studies  on cone and seed insects to complete and as Project Leader will  probably continue to bootleg some cone and seed insect research.  (Gibson - Ohio)  I am not currently actively engaged in seed-insect research,  so I have little to contribute to the newsletter.  I do have a manuscript that is at the FS editor. It is  titled ""Monograph of the genus Curculio in the New Horld (ColeÂ­optera:  Curculionidae) . Part II. Mexico and Central America.""  It will be about 26 pp. published. It covers all known species  (27) from that area. Of these, 18 are described as new species.  The distribution, hosts, and biologies are included when known.  1Contributions submitted by cone and seed insect research  workers, resource managers, and tree improvement specialists.  These unpublished data cannot be used without contributor's  approval. Items assembled by G. L. DeBarr, U.S . Forest Service,  Athens, Georgia.  (Goldman - Georgia)  International Paper Company, Southlands Experiment Forest,  has added to their staff an entomologist, Suzanne E. Goldman.  Studies planned for the 1977-1978 season include comparing the  effectiveness of GuthionÂ® and FuradanÂ® on seed orchard insect  control. FuradanÂ®will be tested operationally at various rates  and times of the year to determine the optimum treatment rate  and time.  (Schenk - Idaho)  Personnel: John A. Schenk  Shane D. Weber  David L. Kulhavy  Russell W. Clausen  New Projects: A project entitled ""The effect of shelterwood  cuttings on grand fir cone and seed production, and losses due  to insects in northern Idaho"" was initiated in late summer of  1976. The objectives of this project are to (1) ascertain the  response in cone and seed production of grand fir to two levels  (heavy/light) of shelterwood cuttings, and (2) compare insectÂ­caused  seed losses under the two logging treatments and under  undisturbed conditions. Verification and validation of a  prediction equation (Kulhavy and Schenk 1976) for estimating  grand fir cone crops from ground observations also will be done.  This research will be conducted by Shane Weber, Graduate Assistant  (M.S . degree) working with Schenk.  Continuing Projects: Russ Clausen, now a Research Associate  on two Douglas-fir tussock moth projects, is continuing (at a  much reduced pace) his work on the bioenergetic relations of the  cone and seed insects of Douglas-fir.  (Hertel - Louisiana)  I am now the staff entomologist coordinating Forest Insect  and Disease Management 's (USDA, Forest Service, Southeastern  Area, State and Private Forestry) seed orchard insect program.  Larry Barber (Asheville Field Office) and Neil Overgaard (Pineville  Field Office) will handle the seed orchard insect work in their  respective zones .  2  (Mattson - Minnesota)  While in France last September, I met a young French  entomologist, Dr. Alain Roques, who did his doctoral research  on insects affecting cone production in Pinus sylvestris. His  dissertation is titled ""Etude de la merocenose des canes de Pin  sylvestre en for@t de Fontainbleu"" and is roughly 175 pages in  length . It looks like an excellent piece of ecological research  that should be of general interest to ecologists, especially  those of us working with seed and cone insects. He investigated  such things as: (a) cone distributions; (b) insect impacts,  including cone life tables; (c) parasites of cone, shoot, and  gall insects; (d) insect life histories; and (e) rearing media  for cone insects.  Copies of this disseration may be obtained from Dr. Roques,  . whose address is: INRA - Centre de Recherches Foresti~rs,  Laboratoire de Zoologie et Biocenot ique Foresti~rs, ARDOM - 451 60 -  01 ivet, FRANCE.  In the next month, a Station Research Paper (NC-136) should  be out on ""The distribution of the cone insect, Dioryatria disaZusa ,  in red pine.""  (Stevens - Colorado)  Our work on the seed and cone insect complex in Engelmann  spruce has been completed and is being written up for publication.  Work has been started on the insect complex found in lodgepole  pine and subalpine fir cones. All work is being conducted on  the Fraser Experimental Forest in central Colorado.  2. Insect Identification and Biology  (Williams and Merkel - Florida)  We've finally encountered a potentially serious cone midge  problem on slash pine in a seed orchard in Nassau County. SecondÂ­instar  larvae have thus far been identified by Dr. R. Gagn~ (USNM)  as Ceaidomyia, possibly r esiniaola (O.S . ). We hope to obtain  adults in January-February 1977 for identification. Eggs are  apparently laid on or near the female strobili soon after pollination  and larvae feeding in the scale tissue (not the seeds) produce  grotesque, swollen scales. At this date, it does not appear that  infested cones will open to produce seed even if cones mature.  3  (Hedlin -British Columbia)  Pheromone studies -- laboratory and field studies on  Barbara colf axiana and Laspeyresia youngana were continued.  In field tests it was shown that male Barbara moths are  strongly attracted to 98/2 trans/cis isomer ratios of 9-  dodecen-1-01. Male L. youngana moths are attracted to a  similar trans/cis isomer ratio of 7-dodecen-1-01. A range  of synthetic chemicals tested against L. piperana did not  give positive results.  Douglas-fir flowers were collected in the spring of 1976  and were freeze dried to obtain volatile materials.  Dr. I. Weatherston, Sault Ste. Marie, will separate materials  for lab. and possibly field testi ng as possible sources of  attraction to female B. colfaxiana.  Cone collections were made from 165 Douglas-fir clones in  seed orchards. Cones were examined for insect attack and seed  loss, and data are being analyzed .  (Goyer - Louisiana)  The seasonal attack periods and role of insects destructive  to loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) cones and seeds in Louisiana  seed orchards were studied from August 1974 to October 1976.  Fine mesh nylon screen cages were used to exclude insects  and determine the seasonal attack periods for (l) cone-feeding  insects: coneworms, Dioryctria disclusa (Heinrich), D. clarioralis  (Walker) and D. amateZZa (Hulst); cone midges, ResseZieZZa and  Asynapta sp.; and (2) seed-feeding insects: Leptoglossus corculus  (Say) and Tetyra bipunctata (H. & S.) from August 1974 to  September 1976 at the DeRidder Seed Orchard.  D. amatella was found to have four peak attack periods  annually: one in spring, two in summer, one 'in fall. Moth  flight activity monitored by blacklight traps, and seasonal  development of larvae as found in supplemental cone collections  from August 1975 to September 1976, were in accordance with the  seasonal attack periods of D. amatella ascertained in the  exclusion study.  Cone midges were found damaging several second-year cones  but were found more commonly in association with cones damaged  by D. amatella . Conelet abortions were not concurrent with  peak attack periods of cone midges, coneworms or seedbugs.  4  Seedbug surveys conducted at orchards in Jonesboro, Bogalusa  and DeRidder revealed that populations varied with each locale  and from year to year. Intensive sampling of second-year coneÂ­bearing  branches at the DeRidder orchard in 1976 showed that the  incidence of seedbugs was highest in July and August. A comparison  of field survey data to radio~raphic analysis of seed losses  showed that most second-year ovule abortions occurred during the  period of rapid cone growth and with peak abundance of L. aorcutus.  T. bipunatata was found to be univoltine.  (Hertel and Overgaard - Louisiana)  A midge, Contarinia sp., causing needle droop and defoliation  to loblolly pines was first discovered at the Erambert Federal  Seed Orchard in Brooklyn, Mississi ppi, in 1971 . Since severe  dieback and defoliation associated with midge occurred in 1974,  a 100 percent ground survey was conducted to determine the extent  of the damage and the possible existence of certain clonal  preferences . The survey showed 30 percent of the trees in the  medium to heavy damage class in the south Mississippi loblolly  geographical seed source, 17 percent in the Alabama loblolly  seed source, and 5 percent in the north Mississippi loblolly seed  source. A statistical analysis showed a definite feeding pr eference  by the midge for certain clones. A study to determine larval feeding  periods showed that the midge feeds May through August, with major  feeding peaks in June and July.  Midge populations increased f rom 1971 when CyganÂ® (dimethoate)  was first applied until 1974 when severe defoliation occurred.  Midge populations collapsed and the trees showed a complete  recovery from the previous year 's defoliation with the disconÂ­tinued  use of CyganÂ® during the 1975 season . Therefore, this  insecticide is suspected as playing a role in causing midge  outbreaks .  (Copony - Virginia)  We have just about completed our evaluation of seed losses  of the 1975-76 cone crop in our loblolly seed orchard. The  study included all losses from flower closure to cone harvest.  We compared cone and seed yields from protected and unprotected  trees.  Losses amounted to 73 .3% of the total seed potential with  insect-cause-d losses amounting to 37. 2%. Seedbug damage duringÂ·  the first year of con~ development was the largest single loss  factor (26.4%).  5  (Tigner - Virginia)  Other data indicate that FuradanÂ®might have residual  effectiveness against Dioryctria (but not Leptoglossus ) the  year following application. This possibility will be reÂ­examined  in 1977.  3. Damage  (Cameron - Texas)  An impact study was conducted in a high wood density  loblolly seed orchard near Magnolia Springs, Texas, as part of  a southwide cooperative test . Preliminary results revealed 31.4%  of the 1~74-75 conelets and cones were lost to all causes; 12.5%  of the losses were directly attributed to insects. The surviving  cones contained an average of 98.2 seeds, 64.1% of which were  full. Cones from the same trees protected in cages throughout  the second year of development yielded an average of 98.0 seeds  per cone, 71.0% of which were full. Additional data is currently  being collected for the 1975-1976 cone crop .  (Copony and Tigner - Virginia)  We are continuing to refine our use of FuradanÂ®for control  of cone and seed insects in the Divisionâ€¢s loblolly pine seed  orchard. By the end of 1977, data from cone analyses and field  bioassays should provide a reasonable basis for calculating  economic thresholds under various conditions of crop size,  application rate, and length of protection. In addition, we  hope to determine if treatment can be put off until after the  greatest danger of frost. Results to date show that application  can be delayed at least until mid-April.  4. Control  (Fatzinger - Florida)  OrtheneÂ® is presently being tested for control of cone and  seed insects on slash pine in the McColskey Still Seed Orchard  near Lake City, Florida. The treated trees were sprayed during  the second week of January 1976 and again during the last weeks  of February and June with OrtheneÂ® spray solution containing  6  1 kg. AI/210 1. of water. Preliminary results indicated that  the insecticide was effective in controlling cone-destroying  insects. The effect on thrips attacks was not directly measured  during the first 3 months of the study, but the untreated trees  had only 66 percent as many conelets in April as did the treated  trees. At cone harvest in October 1976, i.e., six months after  the initial conelet counts were made in April 1976, the treated  trees had retained 92 percent of their second-year cones and  91 percent of their first-year conelets, whereas the untreated  trees had retained only 86 percent of their second-year cones  and 79 percent of their first-year conelets. Insects were  responsible for most of the losses incurred on the untreated  trees.  {Cameron - Texas)  A 10-acre block of 12- to 14-year-old high wood density  slash pin~ seed orchard trees was treated 5 times at monthly  intervals with GuthionÂ® in 1975 and an adjacent 10-acre block  was left untreated. These blocks yi elded 497 and 501 lbs of  cleaned seed, respectively, in 1975. Both areas were treated  5 times in 1976. The block treated 2 consecutive years yielded  667 lbs of cleaned seed in 1976 and the block treated during  1976 only yielded 272 lbs of seed. This strongly suggests that  the greatest amount of seedbug and coneworm damage occurred  during the first year of cone development.  {Neel and Lambert -Mississippi)  A comparison of two methods of application of carbofuran  granules was made in a Mississippi slash pine seed orchard.  Applications of 8 oz/in DBH by a Gandy fertilizer spreader  {GANDY), followed by light disking, was compared to the same  rate of application by a zip seeder, ZF-6 (ZIP). Periodic  observations of the tagged cones and conelets {10%) showed  that the percentage of 2nd-year cones killed by Dior yotria spp.  was: GANDY, 2; ZIP, 1.8 and CONTROL, 6.6; the percentage of  2nd-year cones damaged was: GANDY, 42.9; ZIP, 51.8 and CONTROL,  76.9 . The percentage of 1st-year cones killed by Di oryotria spp.  was GANDY, 0.8; ZIP, 2.8 and CONTROL, 1.8; the percentage of  1st-year cones damaged by this insect was GANDY, 59; ZIP, 50.2  and CONTROL, 47.8.  An analysis of sound and damaged seed from 2nd-year cones  to determine the effect of carbofuran granule applications on  seedbug control has not been completed.  7  In summary, this study showed no difference in degree of  Dioryatria control between Gandy spreader and Zip seeder methods  of carbofuran applications. A noticeable reduction of damage  to 2nd-year cones v1as apparent. The carbofuran applications had  little or no beneficial effect in protecting 1st-year cones from  Dioryatria damage.  (Mehary and Cade - Washington)  Pilot studies to test selected chemicals for the control  of the Douglas-fir coneworm, Dioryatria abietivoreZZa Grote,  were tested during 1976 at a Weyerhaeuser seed orchard in  northwest Oregon. Two separate studies were initiated and  aligned to flower availability .  Study I. Treatments consisting of FuradanÂ®granules,  FuradanÂ® spray and control were each applied  to a single ramet of 8 clones.  Study II . Treatments consisting of Orthene, dimethoate  Guthion, Lindane and control each applied to  2 ramets of 4 clones .  FuradanÂ® granules of 10 percent active ingredient at the rate  of 6 ounces per inch of tree diameter were applied in early April.  The other 5 insecticides were applied in spray form at concentraÂ­tions  of 0.5 percent active ingredient by a mist blower from a  lift truck until foliage wetness. The spray applications were  made in the middle of May, June and July.  Data analysis on cones collected in September is in progress;  however, avai lable data indicates that seed and cone insect  infestations were low for 1976. A brief summary of the data is  given in Table 1.  The FuradanÂ®granules are comparatively ineffective because  the April application was too late for proper translocation of  the systemic insecticide in time to achieve control.  Though Dioryatria infestation was low in 1976, this insect  is known to occur sporadically and is capable of causing  considerable damage.  8  TABLE 1. 1976 Summary of Dioryctria Cone Damage  Treatment  Study I  No. of  Clones  Furadan (Spray) 7  Furadan (Granules) 8  Control 7  Study II  Dimethoate  (Cygon)  Guthion  Lindane  Orthene  Control  Total  4  4  4  4  3  12  No. oÂ£  Ramets1  7  8  8  8  7  7  5  3  53  No. Observed  Cones  641  1,307  547  1,129  721  710  253  124  5,432  % Dioryctria  Damage  0.31  3.21  5.67  0.18  0.0  0.56  0.0  8.07  1some r amets were exclude d because of i nherent incompatibility and  due to cone population less than t he minimum 30.  (Flavell - Montana)  Shortly after arriving in Missoula, I had a request from the  Clearwater National Forest for a method to control the mountain pine  cone beetle, Conophthorus monticolae Hopk., in western \'lhite pine seed  production areas. Scott Tunnock and I designed a small field test of  carbofuran which was 11 put in11 by Scott and Gerald Franc, forester on  the Clearwater. Gerry assumed major responsibility for all the fieldÂ­work  since Scott and I were tied up with a budworm pilot project.  The test was done in a relatively young stand of white pine (30  to 70 feet tall) which \&gt;Jas moderately to heavily infested by the cone  beetle. Carbofuran was placed in holes distributed evenly within the  area from trunk to drip line around each tree. After consultation with  Gerry, we tried three dosage rates--12, 16, and 24 ounces-- of the 10-  gram formulation per inch of diameter. Five trees were treated with  each rate.  Unfortunately, the results showed there was no treatment effect.  Cones are now being analyzed for carbofuran residue by the Insecticide  Evaluation Project in Berkeley, California. Since carbofuran .is the only  insecticide to have shown promise for c~aophthorus sp., we are also  sponsoring some screening tests to determine if it is effective on the  western species.  9  (Merkel - Florida)  With the help of the University of Florida Forest Tree  Improvement Cooperative, we are attempting to obtain EPA  approval of a State of Florida label for the use of malathion  to control the slash pine flower thrips, Gnophot hrips fu scus  (Morgan). This will be an interesting test case since experiÂ­mental  data on efficacy is very limited. Researchers in other  states may ~tlish to try a similar approach.  (Hertel and Overgaard - Louisiana)  Several field tests and operatiqnal projects for tip moth  control were conducted using FuradanÂ® (carbofuran), CyganÂ®  (dimethoate), and Di-SystonÂ® (disulfoton) on ~horÂ·tleaf and/or  loblolly pines during 1974 and 1975. FuradanÂ®was tested on  shortleaf ~ pines at the Stuart Seed Orchard, Louisiana in 1974  and 1975. In 1975, operational projects using CyganÂ® on loblolly  pines at the Stuart Orchard and CyganÂ® and Di -SystonÂ® on shortÂ­leaf  pines at the Ouachita Seed Orchard, Arkansas were monitored.  In addition to the above, an evaluation was conducted of the  incidence of tip moth damaqe on heavily fertilized loblolly  pines at the Stuart Orchard in 1975.  The field test at Stuart Orchard during 1974 using FuradanÂ®  (10 percent granular) on shortleaf pines (4.27 m = 14' tall) once  (February) and twice (February and June) showed that rates of 56,  112, and 224 g/2.5 em (2 , 4, and 8 oz/in) d.b.h., applied once  gave good protection to tips through September. There were no  significant differences amonq the three rates. Neither 28 q  (1 oz) rate was effective (effective = reduction of tip damage  &lt;10 percent). Double applications were not superior to single  applications. No residual tip protection ~t/as shown by a June  1975 evaluation of test plots, except for the 224 g (applied twice)  treatment.  The field test during 1975 at the Stuart Orchard using FuradanÂ®  (10 percent granular) at the rates of 112, 224, and 336 g/2.5 em  (4, 8, and 12 oz/in) d.b.h. on shortleaf pines 8.5 m (26 ft) in  height showed that only the 336 g treatment gave adequate tip  protection from tip moth attack. None of the treatments were  effective in protecting conelets from tip moth damage.  Cygan&lt;& (3.5 ml/l = 4 pts/100 gal of water) applied operationally  in three applications as a drench spray was ineffective in protecting  conelets or tips on lobl olly pines at the Stuart Orchard and was  only partially effective in protecting shortleaf pine tips at the  Ouachita Orchard. The reason for the failures was considered to be  the fact that sor:1e spray applications \'tere missed.  10  Di-SystonÂ® {.15 percent granular) applied in March 1975 at  the rate of 70 g/2.5 em (2.5 oz/in) d.b.h. was four times more  effective than the control in protecting shortleaf pine tips  from tip moth attack at the Ouachita Orchard according to an  August evaluation; however, protection was reduced to two times  the control by October. It, as \'fell as CygonÂ®, gave some evidence  of protecting conelets from tip moth attack. However, signifiÂ­cantly  more conelets were lost due to other factors on CygonÂ®  treated trees.  The heavy fertilization treatment (109.3 kg/ha = 600#/acre)  showed significantly fewer damaged tips (9.3 percent) than the  control (.31.8 percent).  (Hertel and Barber - Louisi ana)  Forest Insect and Disease Management, Southeastern Area,  State and Private Forestry is conducting a pilot test during  1977-1978 using a John Deere Pow'r Till SeederÂ® for applying  FuradanÂ® lOG for seed and cone insect control. The main objecÂ­tive  of the study is to determine if the seeder adequately  incorporates FuradanÂ® gÂ·r'anules so as to minimi ze bird mortality.  The second objective is to determi ne if FuradanÂ® applied by this  method at the registered dosage rate is effective for controlling  seed and cone insects in southern pine seed orchards.  The test will be applied to a 30-acre block each in two  loblolly pine seed orchards in Lou isiana, one l oblolly pine seed  orchard each in Mississippi and South Carolina, and one slash  pine orchard in Florida during January-February 1977.  Effectiveness of incorporation of granules will be determined  by applying blank flourescent granules prior to the actual test  to a sample row of trees in each orchard and counting the number  of granules not incorporated in a 3"" x 12"" area near each of  l 0 trees.  For determination of the effects of the treatment on bird  populations, the 30-acre block in each orchard will be searched  under supervision of U.S . Fish and Wildlife personnel one day prior  to and 1, 2, 3 and 5 days post treatment for dead birds and  identification of birds utilizing the area.  Efficacy data will be collected by making post season cone  insect damage counts on two ramets of six selected clones in each  FuradanÂ® Pow'r Till treated, FuradanÂ® hand treated, and untreated  areas in each orchard. To assess seedbug damage, seeds from caged  and uncaged cones on sample trees will be extracted and x-rayed by  11  the Eastern Tree Seed Laboratory, Macon, Georgia. In addition,  10 percent of the conelets and cones will be tagged and monitored  monthly on sample ramets as above for a two-year period in two  federal orchards. The same treatment will be applied to sample  trees in these orchards in January-February 1978 . The study shou ld  be completed by October 1978.  (DeBarr and Nord - Georgia)  Second-stage nymphs of the leaffooted pine seedbug, Leptoglossus  corculus (Say), were highly susceptible to most of the 32 candidate  insecticides included in our contact toxicity tests. Twenty-four  chemicals had LD50 dosage levels of less than 5 micrograms/gram  of body weight in topical applications. In decreasing order of  toxicity, aminocarb, monocrotophos, carbofuran, azinphosmethyl,  aldicarb, dicrotophos, and propoxur ki lled 90 percent of test insects  at a dosage level of less than l microgram/gram of body weight.  There was ' good agreement between the relative toxicity of insectiÂ­cides  applied topically to the l eaffooted pine seedbug in laboratory  tests and the effectiveness of several insecticides previously  tested in the field.  (DeBarr -Georgia)  In the early 1970's, tree improvement workers and seed orchard  managers were hampered by the almost complete lack of registered  insecticides for use in seed orchards. Forest entomologists had  shown that insects often destroy more than half the seed crop in  orchards across the South. Applied controls were sorely needed,  but none were available.  In September 1972, an ad hoc committee called the Southern  Seed Orchard Pest Committee1Was-Drganized. The members of this  committee had recognized that only through a united effort would  it be possible to collect the extensive efficacy data required by  the Environmental Protection Agency and register commercial  insecticides for use in seed orchards.  Our first chairman was Loyd Drake, an entomologist with State  and Private Forestry. Bob Heir, North Carolina State University,  assumed the role of chairman in 1974. Other members and the agency  or interest they represent included:  Larry Barber, U.S. Forest Service, State and Private Forestry;  Paul Barnett, Tennessee Valley Authority;  Dr. Halter Beers, University of Florida Tree Improvement  Cooperative;  12  Terrell Brooks, states not in coooeratives;  Tom Flavell, USFS, State and Private Forestry;  Dr. William Neel, university forest entomologists;  William Tuttle, U.S. Forest Service, Reqion 8;  Dr. Hans van Buijtenen, Western Gulf Tree Improvement  Cooperative;  and myself, U.S. Forest Service, Southeastern Forest  Experiment Station.  The first task our committee undertook was to obtain efficacy  data to support an extension of the registration for GuthionÂ®,  which was limited to slash pine orchards. Dr. Lawrence Abrahamson,  pesticide specialist with the USFS, assisted the committee in this  effort. In 1974 the EPA registered GuthionÂ® for coneworm control  on all species of southern pines.  Even before the GuthionÂ® registration had been extended, we  set out to find an alternative for GuthionÂ®. We felt that finding  a substitute for GuthionÂ® was of major importance because of its  high toxicity and the necessity for 3 to 5 GuthionÂ® applications  each year. Carbofuran (FuradanÂ® ) had shown promise for coneworm  control in several 1973 research tests and was less hazardous when  absorbed through the skin. The committee decided that testing  should be initia ted using a standardized study plan designed to  evaluate the effectiveness and phytotoxicity of FuradanÂ® in  southern pine seed orchards.  Cooperators installed tests in 11 seed orchards in 1974, and  in 1975 the Southwide FuradanÂ® tests were expanded with 19  additional orchards. In late March 1976, I completed the summary  and analysis of data from two years of testing. Chairman Weir  forwarded these data to the manufacturer, and by mid April, FMC  had applied for an amended registration of FuradanÂ® lOG granules  to control coneworms, seedbugs, coneborers, and the white pine  cone beetle in seed orchards. In late July 1976, almost 4 years  after the formation of the Southern Seed Orchard Pest Committee,  the EPA registered FuradanÂ® for seed orchard use. The tentatively  approved label reads as follows :  Directions for Use: Southern pine seed orchards for  control of seedbugs, coneworms, and coneborers. Use  FuradanÂ® lOG granules at 4 to 8 ounces per inch of  tree diameter. Broadcast within the drip area of the  tree and incorporate with a suitable device. Make 1  application in winter or early spring. In white pine  seed orchards for the white pine cone beetle, use FuradanÂ®  lOG granules at 8 ounces per inch of tree diameter. Do Â·  not graze or feed orchard plants or plant parts.  13  5. Publications  Barber, L. R. 1976.

February 1981  1. r.eneral  Your compilor is pleased to announce that his plea for a successor  was answered and that the CONE &~ SEED INSECT NEWSLETTER will for the  next 3 years be assembled by Scott Cameron, Texas Forest Service, Lufkin.  Thanks to those of you who volunteered to take the job ever, and also  to all of you who continue to share your results with the rest of us  each year. The NEWSLETTER has, in these increasingly structured times,  an informal quality that hopefully will continue.  A pest management workshop will be conducted at the 16th Southern  Forest a~d Tree Improvement Conference at Virginia Polytechnic Institute  and State University at Blacksburg on May 27-28, 1981. For further  information, contact the workshop moderator, Harry 0. Yates III, at  Athens, Georgia.  The IUFRO Cone and Seed Insects t-Torking Party S2. 07-01 will be  meeting at the XVII IUFRO World Congress in Kyoto, Japan, from 3-19  September 1981.  (Yates, SEFES, Athens, GA)  ,  Seed orchard managers from private and public land ownerships have  formed the Northwest Seed Orchard Managers' Association. This new  organization will operate in western Washington, western Oregon, and  northern California. Functions of the association are:  (1) Â·To provide a forum for informational exchange among  orchard managers.  (2) To identify research needs, and to set priorities for  orchard research.  (3) To function as a clearinghouse for specific orchard  problems.  (4) To represent orchard managers in lobbying efforts, with  specific applicat~on to problems of chemical registration  and equipment development.  1contri butions submitted by persons working with cone a~d seed insects,  assembled and lightly edited by Robert Stevens, Rocky Mtn .

Neil will be working on  hardwood insects and southern pine beetle.  (Overgaard, USFS, Alexandria, LA)  Lester Gibson is again actively working with acorn insects under  a study concerned with the impact of insects on oak regeneration in the  Northeastern U.S. and Appalachian areas. The study will be mainly with  red oak and white oak.  (Gibson, NEFES, USFS, Delaware, OH)  The studies on synthetic attractants for Barbara colifaxiana and  Cydia (=Laspeyresia) youngana initiated by Al Redlin are being continued  by his replacement, Gordon Miller. Mixtures of various ratios of cis-  9-dodecen-1-yl acetate and the corresponding alcohol were tested for  attractiveness to B. colifaxiana, the most attractive being 25:75 and  50:50 (acetate:alcohol). Studies to determine if these chemicals are  actual components of the sex pheromone (initial studies indicate they  are) will be carried out in Â·1981. Studies of the effects of trap c~lor; Â·  design and height on catches will also be carried out. The results of  the tests for attractiveness to ~Â· youngana were inconclusive. Hopefully,  some new materials will be available for testing L~ 1981 .  Results of field tests with flower extracts of Douglas-fir and white  spruce against their respective pests were inconclusive. Tests will  be carried out again in 1981 but only with spruce.  Plans for 1981 include studies on the identification of the pheromones  of Contarinia oregonensis and Dioryctria spp.  (Miller, Pacific For. Res. Center, Victoria, B.C. )  Related work is underway south of the border under a new  cooperative research venture between Weyerhaeu~er Co . and the U.S.  Forest Service to identify the sex pheromones of Dioryctria spp.  infesting Douglas-fir cones.  (Daterman, Pac. N.W. For. Expt. Sta., Corvallis)  3  A laboratory colony of the blister coneworm, Dioryctria clarioralis ,  was established in Texas during 1979 and SQrtinued through 1980 . More  than 550 males were cap~ured in Phercon 1~ traps baited with unmated  female moths. The calling time of female moths was observed in laboratory  experiments and time of male capture in traps baited with females was  monitored in the field. The major components of the QÂ· clarioralis  pheromone were isolated and identified . More than 350 D. clarioralis  males and 190 D. merkeli males were caught during 1980 in traps baited  with synthetic pheromones .  Flight periods of Q. clarioralis, D. amatella and D. merkeli have  been monicored in Texas with light craps for serveral years . Light  trap catches were collected at periodic intervals during several nights  to determine the time of response of Dioryctria spp. moths to light .  (Cameron, Texas For . Ser . , Lufkin)  A cooperative study between the Southwestern Region, USFS, Rocky  Mountain Station, and Northern Arizona University was begun in 1980  to study the insects associated with second year ponderosa pine cones  on the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests. Its objectives were to  determine the insects associated with the cones, the time when they  become associated with the cones, the percentage of cones infested with  each species and the percentage of seeds damaged per cone . In May,  cone bearing branches on trees in 4 locations (mostly on the Tusayan  District of the Kaibab National Forest) were bagged. Throughout the  summer, protected cones were unbagged every 2 weeks by Kevin Carlin,  research associate;l NAU, and Mike Wagner, forest entomology professor,  NAU. Simultaneously, groups of cones were collected for dissection and  rearing in the laboratory. At the end of August, the cones were collected.  Some are being dissected and x-rayed by the Southwestern Region. The  rest are being dissected by technicians at the Rocky Mountain Station.  Conophthorus ponderosae appears to be an important associate . One  curculionid and another unidentified species of beetle have been submitted  for identification. Seed chalcid larva have been found but no adults  have yet been reared. One lepidopterous larva has been found during  dissection . It is being compared against larval specimens of known  seed-damaging moths .  (Schmid, RM For. Expt. Sta., USFS, Ft. Collins,CO)  4  Sunil Ranasinghe has completed his field research on the slash  pine flower thrips, Gnophothrips fuscus (Morgan) , and will finish his  Ph.D. dissertation on this pest during spring 1981 .  Two new students, Kerry Sweckey and Alex Bustillo, are investigating  the use of Trichogramm wasps as egg parasites of Dioryctria spp. coneÂ­worms  in slash pine seed orchards.  The regional seed and cone insect projec~ (S-118) will be terminated  officially in September 1981, but it was decided that a group be formed  to meet with the S. Forest Insect Work Conference, beginning in August  1981 at Gainesville, Florida.  (Wilkinson, Univ. Florida)  2. Biology  Laboratory and field studies of the sex pheromones of QÂ· amatella,  D. disclusa and D. clarioralis were conducted during 1980. A bioassay  ~hamber adapted from Daterman's model was used to determine the response  curve for male D. amatella to crude female extract. This procedure  was also found ~seful for bioassaying fractions of crude female extracts.  High populations of D. disclusa were present .in several seed  orchards in the Southeast again this year. This provided us with the  opportunity to continue work on the sex pheromone of this species . About  4,000 infested cones were collected from an orchard in Georgia during  April. The larvae were set up on artificial diet and allowed to develop  at a constant temperature of 30Â° C. Moths were available for  electroantennogram (EAG) &tudies and bioassays in the laboratory about  2 weeks ahead of those from the field. Field tests conducted during  May and June confirmed that the single component found in the EAG studies  was attractive to males in loblolly pine orchards in Georgia, North  Carolina and Virginia. Thus, with a lot of cooperation and a few  hectic weeks of work, we were able to identify and field test the sex  pheromone of this univoltine species in a single season.  In addition, the sex pheromones for D. amatella and D. clarioralis .  were also identified and field tested in Georgia, South Carolina and  Texas. Two sex pheromone components were found for D. clarioralis, while  D. amatel~a appeared to use only a single compound.  Work planned for the coming year includes a Southwide survey for  D. disclusa using traps baited with synthetic sex pheromone, studies to  relate trap catches with population size and cone damage, and preliminary  trials of the use of the male disruption techniques for Dioryctria spp.  control in pine seed orchards.  (DeBarr, Berisford, Cameron, Roelfs, Barber,  and others, USFS and Univ . Georgia, Athens)  5  3. Damage  U.S. Forest Service entomologists in New Mexico sampled cones from  cone lots coming into the Albuquerque Tree Nursery to determine what  insect damage is occurring and what percent of the seed in the nursery  is lost as a result of insects. In addtion, Forest Pest Management, in  cooperation with Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station and  Northern Arizona University , established some preliminary plots in  Arizona. Second-year ponderosa pine cones were bagged to determine  what insects were attacking, when they attacked, and how much damage  resulted. A similar plot was established in Douglas-fir in New Mexico.  (Ragenovich, USFS, Albuquerque, NM)  Entomologists monitored cone and seed insects for the third year in  those seed production areas in Montana and northern Idaho that had  sufficient cones to allow sampling (33 areas). Cones of Douglas-fir,  grand fir, western larch, Engelmann spruce, western hemlock, lodgepole  pine, ponderosa pine, and western white pine were sampled at about  monthly intervals from June through mid- September. Results are being  analyzed. Greatest losses (50- 100 percent of the cones) occurred to  Douglas-fir and western larch in areas infested with the western spruce  budworm. Ver y heavy injury was inflicted to ponderosa pine cones by  Dioryctria spp . at one location in Montana, and the mountain pine cone  beetle continued to cause serious losses to western white pine cones in  northern Idaho.  (Dewey, USFS, Missoula, MT)  Cone and seed insects and low seed counts, presumably due to poor  pollination, impeded cone collections of Douglas-fir and interior spruces  in forest stands in B.C .â€¢ All other conifers sampled were relatively  free of cone and seed insects . Douglas-fir cones were unsuitable for  collection at 9/10 locations sampled in the Cariboo Forest Region; at  24/ 71 locations sampled in the Kamloops Forest Region; at 7/ 13 locations  sampled in the Vancouver Forest Region; and at 5/ 6 locations sampl~d  in the Nelson Forest Region. Damage to the cones was caused primarily  by Barbara colfaxiana, Contarinia oregonensis and Dioryctria spp .  Engelmann spruce cones were unsuitable for collection at 5/ 5 and 7/ 8  of the locations sampled in the Cariboo and Kamloops Forest Regions,  respectively . In the Prince Rupert Forest Region, white spruce cones  at 5/6 locations sampled were unsuitable for collection. The most  damaging spruce cone and seed insects were Cydia (Laspeyresia) youngana  and Lassioma (Hylemya) anthracina.  In Douglas-fir seed orchards on Vancouver Island, seed losses due to  cone and seed insects ranged from less than 10% to more than 90%. The  most damaging species were f Â· oregonensis , ! Â· colfaxiana, Dioryctria  spp. and Megastigmus spermotrophus. Leptoglossus occidentalis has been  visible in the orchards the last two years but damage by this insect has  not been quantified.  (Miller, Pacific For. Res. Center, Victoria, B.C.)  6  Records at the Placerville Nursery, U.S. Forest Service, indicate  that consignments of moderately to heavily infested cones comprised the  following proportions of the shipments: Douglas-fir, 57%; red fir,  43%; white fir, 38%; Jeffrey pine, 31%; ponderosa pine, 25%; sugar  pine, 7% . Nevertheless, cone crops generally were good in the Sierra  Nevada Mountains and seed losses did not hinder most collections. Yields  of seed per cone appeared to be better than in 1979.  The Douglas-fir cone crop at the Badger Hill Tree Breeding Arboretum,  El Dorado County, did not incur the serious losses found there in past  years. However, the cone moth, Barbara colfaxiana, and the cone midge,  Contarinia oregonensis, continued to cause serious losses at many  locations in Del Norte, Humboldt and Siskiyou Counties where the  unseasonal spring weather did not eliminate the Douglas-fir cone crop.  (Freeman, FPM, USFS , San Francisco, CA)  Larvae of an unkno~ species of looper destroyed about 25 percent of  the cunelet crop during the spring of 1979 in a loololly pine seed orchard  at Magnolia, Arkansas. A visit to the orchard on April 2, 1980 confirmed  that the larvae were again destroying female strobili (some still in the  twig- bud stage) . Our investigation of the distribution of the infestation  revealed the source of the infestation to be two isolated sweetgum trees  on the border of the orchar d. Thousands of looper larvae were present  in the male sweetgum flowers. Young larvae were dispersing into the  crowns of the orchard trees from the sweetgum flowers on long, silk  threads. The sweetgum trees were cut and removed.  (DeBarr and Bramlett, SEFES, USFS, Ather.s,GA)  An outbreak of Dioryctria disclusa in early spring 1980 essentially  eliminated our New Kent Co. loblolly seed orchard cone crop, and damaged  a significant portion of new conelets. A quickly organized aerial  treatment with azinphosmethyl treatments are planned for 1981.  (Tigner, Va. Div. Forestry, Charlottesvi~le)  1980 Collections of read oak acorns show that insect infestation  was 56% at a site near Binghamton, N. Y. and 40 to 59% in areas near  Ithaca, N. Y.  (Gibson, USFS, Delaware, OH)  7  4. Control  A study of the effectiveness of aerial vs . hydraulic sprayer  applications of acephate for control of cone and seed insects in a  slash pine seed orchard was installed in January, 1980 (C. W.  Fatzinger, H. 0 . Yates, III, and J . G. Hickman) . Three applications  of acephate were made to study plots : one in late- January, one in  late-February, and one in late-May. The aerial applications were made  with a fixed-wing airplane at the rates of 3.00- , 1.50-, and 0 . 75-lb.  a . i. in 20 gal. of water per acre. The hydraulic spray was applied  as a 0 . 5% a.i. solution to foliage drip off . The study includes an  untreated check area.  A late frost and an unusually high incidence of cone rust have  created problems in analysis of the first year's results. However  there were significant differences in treatments. The study will  be continued in 1981.  (Fatzinger, SEFES, USFS, Oluster, FL)  An aerial pilot test test for controlling cone and seed insects  in a loblolly pine seed orchard in Louisiana was conducted during  1980.  Guthion (2# a.i. / acre) and Pydrin (0.67# a.i. / acre) were each  applied in five monthly applications (May- September) by helicopter  to individual five acre blocks. Both treatments showed significantly  less coneworm damage than the check t reatment. Coneworm damage  was 38 percent in the check compared to 18 percent in both Guthi on  and Pydrin treatments . Numbers of sound seeds per cone were more  than doubled in both chemical treatments over the check. The t est  is to continue one more year.  A Furadan rate evaluation was conducted at the Ouachita Orchard,  Mt . Ida, Arkansas , comparing applications of 4 and 8 ounces of  Furadan/ in d . b. h. by the John Deere Pow'r till seeder and Guthion  (30 pi nt/ 100 gal. H20) by mist blower. All three treatments were  significantly better than the check for coneworm damage (46% for the  check v ersus 14% for Guthion, 6% for Furadan 4 oz . and 3% for Furadan  8 oz.) The mean number of sound seeds produced per cone was 5 in the  check, 35 in the Guthion treatment, 56 in the Furadan (4 or. ) treatment  and 63 in the Furadan (8 oz. ) treatment .  (Overgaard , USFS, Alexandria, LA)  Field tests of 3 insecticides--Pydrin, Ambush, and Imidan--were  continued in four pine seed orchards in 1980 (Table 1) . The objective  of this study was to determine t he efficacy and establish the minimum  effective rates of these insecti cides for control of seedbugs and  coneworms in southern pine seed orchards. The t reatments tested are  given in Table 2.  Randomizedcomplet~block designs were used with clones considered  to be blocks.

(Nord and DeBarr )  9  The insecticides were applied 5 times at monthly intervals (beginning in  April or May) with a hydraulic sprayer to the point of runoff. In the  Francis Marion test, 1.6-acre blocks of trees were sprayed 6 times at  monthly intervals (beginning April 10) with a large John Bean speedsprayer.  Several response variables relating to damage caused by seed bugs and  coneworms were measured.  Dioryctira Control. Both Pydrin and Ambush at all 3 rates gave good  control of coneworms in the Tar City orchard (Table 2) . There was no  significant differences at the 5% level between the Ambush, Pydrin and the  Guthion standard treatments. Imidan at .3% was significantly different  from Guthion. Although Imidan .3% was significantly less effective than  Ambush and Pydrin at the upper rate, it was not at the middle and lower  rates.  Efficacy of all insecticides was apparently lower in the Beauregard  orchard. Only the upper and middle rates of Ambush, the upper rate of  Pydrin, and the Guthion treatments had significantly less coneworm damage  than the control. There was no significant difference between those rates  of Ambush, Pydrin and Guthion. In the Erambert orchard, there was no  difference between the control treatments .  Control of Dioryctria disclusa was excellent with all three rates of  Pydrin in the Francis Marion orchard. Control of other Dioryctria was  moderately good, but there were no differences between rates. Control  of 1980 Q. disclusa damage in trees sprayed in the Georgia Kraft orchard  during 1979 was very good. Untreated trees had 27.9% damage while damage  in trees treated with Pydrin, Ambush, Imidan and Guthion ranged from 0 to  2.2%.  Seed Bug Control. Seed bug damage was at such a low level in 1980  that it is unlikely that any information on insecticide efficacy will be  obtained. In the 1979 tests, the results of which were not available at  press time last year, good control of seed bugs was indicated by all  insecticides and rates tested .  (Nord and DeBarr, SEFES, Athens, GA)  Prescribed burning tests were conducted in two New York locations  to determine their effects on acorn insect populations.  (Gibson, USFS, Delaware, OR)  10  The effects of a moderate intensity prescribed understory fire on cone  production and losses of cones and seed to insects in seral ponderosa pine  is currently being investigated near Tensed, Idaho. Sample trees were  located in an open stand (mean CCF = 46) with mature ponderosa pine comprising  over 90 percent of the total basal area per acre. Cones were sampled from  eight crown locations on each tree during late summer 1979 and 1980. The  burn was conducted in early fall 1979. To date Conophthorus ponderosae  Hopk. has been the only cone insect encountered in sampled cones. Preliminary  indications are that fire treatment was followed by a slight increase in  first year ovulate strobili production and a decline in the number of cones  attacked by fÂ· ponderosae. Final analysis of the data is in p~ogress and a  manuscript is in preparation.  (Johnsen & Schenk, Univ. Idaho, Moscow)  Encouraged by the results .of a single ground application of acephate  and carbaryl to protect Douglas-fir foliage and cones from western spruce  budworm damage, we used double and triple applications in 1980. To reduce  pre-spray damage (30 percent in 1979), the initial application was applied  12 days earlier this year. Additional applications were applied to prolong  the effective period of protection.  Treatment began May 8 at which time most of the cone buds were open and  erect. The remaining applications followed at approximately 17-day intervals.  Post-spray sampling included young cones, mature larvae, defoliation, and  mature cones. Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize the data tabulated to this  point. Although our analyses are not complete, the third application for  both materials improved seed production by no more than three seeds per  cone.  Table 2. Project results by treatment.

Pres pray 27 l1ay 9 Jooe 30 June  Sampling Period  Figure 1. Cone damage by treatment  In another test Orthene Acecaps were used to protect Douglas-fir cones  against the western spruce budworm. The Acecap implants were placed  11  in a spiral pattern at four inch intervals around the base of the tree .  Fifteen trees were treated on April 25, 1980 and another 15 were used  as controls. Post spray cone samples were collected at 30, 60 and 90  days for residue analysis. Cone damage and larval densities were also  recorded. Treatment differences appear to be not significant  (Stipe, USFS, ~tlssoula, MT)  ..  In April 1980, 60 cone bearing western white pine were treated  with a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, permethrin, in a field  experiment for control of mountain pine cone beetle in the Sandpoint  Seed Orchard, Sandpoint, Idaho. Treatments ~ere as follows:  Treatment Cone. Number of  Number 1 lbs / 100 ~al H....., O Applications  1 0.25 one  2 0.50 one  3 1.00 one  4 0.25 two  5 0.50 two  6 1.00 two  7 Un-treated Controls  12  All treatments were made with a Bean hydraulic sprayer, time calibrated  to deliver 4 gal. of formulation per tree. The first application occurred  the day after first emergence of the beetle; the second application 10  days later. Treatments were assigned randomly. In June all cones on the  test trees were counted and tallied as infested or uninfested. Data were  analyzed conducting six pairwise tests of difference with a 2 x 2 contingency  table using the Chi- square statistic = .01. Even though all treatments were  statistically significant from the check the attack rates were so low that  drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of permethrin is questionable.  In 1981 we plan to repeat the experiment and we believe that given an adequate  experimental setting there is a high probability of isolating a minimum _  effective dose and effective treatment strategy.  In conjunction with the above experiment several techniques for  monitoring emergence of white pine cone beetle are being developed. They  include; construction of a day/degree model, use of sticky boards, cone  phenology and caged cones.  (Shea, Jenkins and Haverty, PSW For. Expt. Sta . , Davis  at Berkeley, CA)  Treatment of superior Douglas-fir by injection of Metasystox-R  resulted in increased seed yields and permitted the North Zone Tree  Improvement Program to collect badly needed seed from some areas in  Siskiyou County. If data analysis substantiates present judgments, the  method may be adopted for use on selected ""wild"" trees in order to increase  seed collections by seed zones and alleviate the critical shortage of  Douglas-fir seed in northwestern California.

(Weatherby, USFS, FPM, Pineville, LA)  During 1982, Forest Pest Management (USDA Forest Service ,  Alexandria Field Office) will begin the first phase of a pl anned 2-year  special project entitled ""Seed Orchard Pest Population Monitoring and  the Incorporation of Pest Management Practices into a Cone and Seed  Inventory-Nonitoring System . "" The current pest management strategy in  southern pine seed orchards consists of a preventative spray schedule  which is usually based on historical records . The major flaw with this  approach is that it is not responsive to conditions during the current  growing season . This special project is intended to develop a pest  management program which will utilize the latest pest monitoring  techniques to provide damage predictions . These damage predictions  will be incorporated into a computerized cone and seed  inventory-monitoring system. This combined system should help the  orchard manager choose appropriate suppression recommendations that are  responsive to current conditions at his/her orchard .  Cooperating orchards will be selected such that each orchard is  located on a different isotherm. Scouts will follow a reg ular circuit  beginning at the orchard located on the isotherm with the highest  t hermal accumulation and ending at the orchard located on the isotherm  with the lowest thermal accumulation. When pests are detected in an  orchard with the highest thermal accumulation, ""Pest Alerts"" will be  made to orchards with lower thermal accumulations . This procedure  should warn the orchard manager of potential pest problems prior to  experiencing losses . Orchard managers who are not directl y involved as  project cooperators will be able to contact the Al exandria Fiel d Office  for periodic updates on potential pest problems.

My dissertation was entitled "" Toward  Insect Pest Management in Southern Pine Seed Orchards with Emphasis on  the Biology of Tetyra bipunctata (Hem., Pentatomidae) and the Pheromone  of Diotyctria clarioralis (Lep . , Pyralidae) ."" Much of the cone and  seed insect research supported by the Texas Forest Service from 1977  through 1980 was reported in this dissertation which has been publ ished  in its entirety as TFS Publication 126.  2 . Biology  (Cameron , TFS , Lufkin, TX)  The seasonal flight periods of coneworm moths, (Dioryctria s pp . )  have been monitored with light traps from 1976 through 1981 . Numbers  of moths caught in light traps have varied greatly between years and  collection sites, but the seasonal flight patterns were similar between  sites wi t hin years .  Methods of rearing blister coneworm (D . clarioralis) larvae on the  elm spam.;orm artificial diet we r e established as part of a study to  ide ntify the blister coneworm pheromone . Through laboratory and field  studies the primary components of the pheromone have been iden tified .  Hany loblolly pine cone\wrm (~- Â· merkeli) males also were caught in  field traps baited with the same synthe tic pheromone blends most  attractive to blister coneworm males . Field tests are planned for 1982  to further refine the blister coneworm pheromone mixture .  3 . Damage  (Averill , USFS , FPM, Anchorage, AK)  Seed damage from all causes was down this year based on seed  submitted to the State Forestry nursery at Palmer . No quantitative  data was collected however .  (Dale , USFS, FPM, San Francisco , CA)  Cone c rops generally were poor throughout California for all tree  species . In those local situations where cones were sufficiently  abundant for collection, damage from insects frequently was mode rate t o  heavy and often sufficiently severe to preclude coll ec tion . In  particular, r ed fir cone crops in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains  were severely damaged . The tree breeding program at Badger Hill ,  Eldorado National Forest , was hindered by heavy cone and seed losses in  both Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine.  3  (Schenk , University of Idaho, Moscow, ID)  The following is a sununary of John 0 . Johnsen ' s as yet unpublished  M. S . thesi s (June 1981) on the influence of a prescribed burn on  ponderosa pine (PP) cone and seed production and losses to insects .  A prescribed understory burn of moderate intensity was  appli ed t o a 64 ha PP stand with the objective of red ucing  f ue l and seed bed preparation . The squared sum of conelets  a nd cones on 8 branchlets throughout t he crowns of 41  wi nd- t hr own PP were regressed against t he t otal cone l e t s and  cones/tr ee . This model provided an accurate means of  estimating conele t and cone production/standing tree (r 2 =  0 . 92 a nd 0 . 93 , r espectively) . Conelet production decl ined  from an average of 1 . 68/branchlet in 1979 to 0 . 40 i n 1980 .  Nevert hel ess , 1980 conelet production on trees in burned  plots s i gnificantly (p &lt; . 05) exceeded production in unburned  plots .  The light cone crop that matured in 1979 suffered about  97% loss to Conophthorus ponderosae Hopk. The 1980 cone crop  r eflected the previous year ' s prolific conelet production.  The number of mature, uninfested 1980 cones did not differ  signifi cant ly (p&lt;. 05) between burned and unburned plo t s . The  numbers of cones infested by the cone beetle also did no t  diff e r s i gnificantly (p &lt; . 05) between burned and unburned  pl o t s , a l though cone losses amounted to 7.5% and 13 . 4% ,  respectively .  The length of infested cones differed significantly (p&lt;  .05) between treatments. Thus , larger cones were available  in burned plots at the time of beetle attack; however , there  was no significant (p &lt; . 61) difference in the numbers of  teneral adults between treatments .  No significant relationships were found between direct  effec t s of fire (e . g., crown or bole scorch) and conelet and  cone producti on or insect- caused damage . Previ ous studies  have shown an i nitial increase of available N following  b urni ng . The d i fferences in cone produc t ion observed in this  study may have been a reflection of that phenomenon .  (Andrews and Ragenovich , USFS , FPN, Albuquerque , NM)  U. S . For est Ser vice entomologists in New Mexico sampled cone lots  coming i nto t he Albuquerque Tree Nursery to determine what insect  damage was occurring and what percent of the seed was lost as a result  of insects . Lots included cones from ponderosa pine, Douglas- fir ,  spruce, white fir , and pinyon pine . A sample was taken from each cone  lot coming int o the nursery. Sample cones were dried and the seed  ext racted and X- rayed . A total of 22 lots was sampled . In 16 of the  lots, 15% or less of the total seed was damaged by insects. A  4  Douglas-fir lot  Cydia sp . was  second.  had the most damage , with 55% attributed to insects .  responsible for most insect damage , and Megastigmus sp .  I n addition, a study done in cooperation with John Schmid of the  Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station and Mike Wagner of  Northern Arizona University , to determine the impact of insects on  second- year ponderosa pines in Arizona , was concluded . In one  location, 80% of the total seed was damaged or destroyed by insects .  In the remaining three locations , insects accounted for damage t o l ess  than 17% of t otal seed . Conophthorus ponderosae Hopkins and  Megastigmus albifrons Walker were the pri mary insects causing damage .  Othe r insects associa t ed with the cones and seeds wer e : Cydia sp. ,  Dior yctria s p . , and Smicronyx imbrica tus Casey . Some infor ma tion was  also collected on insect biology.  4 .

(Cameron, TFS , Lufkin, TX)  A study was conducted in Texas during 1981 to evaluate insect  damage associ ated with several insecticide application schedul es .  Treatments included : 1) five hydraulic sprays of Guthion timed to  coincide with seasonal oviposition periods of coneworms a nd seed bugs  2) four Guthion sprays coinciding with oviposition periods , 3 ) four  Guthion sprays applied be tween oviposition perids , 4) Furadan applied  in early February, 5) Furadan applied in late April and 6) a check (no  treatment) . Conelet and cone s urvi val , percent coneworm damage among  harvested cones , seed yields and seed quality from treated and check  trees were monitored to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments . For  most variables monitored , there were significant differences (p&lt; .05)  between the Guthion and the Furadan treatments, but not between the  Furadan treat ments and the check.

Mistblower applications with  FMC Speedsprayers (Model F757 CP) were made in S.C. and La . seed  orchards. One hundred gallons/ac were applied to 1. 6-2.0 acre blocks  of loblolly pine . Â· In the Ga . test , individual loblolly pine trees were  sprayed to run-off with a hydraulic sprayer. Five to six applications  were made at 4- week intervals beginning in April .  Ambush gave good control of Dioryctria spp. in the Ga. and S.C.  tests. In the Ga . test, the middle and upper rates had significantly  less damage than the lower rate and these rates of Ambush performed as  well as the registered rate of Guthion . There was no difference in  percent Dioryctria damage bet\\leen rates of Ambush in S.C . Dioryc t ria  disclusa damage in the Ga . test ranged from 0-2% of the crop in the  Ambush treatments and it was 6.2% in the control. The differences  between the Ambush treatments and control were significant. In La . ,  Guthion was the best treatment but the Ambush treatments were similiar  to the cont rol in Dioryctria damage. Analyses of seed bug damage have  not been completed. ICI will apply for registration of Ambush at the  same ra tes as those of Pydrin; however, there may not be a restriction  on amount/ac .

Viable seed yield increase was 1.7% and  5 . 8% in 1980 and 11.8% in 1981 . Spraying reduced Douglas-fir cone mo th  and fir coneworm impact , but Douglas- fir seed chalcid damage was  unaffected . For some unexplained reason, Douglas-fir cone gall midge  impact was much higher in the Guthion-treated cones.  A Special Local Need 24(C) Registration was obtained from the  State of Oregon to use Orethene . This material is being tested in our  Douglas-fir and western white pine seed orchards located in Oregon to  manage cone and seed insect damage .  (Wea therby , USFS, FPM, Pineville, LA)  An aerial application pilot project for controlling cone and seed  insects was conducted during 1980 and 1981 in a loblolly pine seed  orchard (DeRidder , LA .) In 1980, Guthion (2 lb. AI/acre) and Pydrin  (0 . 67 lb . AI/acre) were each applied by helicopter in five monthly  applica tions (May- Sep t ember) t o individual five acre blocks . In 1981,  the same blocks were trea ted by fixed ~~ing.

General  (Cameron, TFS, Lufkin, TX)  The size of this year's Cone and Seed Insect Newsletter is not  representative of the activity concerning cone and seed insects which  occurred during 1982. However, it may well represent a trend, in part  due to budget cuts. Since this is a compilation of voluntary  contributions, I have not included information or recent publications  which were not submitted to me as a result of the call for contributions.  Based on this year's response, there appears to be little use in  continuing to compile and distribute the Cone and Seed Insect Newsletter.  Most of you are members of the International Union of Forestry  Research Organizations (IUFRO) Cone and Seed Insects Working Party and  receive the newsletter compiled and distributed by Dr. Harry 0. Yates  III, chairman of the working party. The IUFRO Newsletter has been  distributed every 6 months (January and June) from 1978 through the  present; it has an extensive world-wide distribution and its content is  similar to that of the Cone and Seed Insect Newsletter, however, it may  lack some of the informality and free exchange of information  characteristic of the original newsletter.  It might be best to discontinue this newsletter and in the future  send items of interest to Harry Yates for inclusion in the IUFRO Cone and  Seed Insects Working Party Newsletter. Harry is in favor of this  proposition. However, if it is the consensus of the group to continue  the Cone and Seed Insect Newsletter in its present form, I will be happy  to serve as compiler for another year to complete my 3 year term.  Please express your opinion on this matter by checking the  appropriate box and/or writing your comments on the attached sheet and  returning it to me. The results of this survey will be sent to the  people on the Cone and Seed Insect Newsletter mailing list in April, and  if necessary the matter could be discussed at the IUFRO Cone and Seed  Insects Working Party Conference to be held in Athens, GA, from July 31  through August 6 , 1983.  ll Contributions submitted by persons working with cone and seed insects  and assembled by R.

Russ Clausen hopefully will finish his PhD research on the  bioenergetic relationships of the insects infesting Douglas- fir cones and  seeds. We will be able to give details in the next newsletter .  A new project on the influence of time of nitrogen fertilization on  cone (seed) production and losses to insects in a DF seed production area  will be initiated in 1983, assuming the planned funding and graduate  students are still available .  (Meso, USFS, FPM, Port l and, OR)  A program is being developed in the Northwest to determine if  pesticide use in seed orchards will cause tree seed chromosome damage.  The Regional Geneticist, Region 6, is working with the Pacific Northwest  Forest and Range Experiment Station's Genetic Improvement Group and the  Oregon State Seed Testing Laboratory to develop a standard procedure for  detecting genetic damage. This program will measure germination rate and  seedling abnormality of selected seed lots . Root tip chromosome analysis  will be made of suspected seed lots to conf irm damage.

General  CONE AND SEED INSECT NEWSLETTERJ!  March 1971  The ""Newsletter"" is over 10 years old. It was s tarted in July 1960  with three contributors and a distribution li ~t of 10 recipients. The first  release was entitled ""Progress in Cone and Seed Insect Research - July 1960""  (Johnson - North Carolina).  Two Douglas-fir cone and seed insect research projects have been  initiated at Oregon State University under Dr. W. P. Nagel's direction. One  project is part of the International Biological Program, Western Coniferous  Biome Study, and will support one graduate student, Evan Nebeker. Project  objectives are (1) to identify those insect species which exert a dominant  influence as cone and seed consumers, (2) to assess the role of these insects  in the overall energy budget, (3) to follow population changes of these species,  and (4) to determine the causes of the population changes . The second project,  more applied in emphasis, is supported by the School of Forestry and will employ  one graduate student, Malcolm Russell. Project goals are (1) to study the causes  of cone and seed insect population increases, especially Barbara sp. and MegaÂ­stigmus  sp. in Douglas-fir stands and seed orchards and (2) to incorporate the  knowledge about these courses into programs to help manage these insects in  both preventative and curative techniques (Nagel - Oregon).  Mrs. Barcia, Secretary, Seed Orchard Insects Research Work Unit, has  completed compilation of a Bibliograph of Insects Affecting the Seed ProducÂ­tion  of North American Conifers which covers the literature through 1970. She  is presently working on manuscript organization and if all goes well, this  might be published in 1971 (Merkel - Florida).  The 1970 spruce cone crop was very good in most regions (Redlin -  British Columbia, Canada) .  The 1971 west side Douglas-fir cone crop in Oregon looks very good  (Meso - Oregon).  In Washington we are heading for a year with a lot of flowering DouglasÂ­fir  trees (Stoszek -Washington).  Dr. R. N. Coulson has moved from Georgia to Lufkin, Texas (Franklin -  Georgia). He has joined the Texas Forest Service as Principal Entomologist  in the Pest Control Section (Coulson - Texas).  A new technician, James M. Reeves, has been added to the Entomology  Program at New Mexico State University . He will work half time on cone and  seed insects (Kinzer - New Mexico).  1/contributions submitted by cone and seed insect research workers,  resource managers, and tree improvement specialists. These unpublished data  cannot be used without contributor's approval. Items assembled by S. W. Meso,  U.S. Forest Service, Portland, Oregon .  Howard Dew, 1970 Forestry graduate of Oregon State University, has  been added to the Timber Service Company staff. His prime responsibilities  will involve tree improvement, reforestation, and timber stand improvement  (Barringer - Oregon).  New equipment has been added at the University of Georgia . EntomoloÂ­gists  now have a new Pitman MN-50 Hot stik SO-foot, 2-man bucket aerial device.  This unit gives outstanding mobility and ease of sampling (Franklin - Georgia).  2. Insect Identification and Biology  We collected 11,700 Douglas-fir cones from 13 a r eas in Montana and  Yellowstone National Park this past summer. Three-fourths of these were  dissected and the other fourth placed in rearing containers. This was the  third and final year of an evaluation designed to inventory Douglas-fir cone  and seed insects and measure the level of injury. A total of 52,500 cones  were collected in the three years. Insects from the 1970 collections are  still at the National Museum being identified . To date, we have had 39  species of insects identified from these cones. Fourteen of these are cone  feeders, 22 are parasites and predators, and the role of three species is  unknown. We have reared three new species plus some new state and host  records. The species are a thrip Oxythrips sp ., a tachinid Actia sp., and  a gelechiid Chionodes sp. The western spruce budworm Choristoneura occiÂ­dentalis  Free. was the most important insect each of the 3 year s, followed  by cone midges Contarinia washingtonensis Johnson and f. oregonensis Foote,  cone worms Dioryctria abietivorella (Grote) and]. pseudotsugella Munroe,  and the cone moth Barbara colfaxiana (Kft.) (Ciesla - Montana).  Alan Redlin is working on cone insects in spruce with main emphasis  on Picea glauca. Observations are also being conducted on Picea engelmannii,  f. sitchensis, and f. mariana. Biological studies are being conducted on  Hylemya anthracina, the main seed destroyer in spruce (Redlin - British  Columbia , Canada).  The Pest Control Section is currently involved in cone and seed  insects in seed orchards and production areas . The Dioryctria spp . of east  Texas have recently been surveyed and Dioryctria amatella, ] . zimmermani,  and ]. c l arioralis are the three most important representatives (Coulson -  Texas).  Two new species of midges (Diptera:Cecidomyiidae} we r e reared from  ponderosa pine cones collected in Idaho. One is a Cecidomyi a sp. which  Dr. R. J. Gagnel/ is describing and which will appear in a supertribal  revision. The other is a Profeltiella sp. that belongs in a group of midges  also being revised by Dr. Gagne (Parker - Utah}.  l lsystematic Entomology Laboratory, Entomology Research Division, AgriÂ­cultural  Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.  -2-  Cone and seed insect problems are hardly recognized in the Rocky  Mountain area of Colorado. Consequently, there has been little work done  in the past. At Colorado State University, Judy Bodenham, a graduate  student in entomology, is rearing ponderosa pine cone insects in order  to determine what complex is involved. She is making an intensive study  of a weevil, presumably Conotrachelus sp . , which is common in Front Range  ponderosa pine stands. Dr . T. 0. Thatcher at the Univer sity has also made  a weevil observation in the past. The outcome should be a review of the  insect complex in ponderosa pine for this region and the identification,  description, and bionomics of the weevil prepared mostly by Judy Bodenham  and aided by Dr. Thatcher (Stevens, Colorado).  A study of the responses of ""walking"" Conophthorus ponderosae to  volatile attractants is in progress. The walking beetles readily respond  to attractive volatile substance in an olfactometer similar to the one  designed by Klieforth, 1964, probably indicating that a mandatory flight  is not required before host selection is possible as in some Scolytids.  Females showed a significant increase in response to 1% ponderosa  pine resin and 1%~-pinene. Males showed no significant increase in  response to either 1% resin or other ol eoresin fractions. Mycrene caused  a slight (not statistically significant) negative response in both males  and females.  Males were significantly a ttracted to trap vials containing coneÂ­fed  females plus a source of oleoresin, but to a lesser degree to fed  females only, perhaps indicating that a pheromone is involved. This  possibility needs confirmation (Kinzer - New Mexico).  Studies are in progress to locate the sex pheromone gland of  female Dioryctria abietella moths. An enl arged glandular area suspected  to be the sex pheromone gland was located in the intersegmental fold  between the eighth and ninth abdominal segments. This enlarged region  is in the shape of a ""ring gland"" and large, columnar epithelial cells  are visible in sagittal sections of the gland.  An active feeding stimulant for larvae of ~. abietella was extracted  from first-year slash pine conelets of a tree previously noted to be highly  susceptible to attacks by Dioryctria spp. This same fraction of the extract  also appears to contain an oviposit ional stimulant for female moths (Fatzinger -  Florida).  3. Damage  A paper entitled ""Impact of Dioryctria amatella on Seed Yields of  Maturing Slash and Loblolly Pine Cones in Mississippi Seed Orchards."" A  screening program was conducted in 1969-1970 in an attempt to locate possible  clones resistant to this pest in three Mississippi seed orchards (Strator and  Neel -Mississippi) .  About all that the Genetics Institute here in Gulfport can report in  the way of forest tree seed-destroying insects is that a very low yield of  control-pollinated seed was collected in fall 1970, mainly due to cessation  -3-  of our spraying program in the aftermath of the moratorium on the use of hard  pesticides. In previous years, we normally realized about 75% collectable  cones from those pollinated- this year it was about 28%. Dioryctria sp.,  mainly amatella and abietella, were the chief species responsible. In all  fairness to the bugs, however, it must be noted that hurricane Camille was  pretty rough on the first year conelets last year (Coyne -Mississippi).  Eight hundred ponderosa pine cones were collected from six locations in  Montana for dissecting and rearing during 1970. Over a third of these cones  were deformed by insects. Some of the insects reared are still at the National  Museum being identified. The most common insects found were Laspeyresia sp.,  Dioryctria auranticella (Grote), and midges probably Contarinia sp. One area  had 97% of the cones examined infested with Laspeyresia. Most of the seeds  were destroyed in these cones. Our future plans are to expand sample size  and increase sampling points in 1971 to more accurately survey the insects  present and evaluate injury (Ciesla-Montana).  Pinyon pine, Pinus edulis, cones were collected from five areas near  Panguitch, Utah to determine seed loss caused by insects and to compare cone  length with seed number. A total of 1,000 cones were collected and analyzed.  Cone and seed damage was caused by one insect a pine seed moth, possibly  Hedulia injectiva Heinrich.l/ This larva caused damage by boring thro~~h cone  scales and seeds. An ichneumonid parasite, Erachus turgidus Holmger,fl was  reared from the damaged cones. A high correlation was found (r=0.934) between  cone length and seed number.  The results of the pine seed moth damage are summarized below.

This would indicate that the pine seed  moth larvae have the ability to distinguish between sound and hollow seed  (Stipe - Utah).  In 1970, a relatively heavy cone yield year, over 56% (range 7-97%  among plots) of the cones examined were deformed by insects. Budworm  infested 34% (range 2-79%) of the cones; midges infested 21% (range 0-78%)  of the cones; cone moths were found in 21% (range 0-79%) of the cones; and  coneworms infested 14% (range 0-41%) of the cones. All other species found  occurred in less significant numbers (Ciesla- Montana).  At least 90% of a small 1970 Douglas-fir cone crop at the Timber  Service Company's David T. Mason Seed Orchard was heavily infested with  Dioryctria spp. and/or Contarinia spp. (Barringer Oregon).  A joint study is being carried out between Tom Koerber, Pacific  Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, and Insect and Disease  Control Branch in Portland to determine Leptoglossus occidentalis impact  on control pollinated western white pine cones. Study site is the Dorena  Seed Orchard, where white pine seedlings are being screened to determine  what crosses show resistence to white pine blister rust. Heavy blackbird  populations last spring decimated adult Leptoglossus populations at the seed  orchard (Meso - Oregon).  4. Control  Two 6-acre white spruce plantations in Voluntown, Connecticut consisÂ­tently  produce cone crops which are destroyed by a cone maggot Pegohylemia  anthracina. Nurseryman C. G. Merril tried a 0.25% dimethoate hydraulic spray  for control after pollination was completed. The results are as follows:  Cones infested  Cones uninfested  Total  Chi Square:  Treated  21  39  60  Computed  Tabular  Untreated  5.67  3.84  5.02  6.63  34  26  60  5.0% level  2.5% level  1.0% level  Total  55  65  120  Future spray treatments will be applied earlier and treatment effecÂ­tiveness  will be determined in terms of viable seed amount (Ford - New  Hampshire).  Spray applications of insecticides with low mammalian toxicity and  bark applications of systemic insecticides have been tested as replacements  for broadcast applications of Thimet for control of Dioryctria spp. in  loblolly pine seed orchards.  -5-  In late August 1970, systemic insecticides (Bidrin, Thimet and Meta  Systox-R) mixed with liquid plastics (Estab and Poly Em 40) were applied to  the bark of 2- to 3-inch d.b.h. noncone-bearing trees in a loblolly pine  seed orchard. These tests were designed to determine phytotoxicity to  foliage and bark before applicatiOn to cone-bearing trees. No phytotoxicity  has yet been indicated. A bioassay using Lambdina athasaria pellucidaria  on branches cut from the treated trees indicated that Bidrin (40 ml techÂ­nical  material only, or 40 ml technical in combination with 100 ml of either  Poly Em 40 or Estab) was translocated to the needles in sufficient quantities  to kill 32% to 90% of the test insects. None of the other treatment caused  appreciable insect mortality. Tests will continue in 1971 to evaluate phytoÂ­toxicity  of spring treatments and some applications will be made on coneÂ­bearing  trees.  In another series of tests, hydraulic sprays of 0.125% Gardona and  0.125% Gardona and 0.125% Sevin were applied by hydraulic sprayer on June 15  and July 1, 1970, to each of three trees in a loblolly pine seed production  area. In the fall the trees were felled and examined for Dioryctria damaged  cones. The results are presented below. Very small damaged cones were not  included in the counts since they were attacked before the first spray was  applied.  Total cones (3 trees)  Percent Dioryctria damaged  0.125% Gardona  405  21.0%  0.125% Sevin  168  30.3%  699  47.5%  Both treatments were significantly different than the checks at the  .05 level.  Hydraulic sprays in 1971 will involve slightly stronger solutions and  will be applied earlier in the growing season in hopes of improving the  effectiveness of these low-toxicity insecticides (Copony- Virginia).  Three systemic organophosphates have been used in a test designed to  study the control of Dioryctria amatella in a Mississippi slash pine seed  orchard. It appears that Azodrin is more effective than Bidrin and the  latter more effective than Meta Systox-R in control of this pest when the  toxic materials are pipetted into holes bored in the tree trunks (Ray and  Neel - Mississippi).  A study was made in 1970 to compare on an operational basis several  insecticides for their efficiency in controlling several insect species  attacking slash and loblolly pine cones. The results are as follows.  -6-  Chemical Rate of Frequence of Damaged Sound  A;2;21ication AEElication Cones Cones Basis  .k z II cones  Thimet 80/llOG/acre Once, 2/15/70 nl/ 89 4,079  Thimet 80/llOG/acre Once, 2/15/70  - - plus - -  BHC 0.5% spray Once, 8/5/70 71/ 93 14,078  BHC 0 .5% spray Every other week 2ll 98 4,136  Alternating with  Guthion 0.125% spray 5/13 - 9/5/70  Azodrin 0.3% spray Once, 5/20/70 6?:..1 94 2,863  (One side of tree)  Azodrin 0.3% spray Once, 5/20/70 4'1J 96 2,149  (Two sides of tree)  Average 6 94 5,461  No spray 29V 71 2,759  l/Loblo11y pine  1/slash pine  Azodrin applied once as a 0.3% spray gave nearly as good control of  insects in slash pine cones as did BHC and Guthion when they were sprayed on  loblolly pine every other week. The advantages of a single or possibly two  sprays over spraying each week are obvious . If these results are repeatable,  insect control in the North Carolina orchard should be reduced to about oneÂ­fifth  of current costs. Although Azodrin is more toxic than BHC, (350 mg/kg  vs. 900 mg/kg dermel) it is less toxic than Thimet and, once mixed, would not  be particularly dangerous. In fact, it is less toxic than Guthion. There is  a possibility that because of its toxicity to birds, Azodrin will not retain  its label. Last year it was sold in North Carolina for aphid control on  several agricultural plants (Johnson- North Carolina).  Exploratory work with Daphnia water fleas and laboratory-reared  Dioryctria abietella larvae showed promise for the use of these animals in  bioassay tests to determine the speed of uptake into slash pine cones and  duration of toxicity of trunk-implanted Bidrin. We expect to expand this  research in 1971 (Merkel and Fatzinger - Florida).  A 2.5% water suspension of carbaryl plus Miller's Mu-Film 17 extender  was applied by mist blower to longleaf pine. Sprays were applied seven times:  10/14/69, 4/9/70, 5/7/70, 6/4/70, 7/2/70, 7/30/70 and 8/21/70. Analysis of  data has not been completed but reduction of attacks by Dioryctria spp. on  first and second-year cones was very low. Seedworm infestation data has not  yet been taken (Merkel - Florida).  -7-  Bidrin and closely related Azodrin were implanted into drill holes in  the trunks of slash pine seed production trees on May 11, 1970. Trees averÂ­aged  40 years of age, 75 feet in height, and 16 inches d.b.h. Both systemics  were applied at the rate of 3 grams active toxicant per inch of stem diameter  at waist height. Untreated check trees sustained an average of 27% Dioryctria  attacks on second-year cones at cone harvest ; whereas cone infestation per tree  in the Bidrin treatment averaged 12% and averaged only 6% in the Azodrin treatÂ­ment.  Bidrin implants performed considerably below earlier tests. This may  have been caused by excessively heavy rainfall for two months following implant  (Merkel - Florida) .  Dicrotophos, (Bidrin) technical liquid, was implanted into the trunks of  40-year-old slash pine seed production trees at Olustee, Florida in 1969. The  systemic was applied in early February, March, April and May into holes drilled  in the trunks at the dosage rate of 5 g/in diam. of actual dicrotophos. Twenty  trees were treated on each of the implant dates and 20 additional trees served  as untreated checks; i.e., they received drill holes in early May but no chemical  was implanted.

Cones from unt r eated trees avera ged 19% infested .  The early April and May implants were the only treatmc nt 1c- which reduced  ~ eedworm infes tation s i gni ficantly (P =O .OS) below that of the check trees.  An unexpected encour aging r esul t of the study was the better than 90%  control of Dioryctria spp . coneworms on mature cones at harvest time in all  of the treatments. All implants (dates of app lication) re sulted in s ignifiÂ­cantly  (P=0.05) fewer coneworm attacks when compar ed with checks in September .  Coneworm infe s tation averaged 12% on check trees and less t han 1% in all  treatments (table 2) (Merkel- Florida).  The Pest Control Section of the Texas Forest Ser vice plans to initiate  an insect management program in their seed orcha r ds in 1971 utilizing sys t emic  insecticide basal tree injections (Coulson - Texas).  Future plans for Dougl as-fir cone and seed insect control in Montana  are t o field test some chemical control methods with 3n emphas i s on sys t emics.  Whether this will occur in 1971 or the coming year s depends on job priorities  (Cies l a -Montana).  A t es t was made in 1971 to determine whether Meta Systox-R exhibits  cytogenetic effects on Dougla s - f ir seed. A 1% spr ay was applied on a sunny  day to conelets a fter they we r e pollinated and turned down . Cones were  sprayed to the point of runoff . Both treated and untreated cones we r e on  diffe rent branches of the same mature tree. Branchlets containing cones  were covered with bags befor e and afte r treatment. Conelets under study  were later bagged with mesh screen to preven t insect attacks. The r ecorded  results are as follows.

A 0 .7 5% Meta Systox-R  s pray was applied. St. He l en stock 1969 conele t s were bagged with pollinaÂ­tion  bags before treatment and were not sprayed . Since no problems were  anticipated all r ema ining conelets were sprayed.  -9-  The following results were recorded.

Thus, it appears that under certain, as yet unaccounted  for, factor interaction, application of Meta Systox-R at 0.75-% concentration  is unsafe. We suspect that the weather condition at time of application has  affected the results. We are contemplating a study to test this and other  possibilities.  If anybody experiences a similar ""happening"" please let me know; I will  appreciate suggestions as to other possible causes (Stoszek -Washington).  Fifty acres of grafted cone-bearing Douglas-fir will be treated this  spring at the Timber Service Company's Mason Seed Orchard near Sweethome,  Oregon. Dimethoate will be used. Project control effectiveness will be  evaluated this summer and reported in the next newsletter (Barringer - Oregon) .  A pilot study has been developed to use tree-injected dimethoate on an  operational basis here in the Northwest. Since all Douglas-fir seed in Oregon  and Washington is now certified, particular attention is given to seed sources  from specific zones and elevation band s . The Siskiyou National Forest in  southern Oregon has found their reforestation program for specific sites in  jeopardy because of low or nonexistant seed inventories. Dimethoate is  registered for Douglas-fir cone and seed insect control only when applied  with hydraulic equipment. Because of tree size and limited accessibility,  hydraulic equipment cannot be effectively used on this Forest. The pilot  program has been stalled until American Cyanamid Company secures registration  for tree injecting dimethoate. Registration procedures are progressing  smoothly and we hope to continue the project this spring (Meso- Oregon).  -10-  5. Publications  Coulson, R. N. & R. T. Franklin.

I considered  trying to spot it in the Journal, but the seven full-length articles  on convention subjects ate up all the space I could budget. I'm  therefore returning the text and the illustrations.  Your long-hand note of transmittal indicated that I had asked  for the piece, but there must have been a failure of communication  somewhere, as I didn't know it was coming. Nevertheless I'm sorry  it couldn't be used and thank you and Benson for the effort.  I believe that Maury Vogel has told you that Roger Chapman,  Dennis Le Master, and Donald Weatherhead have prepared a manuscript  that we will print in lieu of Louise Sha1duck's piece on Idaho  forests. Mrs. Shadduck phoned the other day and didn't seem unduly  disturbed when I told her I planned to make the switch. The new  manuscript describes the whole region rather than just Idaho, and  it treats more aspects of forestry.  Editor, Journal of Forestry  NHS:mro  encs. - ms. (original)  slides (2), negatives  TREES FOR THE FUTURE  By Norman L. Hesseldahl and Darrell Benson  Providing vigorous young tree seedlings for public forestlands in  the inland northwest is a challenging mission, but one that the Coeur d'Alene  Tree Nursery is ideally suited to meet.  Located just a mile northwest of Coeur d' Alene, Idaho, the Nursery  is situated on 220 acres of agricultural land selected for its relatively  uniform and rock-free soils, good drainage and flat topography. Underground  lies the Rathdrum aquifer, a giant subterranean river extending from Lake  Pend Oreille to Spokane , which provides ample water for field irrigation .  With 135 acres permanently irrigated, the Nursery fields have the capacity  to produce 20 million bare-root 2-0 (two year-old) seedlings annually . BareÂ­root  stock is used to reforest lands which have been recently harvested, as  well as to gradually reforest the 300,000 acres which have been burned over  several times by major wildfires in the past 70 years .  In addition, the Nursery boasts the largest container-grown seedling  program of the 13 Forest Service nurseries , with the capacity to grow up to  3.5 million containerized seedlings in two crops annually , using 15 climateÂ­controlled  greenhouses. Container stock can be ready for out-planting in a  scant six months, making it effective for emergency reforestation efforts  following floods, forest fires or other natural disasters. Container seedlings  may also be used for fall planting, when dormant bare-root stock is not  available.  The Nursery also serves as the seed bank for the National Forests  in Region 1. Seeds are extracted from cones, de-winged, cleaned, tested and  '  stored in freezers, where they may be held for 10 years or more before  planting in Nursery seedbeds. In addition, the Nursery grows western white  pine blister rust-resistant seedlings from parent stock located at seed  orchards in Sandpoint and the University of Idaho arboretum in Moscow.  -2-  Enjoying international acclaim for its unique application of skilled  hand labor combined with innovative, one-of-a-kind machinery, the Coeur d'Alene  Tree Nursery hosts thousands of visitors each year. Located less than an  hour's drive from 1980 SAF Convention headquarters in Spokane, Washington,  conventioneers are invited to include a tour of the Nursery in their leisure  time activities . For detailed information about individual and group tours,  please contact the Nursery Superintendent, Darrell Benson, at (208) 667-2561,  extension 375.  ..  PHOTO CAPTIONS  Photo 1 - Following germination, container-grown stock is painstakingly  hand-thinned, leaving the most vigorous seedling to flourish in  each container. These new seedlings will be ready for planting  in only a few months.  Photo 2 - These thriving two year-old seedlings are almost ready for their  journey from nursery seedbeds to their planting site, where they  will be ready for harvest in 80-100 years .  Photo 3 - Developed especially for the Coeur d'Alene Tree Nursery, this  giant ""lifter"" removes seedlings from their seedbed and gently  separates tender roots from the surrounding soil.  Photo 4- After lifting, young trees are placed in protective packaging for  their journey to the planting site.  Photo 5 - (Nursery aerial slide) Viewed from the air, the Nursery looks like  the well-managed farm it is .  Photo 6- (Nursery sign slide) No caption needed.  Photo 7 - Despite its use of specialized machinery, the nursery still relies  on skilled hand labor for many phases of its operation. About  350 area residents are employed on a part-time basis to accomplish  such delicate tasks as weeding, thinning and handlifting stock.",,,,2015-08-25,2015-08-25,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/150,150,200.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/200.pdf,forestryresearch150

General  Dr. Clyde Sartor completed his Ph.D. program last May. His  dissertation is entitled ""Studies of Pine Cone Insects in MissisÂ­sippi  with Special Emphasis on the Impact of Dioryctria amatella  (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae) on Seed Yields."" He is presÂ­ently  Extension Entomologist, Mississippi State University.  Mr. Henry Ray completed his master's program last August.  His thesis is entitled ""Trunk Implants of Systemic Insecticides in  Seed Orchard Slash Pine Trees for Control of the Coneworm, DiorÂ­yctria  sp. Lepidoptera: Phycitidae)."" Mr. Ray is presently emÂ­ployed  as a research entomologist with Geigy Chemical Company.  (Neel - Mississippi)  In June 1971, Gerard (""Gerry"") D. Hertel, Research EntomoloÂ­gist,  was transferred from the Forestry Sciences Laboratory, ReÂ­search  Triangle Park, N. c., to the Seed Orchard Insects Research  Work Unit, Olustee, Fla. The major portion of Gerry's research  will be devoted to studies of the impact of forest insects on  first-year pine reproduction in the slash pine ecosytem and secondÂ­ar.  ily, he will work on seed orchard insect problems. Chemical  control studies were de-emphasized during 1971 and greater emphaÂ­sis  is being given to biology and behavioral studies in search of  alternative methods for control of destructive seed orchard inÂ­sects.  (Merkel - Florida)  Jack Coster has moved from Texas A&M University to Stephen F.  Austin State University. (Coster - Texas)  Dr. Stephen Cade has been assigned the responsibility for cone  and seed insect research and operational control at Weyerhaeuser's  Forestry Research Center at Centralia, Washington. His research  will be confined to insect control. (Cade - Washington)  A long-term study of seed and cone insects was initiated in  the Intermountain Region, u. s. Forest Service, in 1971. Most of  the study sites will be located on the Boise and Payette National  Forests in southwestern Idaho. Major study emphasis will be on  insect identification, life histories, and damage appraisals. Mr.  John w. Dale conducted the study in 1971. (Parker - Utah)  1/ Contributions submitted by cone and seed insect research  workers, resource managers, and tree improvement specialists.  These unpublished data cannot be used without contributor's apÂ­proval.  Items assembled by s. W. Meso, U. s. Forest Service,  Portland, Oregon.  An In-Service report entitled ""A Three-Year Evaluation of  Douglas-fir Cone and Seed Insects in Montana and Yellowstone  National Park, Wyoming,"" is in the final stages.  2  Plans for 1972 include a rather extensive survey of the inÂ­sects  of ponderosa pine and Engelmann spruce cones.  Work done with seed and cone insects in Region l was conÂ­ducted  under the leadership of Jerald E. Dewey, entomologist.  (Ciesla - Montana)  At Athens, Georgia a 25-foot flowering shortleaf pine has  been enclosed in an insect-proof cage. This has provided a  caged whole-tree sample for studying development, overwintering  habits, and biology of known seed and cone insect populations.  The cage has survived two severe ice storms during the past two  winters . Details on construction can be obtained from B. H. Ebel  at Athens. (Yates - Georgia)  Cone and seed insect research in New Mexico was hampered in  1971 by a very poor cone crop in Douglas-fir in the Lincoln, Cibola  and Gila National Forests. Also by unusually low temperatures in  the Gila and Cibola National Forests that severely limited the  overwintering population of Conophthorus ponderosae which is the  insect on which most research was planned. (Kinzer - New Mexico)  The 1971 cone crop in Utah, Nevada, southern Idaho, and westÂ­ern  Wyoming was unusual because so many tree species had abundant  crops. Cones were particularly abundant on Pinus ponderosa, Abies  grandis, A. Zasiooarpa, and Pioea engeZmannii.  The outlook for the 1972 cone crop is not favorable for most  tree specie~ (Parker - Utah)  The 1971 Douglas-fir cone crops were medium to heavy west of  the Oregon and Washington Cascades. Insect populations were genÂ­erally  dispersed and seed damage relatively light. Greater insect  impact is expected in 1972 when cone crops will be light and scatÂ­tered.  Viable seed production will be limited by lack of pollen  rather than insect impact. (Meso - Oregon)  Although I am no longer fully engaged in cone insect research,  I am still intrigued by the great possibilities it affords for  studying fundamental ecological relationships and principles. Cones  and cone insects represent an easily defined subsystem that is simiÂ­lar  to but much less complex than the larger forest ecosystem. Cone  insects have basically the same problems as any forest phytophage  except for the fact that their food supply is more limited and variÂ­able  (considering both time and space). As a result, we should  expect keen competition among the insects for food, development of  special cone finding or detecting mechanisms, and probably simpliÂ­fied  population dynamics that are closely tuned to availability of  food. The influence of cone insects on the physiological processes  3  of the trees should not be overlooked, nor should other factors  (climatic variables, forest defoliators, etc.) that affect the  trees' physiological status and thereby affect the food supplies  (quantity and quality) of cone insects. Undoubtedly, the most  fruitful cone insect research program would be one that is part of  a larger systems study of bud primordia initiation, differentiation,  and maturation. (Mattson - Minnesota)  2. Insect identification and Biology  With the assistance of members of the Entomology Research  Institute, Ottawa, it has been established that a single species  of Laspeyresia (L. youngana) infests cones of the four species of  spruce, Pi aea g Zaua a ~ P. e ngeZmannii~ P. sitahensis and P . mariana  which are native to British Columbia. L. braateatana, previously  reported in cones of P. sitahensis does not occur in that species.  Laboratory studies are being conducted on the effect of ternÂ­peratur  e and day length as factors affecting termination of diaÂ­pause  in Laspeyresia youngana~ L. piperana and Barbara aolfaxiana  An undescribed species of Barbara has been reared from cones  of Abi es grandis. (Hedlin - British Columbia, Canada)  Work done in the Northern Region in 1971 with cone and seed  insects was limited because of other work priorities. However,  we collected ponderosa, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine  fir, and limber pine cones from several locations in the Region  for insect rearing. Most of the insects collected are still at  the Museum being identified.  Western spruce budworrn were reared from Douglas-fir, EngelÂ­mann  spruce, and subalpine fir cones. The latter two are new  host records as far as we have been able to ascertain. (CieslaÂ­Montana)  The following insects were reared from bristlecone pine  (Pinu s ari stata Engelrn.) cones which were collected in Escalante  Canyon near Antimony, Utah:  COLEOPTERA  Lathridiidae  Cortiaaria sp. (Determined by J. M. Kingsolver)  Scolytidae  Conophthorus edulis Hopkins (Determined by S. L.  Wood)  4  DIPTERA  Cecidomyiidae  Aaynapta keeni (Foote) (Determined by R. J. Gagne)  Chamaemyiidae  Leuaopis sp. (Determined by G. Steyskal)  HYMENOPTERA  Braconidae  Apanteles aristoteZiae Viereck (Determined by  P. M. Marsh)  Braaon sp. (Determined by P. M. Marsh)  Pteromalidae  Aaeroaephala atroviolaaea (Crawford) (Determined  by B. D. Burks)  Dr. Woods stated that although Conophthorus edulis Hopkins  normally occurs in pinyon pine, bristlecone pine is a new, and  probably accidental host. Dr. Gagne reported the Asynapta keeni  (Foote) collection is a first record from this host; however, this  midge has been reared from cones of most Pinus spp. in western  North America. (Moyer - Utah)  A report in the 1970 newsletter on a pinyon pine, Pinus edulis~  cone damage survey listed Hedulia injeativa Heinrich as the damagÂ­ing  insect (Determined by D. M. Weisman). However, a later deterÂ­mination  (by G. T. Okumura) revealed that the larvae were not this  species. Adults have been reared from cones and sent to D. R. Davis  for further determination. (Stipe - Utah)  The Dioryatria spp. of loblolly pine in east Texas were surÂ­veyed  during 1970. Four species were identified: D. amatella~ D.  aZarioraZis~ and two new species. One of the new species was deÂ­termined  to be identical to the so-called southern D. zimmermani.  The results of the study have been accepted for publication in the  Journal of Economic Entomology and should appear shortly after the  first of the year. Drs. Akira Mutuura and Eugene Munroe are coÂ­authors.  (Coulson - Texas)  Adults of 16 parasitic insects were collected from rearing  cages that contained insect-infested pine cones. E~eristes aomÂ­stoakii  (Cress) (Ichneumonidae), Maaroaentris dioryatriae Mues.  (Ichneumonidae) and BZondeZiini sp. (Tachinidae) were the most  common parasites collected from insect-infested cones; more indi-viduals  of all the parasites were collected from insect-infested  slash pine cones than from the cones of any of the other pines.  This latter phenomenon might have been correlated with the rela~ Â·  tively high infestation rate of slash pine cones by D. amatella.  (Neel and Sartor - Mississippi)  5  3. Damage  Mean infestation rates of second-year cones by Dioryatria  amatella in two loblolly pine seed orchards were 10.57% and  23.78% and in one slash pine seed orchard the mean infestation  rate was 25.76%. These infestation rates fluctuated within  seasons and varied significantly among the quadrants of loblolly  pine.  Twenty-eight clones of loblolly pine were screened in two  orchards and 44 clones of slash pine were screened in one seed  orchard for resistance to D. amatella infestation of second-year  cones. Some clones in each orchard appeared resistant, and some  clones appeared highly susceptible.  Data on seed production from D. amatella-infested and nonÂ­infested  cones of loblolly, slash and longleaf pines were obtained  from two seed orchards and one seed production area. Infested lobÂ­lolly  cones yielded an average of 6.16 seeds per cone, and nonÂ­infested  cones yielded an average of 37.37 seeds per cone.  Infested slash cones yielded an average of 4.96 seeds per  cone, and non-infested cones yielded an average of 45.63 seeds per  cone. Infested longleaf cones yielded an average of 4.94 seeds  per cone, and non-infested cones yielded an average of 62.98 seeds  per cone. (Neel and Sartor - Mississippi)  Since the cessation of regular spraying of both hand and windÂ­pollinated  cones used in the genetics program here, the germinable  seed collected has decreased very noticeably, necessitating in many  cases an additional 1 or 2 year wait before adequate amounts of  seed can be obtained for progeny testing or other purposes. (Coyne -  Mississippi)  A limited survey of insect damage to cones of ponderosa pine  was made in the Lincoln, Cibola, and Gila National Forests. The  moderate to poor cone crop in these areas was severely affected  as shown in the table below.  Summary of damage caused by seed and cone insects to ponderosa pine in the  Lincoln, Cibola, and Gila National Forests, New Mexico, 1971.

Dale conducted evaluations of damage by seed and  cone insects in southern Idaho in 1971. An overall average for the  percent of insect infested cones by tree species follows: ponderosa  pine, 18 percent; Douglas-fir, 33 percent; Engelmann spruce, 11  percent; grand fir, 8 percent; subalpine fir, 11 percent; lodgepole  pine, 2 percent; and limber pine, 5 percent. Seed loss was conÂ­siderably  less. The most damaging insects were Laspeyresia spp.  in ponderosa pine, Barbara colfaxiana (Kearfott) in Douglas-fir,  Laspeyresia youngana (Kearfott) in Engelmann spruce, and unidentiÂ­fied  Diptera in grand and subalpine fir, an unidentified Lepidoptera  in lodgepole pine, and a Dioryctria sp. in limber pine. (Parker -  Utah)  Two cone and seed insect studies were initiated in 1971. The  first of these was designed to determine the effect of nitrogen  and phosphorus fertilizer on Douglas-fir cone and seed insect damÂ­age.  Sixteen hundred cones (SO per tree) were collected from 32  36-year-old trees on 1/4 acre fertilizer plots near Yacolt, WashÂ­ington.  Fertilizer treatments had been applied annually between  1965 and 1970 on a plot basis as follows: (1) 70 lbs. phosphorus/  acre; (2) 200 lb. nitrogen/acre; (3) 70 lb. phosphorus plus 200 lb.  nitrogen/acre; and (4) untreated. All cones were sliced and the  number of seed (filled and unfilled) and number of insects on each  cut surface recorded. Only cone midges (Contarinia spp.) were  found in substantial numbers. Results were as follows:  Treatment  Phosphorus  Nitrogen  Phosphorus +  nitrogen  Control  Mean  Av. no. of  midges per  cut surface  2.7  1.8  1.9  1.2  1.9  InsectÂ­damageq  seed!/  %  24.1  13.8  19.2  19.5  19.1  1/ Calculated as number of filled seed  adjacent to one or more midge galls as a  percent of filled seed with no adjacent galls.  The differences among mean number of seed or number of midges  was not significant at the 5 percent level. (Computed F for midge  data= 3.33; tabular F = 3.86.) Variability was understandably  high due to the heavy cone crop in 1971.  '  7  A second study was initiated in 1971 to examine clonal difÂ­ferences  in cone and seed insect damage at Weyerhaeuser's McDonald  Seed Orchard. Â· Cones were collected from eight clones (50 cones per  tree, 5 trees per clone) and examined for insect damage. Average  number of midges (Contarinia spp.) and chalcids per cut cone surÂ­face  were as follows:  Clone No. Chalcids Midges Insect-damaged  seed  (% of filled seed)  1 0.02 2.01 14.3  2 0.43 2.11 18.1  6 0.04 0.34 4.5  8 0.06 0.68 5.1  9 0.04 0.62 9.5  10 0.02 0.76 6.2  16 0.02 0.51 3.0  20 0.04 2.02 14.4  Mean 0.08 1.04 9.4  Statistical analysis has not been completed on the above data,  but clones 1, 2, and 20 appeared to be unusually susceptible to  midge attacks; in addition, clone 2 sustained a substantially higher  chalcid population than any of the other clones. Approximately 10  percent of the seed in the orchard was estimated to be non-extractÂ­able  due to chalcid and midge damage. No control measures were  applied in the orchard this year. (Cade - Washington)  Work on cone insects has been deemphasized, but I still carry  on small-scale ecological studies of Conophthorus resinosae. MatheÂ­matical  models (systems of difference equations) have been develÂ­oped  to describe the interrelationships between flowering, flower  survival, and insect damage to cones. I am attempting to incorporÂ­ate  important climatic variables into these models through their  influence on flowering. The material will be published in about  a year. (Mattson - Minnesota)  4. Control  Research on the use of blacklight traps for the  control of cone-infesting Lepidoptera is continuing.  studies were initiated to evaluate the effectiveness  trap designs and trap location on moth catches.  survey and/or  During 1971  of various  A long-term study was established in cooperation with the  International Paper Company, Mobile, Alabama, to evaluate the  effects of a hardwood barrier-strip on the incidence of insectÂ­caused  cone and seed losses in a slash pine seed orchard. (Merkel -  Florida)  Dioryctria coneworm control results are summarized as folÂ­lows.  8  Two 0.5 percent Gardona hydraulic sprays in the spring gave  good control of Dioryctria coneworms (1.9 percent damaged cones  vs. 17.5 percent for untreated checks) in loblolly pine seed orÂ­chards  in eastern Virginia. Neither 0.5 percent Sevin hydraulic  or 1.5 percent Gardona mist blower sprays were effective. (Basis -  25 trees per treatment with an average of 68 cones/tree.)  Early May treatments with Bidrin injected in bore holes, ala  E. P. Merkel, gave good control of Dioryctria coneworms in a lobÂ­lolly  pine seed production area. Three grams of technical Bidrin  per diameter inch reduced total damaged cones to 7.5 percent and  3.9 percent when applied in 1 and 2 bore holes, respectively.  Check trees had a total of 31.6 percent damaged cones. Lesser  rates were not as effective. (Basis - 6 trees per treatment with  an average of 137 cones/tree.) (Copony- Virginia)  Trunk implants of systemic insecticides were made in seed  orchard slash pine trees in an effort to reduce Dioryctria sp.  infestations of cones. Azodrin and Bidrin were injected on May 7,  1970, the Meta-Systox-R was injected on June 2. Forty trees repreÂ­senting  five clones were included in this test. The average perÂ­cents  of cones infested at harvest from each of the four treatment  groups were as follows: Azodrin 11.0%; Bidrin 20.0%; Meta-Systox-R  33.8%; and untreated control 39.1%.  The best treatment, Azodrin, yielded 55.1 seed/cone compared  to 39.6 for the untreated control. Differences in seed yields  among the clones were non-significant at p(.05.  The slash pine trees were not re-injected in 1971. However,  the mature second-year cones from these trees were examined in  the fall of 1971. There is evidence to indicate from field colÂ­lected  data (presented in the following tabulation) that a residual  effect of Azodrin and Meta-Systox-R was carried over into the second  year:  Total 2nd- Percent Non-infested  Treatment year cones infested 2nd-year cones  Azodrin 201 19 162  Bidrin 107 30 75  Meta-Systox-R 151 20 121  Control 116 28 83  9  Three soil-applied applications of carbofuran (April 1, June  10 and July 8, 1971) applied to sandy soil in the Erambert Seed  Orchard reduced D. amatella second-year cone infestations in the  rarnets of one loblolly clone, South Mississippi loblolly number  9. No appreciable control of this insect was obtained on the  ramets of another clone, South Mississippi loblolly number 8. The  granules were applied uniformly with a lawn fertilizer applicator  under the dripline of each tree. They were worked into the soil  to a depth of 1-2 inches. (Neel and Sartor - Mississippi)  Whereas we're not doing a great deal with cone and seed inÂ­sects  now we do have some results from a test we put in this spring.  This is a repeat of one that we reported on last year. The 0.6 perÂ­cent  water solution of Azodrin applied in early May and again in  late June reduced the cone and seed insect infestation (primarily  Dioryotr i a) from 42 percent in the controls to 10.6 percent. InÂ­festati  ons in parts of the orchard that were sprayed standard sprays  (BHC a t 2 week to 1 month intervals) varied from 20 to 28 percent.  It appears that this material has promise since it has done a good  job 2 years in a row, however, safe techniques of application need  to be worked out before we will recommend its use operationally.  (Johnson - Arkansas)  A chemical control experiment was conducted by MacMillan  Bloedel Ltd. on eight Douglas-fir seed production areas totaling  46 acres in area. Dimethoate at different concentrations and  dilutions was applied by helicopter. Cones were infested by  BarbaiU oolfaxiana and several other species to a lesser extent.  There was little, if any, indication of positive results.  (Hedlin - British Columbia, Canada)  Dimethoate is the only insecticide registered for DouglasÂ­fir  cone and seed insect control. Application rate for hydraulic  applied sprays is 0.5 percent. Analyses of past and 1971 data  indicates that a one percent application rate could buy more harÂ­vestable  seed. See the following table.  There has been a direction change in our Douglas-fir tree  improvement program. Instead of relying on a few selected secondÂ­growth  seed production areas to meet specific needs, emphasis has  now shifted to individual genetically superior trees scattered  over several seed zones and elevation bands. The expected goal  will be to permanently locate and collect improved seed from 30,000  trees on 10 National Forests to meet reforestation needs. Because  of tree accessibility and height, hydraulic spraying will be limÂ­ited.  Dimethoate is registered for hydraulic application only.

CONE AND SEED INSECT NEHSLETTER.!./  February 1973  1. General  The North Carolina State University Tree Improvement Cooperative  has appointed a Seed Protection Committee to investigate ways and means  of reducing cone and seed losses in 3 ,000 acres of seed orchards now in  the program. Seed from these orchards produced in 1971 over 120,000,000  seedlings . These seed lings Hill regenerate over 200,000 acres and at a  modest estimate 10 percent increase in yield could provide 6 million  more dollars at harvest than seedlings grown from regular seed. Although  there are a number of objectives for the committee, the one that we have  concentrated on for 1973 is to conduct a cooperative test in at least  eight orchards of the efficacies of phorate as a granular application  and Gardena as a 0.5 percent hydraulic spray for the control of insects  in loblolly pine cones. Members of the coMmittee are : Torn Dierauf,  Virginia Division of Forestry; Claud O'Gwynn, International Paper ComÂ­pany;  Norman E. Johnson, Weyerhaeuser Company, Chairman; Jim Martin,  American Can Company; Hank Plotkin, North Carolina Forest Service; and  Robert Weir, North Carolina State University. He hope that such an effort  made in several orchards at the same time wil l produce more consistent  results sooner.

The objective of this  informal workshop v1as to discuss the development of accurate sampling  procedure for evaluating insect-caused flmver, cone, and seed losses in  southern pine ~eed orchards. Eventually we hope to st~ndardize sampling  methods so that impact data will be more meaningful for the five major  pine species commonly grown in seed orchards in the large 12-sta t e southÂ­ern  region. Other similar workshops will be held in the future as proÂ­gress  is made and sampling techniques are r efined. (Merkel - Florida)  Research in progress:  The bioenergetics of Douglas-fir cone and seed insects in Idaho .  The goals of this project are : (1) To identify Douglas-fir cone  and seed insects in Idaho and to determine their distribution and relaÂ­tive  abundance and damage; (2) To develop a predictive equation to es=iÂ­mate  cone /seed prod~ct icn and loss; and (3) To ascertain bioenergetic  relationships among insects, cones, and seeds.  ll Contributions submitted by cone and seed insect research workers,  resource Eanagers, and tree improvement specialists . These unpublished  data cannot be used VTithout contribucotÂ· ' s approval . Items assembled by  s. W. Meso, U. S. Forest Service, Portland, Oregon.  2  Cones have been collected from a number of sites throughout Idaho .  Analysis of insects present and damage caused is not ye t complete. In  contrast to the heavy cone crop year of 1971, the 1972 crop in northern  I daho was light or absent \vhile most southern Idaho locations produced  a light to moderate cone crop . A 40-acre intensive study area has been  es t ablished near Potlatch, I daho , with the cooperation of Potlatch ForÂ­ests,  Inc. The test stand is composed of 20 acres of high density  (185 stems/acre) and 20 acres of low density (45 stems/acre) DouglasÂ­fir  , neither half produced cones in 1972 . Exterior and interior cone  t emperatures of an open growing Douglas - fir were measured with thermoÂ­couples.  A multipoint recorder enabled continuous measurements during  the last three weeks of August . These cones were then collected and  stores at -15oc . Cone scales, seeds and insects will be subjected to  semi-micro oxygen bomb calorimetry . (Clausen, Schenk - Idaho)  Seed and cone ins ec t research at New Mexico State University in  1972 was mainly directed toward accumulating additional information  on the biology and cone attack behavior of the more important cone  beetles. Preliminary work was also begun on insects attacking seeds  and cones of Pinion. Permanent plots were es tablished that, for the  next five years, will be used to measure the effects .of weather, inÂ­sects,  and rodents on seed crop fluctuations under New Mexico conditions .  (Kinzer - New Mexico)  Here in North Dakota our area of research concerns insects that are  pests in windbreaks and other types of protective plantings on the Great  PlaJ~s. NPar1v ail nf rhP cnniiPrnus anri riAcidunus olanting stock is  grown in the Great Plains area . We seldom hear of cone and seed insect  problems from the nurserymen, but I am sure that the losses are far  gr eater than we know now. At present, our main concern is for the seed  from the superior trees and from the gene tically improved varieties seÂ­lected  for windbreak purposes . Other problems include the ash seed  weevils, Thsanocnemis spp . , in green ash, Bruchophagus caraganae in  Siberian peashrub or caragana, and weevils in oak and plum. I would be  especially interested in c ontac t with anyone with experience in control  of ash seed weevils . (McKnight - North Dakota)  As predicted , the 1972 cone crops for most species in the Intermountain  Region were poor. The lodgepone pine crop \~as light and only 550 bushÂ­e  l s of cones were collected . There were small quantities of DouglasÂ­fir  , ponderosa pine, and Engelmann spruce cones in the eastern portions  of the Region and almost none in the \vest. Approximately five bushe] s  of cones were collected from each of these three species.  In 1973, there should be a moderate crop of lodgepole pine cones  and very light crops of Douglas - fir, ponderosa pine, and Engelmann spruce  cones . (Parker - Utah~  The 1972 Douglas-fir con~ crop in Oregon and Washington was light  and scattered. An October survey of heavy cone producing west side areas,  found only scattered trees with pollen buds. This indicates that trees  producing cones will not r eceive suff~cient pollen to produce enough seed  for economical collecting. (N~s o - Oregon)  3  Loyd E. Drake, Entomologist, U. S.

Insect Idcnti ficat~on a r.~ B~alcgy  Studies wer e continued concerning the mating behavior of Dioryctria  abietella . A bioassay method was developed to measure male responsiveness  to the female sex pheromone and was used to locate the sex phe r omon~ gland  in the intersegmental fold be t ween the 8th and 9t h abdominal segMents of  female moths . The extent to \V'hich male moths passed through successive  stages of precopulatory behavior was found to be dependent on the concenÂ­tra  tion of sex pheromone . Pheromone responsiveness of males and fema le  production of the pheromone were influenced by diel cycles of 12 hours  of light : 12 hours of darkness (12L: l2D) . The quantity of pheromone  present on abdomonal tips of fema l es decreased during photophase and was  maximum 9 hours after dark during periods of peak calling activity. The  dura t ion of male respons i veness to the pheromone was about twice as l ong  as the period of female r el ease during 12L: l2D photoperi ods . Female proÂ­duction  and r elease of the sex pheromone , as well as w~ l e r espons i veness  to the pheromone, wer e inhibited by light . Periods of locomotor activity  and calling behavior of female moths folloveci a circadian rhythm that  appeared to be endogenously timed but strongly entrained to imposed phot oÂ­periods.  Chemicals which stimulated feeding by larvae of Dioryctria abietella  were extr acted wit h acetone f r om conelets of slash pine. Ether solubleÂ­and  water soluble- fractions of the acetone ext ract elicited a continuous  Â· larval feeding response only ""'hen recombined. Sugars were also found to  induce larval feeding and their effectiveness as feeding stii]lUlants was  increased by addition of the ether soluble fract i on of the acetone extract .  4  Exploratory studies on the sex attractants and host attractants  of Dioryctria amatella were initiated this past fall. Traps baited  with live virgin female moths and with l-inch discs cut from fusiform  branch galls of slash pine were tested in a slash pine seed production  area near Olustee , Florida . Males of Q. a~Etella were captured in the  traps baited l-lith live female moths lvhereas only female mo ths were  caught in the traps baited with discs c.ut from fusiform galls. During  additional tests, Q. amate lla moths lÂ·lere not caught in traps that had  been baited with one of five commercially available monoterpenes (aÂ­pinene,  B-pinene, limonene, myrcene, or phellandrene) . Further field  testing of traps baited with live virgin females and discs cut from  fusiform galls is planned for the coming year . We are currently develÂ­oping  methods for identifying terpenes emitted from galls and cones of  slash pine. These terpenes will be added to the field tests as they  are identified. (Fatzinger - Florida)  A midge, Contarinia sp ., was found infesting needles of loblolly  pine throughout the Eramber t Seed Orchard, Mississippi, during the late  summer and fal l of 1971 and 1972 . The midge does not cause a basal  swelling of the needles as do many other species of this genus . It feeds  beneath the sheath causing lesions on tender young needles . The needle  bends do,Ynward at the point of the lesion as it grows out of the fascicle .  Severe infestations cause dropping of needles . Some trees were heavily  defoliated by late summer 1971; however, foliage grew back the next year.  The Nantucket pine tip moth was found completing its entire l arval  ,.tf',.~,""~""'""'""t- ;&gt;nl'l rnnpt-; n~ â€¢. ,.;t-h; , 1nb}nl l~r n;no n&lt;&gt;orlioc: ~t- rhP RratnhPrt""  Seed Orchard, Mississippi . This is very unusual since, in the South,  tip moth. larvae usually feed on small needles only during their first  instar. After molting to the second instar, they migrate up the shoot,  and form a web. They bore into the tip about the fourth instar and comÂ­plete  development there . Dr . B. F. McLemore (Southern Forest Experiment  Station) has lvritten a scientific note (Jour . of Econ. Ent., in Press)  concerning. discovery of the June beetle, Phyllophaga micans (Knoch)  feeding on loblolly pine cones mainly during pollen reception and shcrtly  thereaf ter . Numerous adults of this insect were caught in light traps  in the same orchard in which conelet feeding was observed. (Pierce -  Louisiana)  A list of all insect species collected fr~m all the major conifer  tree species in New Mexico over the last several years has been compiled  and will be published in the next few months .  A study of Conoohthorus Jlexilis has shown that the adults overwinter  in limber pine cones in both the tree and on the ground . The females  make the initia l cone attack on developing cones the follm-1ing spring . If  a male foliows the female into the cone, the female constructs an egg galÂ­lery.  If the mal~ does not enter the cone, the ga llery is either not conÂ­structed  or very short . An average of 1.25 cones is attacked by each  female. Attacked cones have an average of 17 eggs per cone . There r~ y  Â· be as many as t:hree females and three egg galleries per cone . Â· In the  5  pre-overwintering adult stage, populations average 13 per cone. PostÂ­wintering  adults average eight per cone , however, only 4 . 6 adults per  cone emerge to attack the developing conelets in the spring . This  survival rate per cone is 18 times greater than that of the ponderosa  pine cone bee t le QÂ£pderosae (Ropk.). This i s attributable to the less  formidable conditions affecting the portic~ of Conophthorus -killed  limber pine cones that fall to the ground as compared to the more severe  conditions affecting Conophthorus- killed ponderosa pine cones which reÂ­main  on the tree .  Cross mating studies have shmm that .Â£. ponderosae and .Â£. flexilis are  distinct species and wi ll not interbreed even in caged studies â€¢ .Â£.  flexili! will, however, attack and lay viable eggs on ponderosa pine  cones under caged conditions â€¢ .Â£. ponderosae females wi l l attack and  feed on limber pine cones but a very short or no egg gal l ery is conÂ­structed  and no eggs are laid .  Earlier laboratory tests had indicated that myrcene and B- pinene  repelled and attracted, respectively, adult female .Â£. ponderosae.  Vapors of these ~terials were presented to attacking fema l es by  being liberated through a sealed polyethylene tube around the base of  the conelet. In these preliminary tes ts, there was no increase of deÂ­crease  in cone attack in the presence of eit her vapor. (Kinzer - New  Mexico)  Cone and seeci insects continue to flourish in the central Rockv  Mountain area, and ar e even attracting some additional attention .  Seed midges have been implicated inÂ· the past 2 years as adverse  factors in studies on regener ation of Engelmann spruce . Specifically  losses caused by the midges are interfering with attempts to estimate  seed production.  Work is continuing on t he insect complex affecting ponder osa pine  cones and seeds on the Fr ont Range of the Rockies . Main speci es identiÂ­fied  so far include Diorvctria cambiicola,~ rossi, Q. abietivorella ,  Q. auranticella, Conophthorus ponderosa~, Conotrachelus neomexicanus,  and Koerber's ubiquitous cone bug . This work is the subject of a study  unden1ay a t Colorado State University, and will shortly appear in the  form of a }1S t hesis by Judy Bodenham. (Stevens - Color ado)  The following new species of cone and seed insects were collected  in t he Intermouncain Region:  Grand fir and Douglas - fir  Brachineura n . sp .

Damage  Our program has dropped cone and insect survey work. Incidenta l  occurrences of seed or cone injury are re por t ed as part of survey reÂ­sults  for other purposes . This season we did find evidence of Eastern  spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem. ) wor king in spruce cones  within a whit e spr uce seed collection area in the Ottawa National Forest ,  Michigan. No formal evaluation of the damage or impact has been made .  (Hastings - 1-1innesota)  Seed bugs of t he genus, Leptoglossus, are in Arkansas . I found  them in abundance feeding on cones of shortleaf pine in the vicinity of  Hot Springs . (Johnson - Arkansas)  Conelet abortion accounts for a major portion of the mortality of  first-year cones on l ongleaf, loblolly and shortleaf pines. Conelet  losses of from 10 to 50 percent or mor e of the first - year cone crop have  been reported . In the past, the cause(s) of conelet abortion wer e unÂ­known  thus l eading t o such terms as ""physiological drop , 11 ""poop-out,""  etc. However , in some of our recent work we wer e able to show that feed Â­ing  by Leptoglossuc nymphs c ~uses shortle~f anr. loblolly conelets to  aoorc, wn1Le cne pcocecL1on OL cone lecs Lcoru ndcuraL ~ug povuLKCLons w1~n  screen cages prevented abortion . It is unlikely that all of the conelet  abortion which occurs on the southern pines is the result of feeding by  seed bugs, but our experiments have demons trated that the potential for  such destruction is inherent to these s ucking insects . Conelet abortion  can no longer be considered solely a tree physiology problem.  Studies of the effect of Leptoglossus on second- year cones and seed  of shortleaf and loblolly pine cones and seed were made using caged cone  clusters. Adult bugs were allowed to feed for specific time intervals  on specific cone clusters ear l y, mid , and late in the growing season.  Seed yields and quality from infested clusters and from unprotected cones  were compared with cones protected throughout the season f r om bug feeding .  We found that bug feeding, particularly ear ly in the season, or thr oughÂ­out  the season by natural populations drastically reduced both seed yields  and quality. Seeds damaged early in the season, be fore hard seed- coats  developed abor ted, resulting in fewer seed per cone at harvest. Protected  loblolly cones yielded 2- 1/2 times as many i i lled seed as did cones ~x Â­posed  to natural bug populations, and almost 6 times as many full seed as  cones exposed to 2 weeks of bug feeding early in the seascn .  In. simil ar work Dave Bramlett, plant physiologist at Blacksburg ,  Va., found that Virginia pine cones protected by scr een wire cages yi elded  an average of 57 sound seed per cone in contrast to slightly more than 12  sound seed in unprotected cones . Caging reduced the number of unfilled  seed per cone from 18 to 9 . ~~ and Leptoglossus were the primary  insects suspected of causing the damage . (DeBarr - Georgia)  7  Populations of Leptoglossus occid~ntalis, conifer seed bug , moved  into the Dor ena Seed Orchard which ' produces blister r ust-resistant  western white pine seed and seedlings for limited reforestation . The  anticipated influx was related to the lack of cones in the adjacent  natura l Douglas-fi r stands . Fortunate ly, there is only one generation  per year. Adults overwinter and become ac tive in Nay when the second-Â·  year cones are elongating . Full cone growth is reached by late June  before nymphs begin appea~ing . Nymphs feed during July and August  mainly on the maturing second-year cones . An attempt was made to  evaluate seed bug feeding impact by cag.ing spec ific numbers of nymphs  to individua l cones , but seed set of open and hand- pollinated cones  was not sufficient for significant comparisons . (Meso - Oregon)  Dan Kucera recently completed his dissertation on ""Cone and Seed  Losses in Loblolly Pine."" Loblolly pine orchards were sampled in  cent~al Louisiana and east Texas . Ma j or areas of study were :  Life t abl e - grea t es t l osses in first year cones occurred in March  through May during the two-year s tudy (1969 -1970) . Conelets withÂ­stood  very little feeding during pollination and shortly thereafter .  Greatest losses in second- year cones occurred during June-July with  a l esser loss in September through October .  Causes of Cone Loss - Dioryctria spp . coneworms were the s ingle reost  important cause of cone mortality and also cone damage . Next in  importance were undoubtedly the cone bugs Leptoglossus corculus and  TeJYfft Qipunctat~ .  Weather - During the summer months levels of rainfall can also cause  numerous conelets to drop . In 1971, some loblolly pine trees dropped  all their fir st- year cones in east Texas . (Pierce - Louis i ana)  Prior to the harvest of s l ash pine cones in 1972, all the cones  and conelets were tagged and counted on five trees (38 to 48 feet tall)  in a seed production area near Olustee , Florida. This ,.,as done as an  initial study to determine the effect of mechanical cone shakers on  the cone and conelet crops . The same trees were shook in September  1972 to determine if there was any tendency for second-year cones to  hang on the tree . This aspect was investigated because the cones reÂ­moved  by a shaker are sometimes used to eval uate the success of a  control technique against Dioryctria moths . The cones left on the tree  may hang because they are attacked , thus reducing the precision of the  biological observation.  In 1971, 79 percent of the second-year cones were r emoved oy  shaking (range 70 to 85 percent) and in 1972, 64 percent were removed  (range 48 to 91 p0rcent) . In 1971, 62 , 3, 53 , 10 and 25 percent of  the conele ts were r emoved by shaking . This resulted from the branch  ends being broken by hi gh intensity vibrations .  8  The following table summarizes the percent of attacks by  Dioryctria in the cones removed and kept on the tree. In only one  case (Tree No . 5) would the attacked cones left on the tree have made  a difference. (Hertel - Florida)  Tree Number  1 2 3 4 5  # Cones harvested 25 174 176 161 65  % attack 16 3 5 4 15  # Cones left on tree 24 186 17 74 43  % attack 13 6 41 4 49  % All cones attacked 14 5 8 4 29  Collections from conifers in North Dakota indicated that lepiÂ­dopterous  borers are well represented. With continued emphasis of  planting spruce and pine on the Great Plains, species of Dioryctria  have reached a new level of importance. The genus Dioryctria contains  some of the most economically important moths affecting coniferous  tree species. Their potential for destruction extends to existing  provenance studies of ponderosa pine as well as to proposed pine seed  orchards of the future . Dioryctria cambiicola, Q. tumicolella, and  p. gul9sella were reared from oonderosa oine. An actack bv )&gt; - cambiiÂ­cola  predisposes the tree to infestation by the Zimn1erman pine moth,  ~Â· zimmermani. Dioryctria disculsa was found attacking Scotch pine,  and this species could prove to be a major pest of the proposed Scotch  pine seed orchard.  Siberian larch is another highly desirable tree species being  evaluated to develop planting recommendations. A larch stand on the  Denbigh Experimental Forest is used for seed production. During the  1971 field season Dioryctria abietivorella infested approximately 15  percent of the cone crop with a distinct preference for certain trees.  Self-pollination predominates and results in low production of viable  seed. A 15 percent cone infestation could result in a severe reduction  in seed availability. Cone infestations ranging from 60 to 90 percent  are recorded in Russian literature. (McKnight - North Dakota)  During the past three seasons, over 35 species of insects have  been collected fron1 grand fir and alpine fir cones in northern Idaho .  The most destructive pes ts are Dioryctria abietella (D & S), Eucosma  spp., Hylemya Sp ., 2nd Earomyia sp . Asynapta keeni (Foote) is found  in large numbers, but damage to cones appears to be minimal . ~To more  cecicls form galls on scales and on seeds of grand fir; one cecid feeds  in the ~nterior of alpine fir seed and can be detected by cutting open  seeds or. by x-ray.  9  Three methods were used to evaluate cone and seed damage: axial  slice, follm.;ed by whole cone counts; dissection of seeds; and x-ray  of seeds. Regression lines will be calculated from these data .  Three methods to count cones from the ground with binoculars were  tested: Cones were counted on the largesc cone bearing br anch , the  top whorl of the tree and the south side of the tree . These binocular  counts were regressed against total cone counts obtained f r om climbing  the tree. Regression analyses were run for each method; providing the  following equations :  Largest cone bearing branch (X1) to total count (Y):  Y = 13. 929 + 6 . 419Xl r2 = .2290 mean = 60 . 00  std. error = 52 .11  Cones on top whorl (X2) to total count ( Y) :  Y = -. 0651 = 3 . 394X2 r2 = .719 mean = 60.03  std. error = 31 .42  Cones on south side (X3) to total count (Y):  Y = - 5 . 620 + 2.994X3 r2 = . 769 mean= 59 .40  std. error = 28.93  The 1972 cone crop for grand fir and alpine fir was very poor .

David identified  them as Melissopus latiferreanus (Walsingham). (Stipe - Utah)  4. Control  Based on the results of 1971 tests, two 0 . 5 percent Cardona sprays  reduced Dioryctria da~gc from 17 .5 percent to 1 .9 percent , where GarÂ­dona  insecticide used for operational control of Dioryctria in a lobÂ­lolly  pine seed orchard . Low overall Dioryctria activity in 1972 (8.2  percent second- year cones damaged) made the results less striking than  in 1971. Treated trees received either two sprays (May 14 and June 14)  or one spray (May 14) of a 0 . 5 percent Gardena spray applied hydrauliÂ­cally.  (Copony - Virginia)  Data from the most heavily attacked clones are presented below.

The results of this test were discouraging because there  were no responses to the bark applications and only negligible r e Â­sponses  t o the Azodrin and Bidrin implan t s . Most of t he bark was  shaved from an 18-inch band before an i nsecticide was painted on a  10  . test tree. The inject ions t hi s year were made in holes bor ed in the  trunks about an inch above the gr ound level .

(Neel -Mississippi)  In a test of Gardena applied as 0 .5 percent spray with a mist blowÂ­er  to the point of runoff a t two da t es, May 15, and June 15, Weyer haeus Â­er  Company achieved good control of coneworms in their loblolly seed  orchard at Washington, North Carolina. The infestation rate in the unÂ­treated  checks was 38 percent and tha~ f rom the sprayed ar eas 8 percent .  (Johnson - Arkansas)  FURADAN Â® (carbofuran) 10 percent granules were applied once on  May 4, 1972, at the rate of six (6) pounds per tree in a young slash  pine seed or chard in northeast Florida to control Dioryct r ia spp . The  grass was mowed immediately prior to spr ead ing the granules on the s.oil  sur face \&lt;lithin the crown projection; t hen t he granules were covered with  the grass c l ippings to minimize their exposure to birds . Dior yctria  a ttacks on first- year cones only were used to evaluate treatmen t effect  because the second-year cone crop was extr emely low. The expe rimental  11  design consisted of a treated tree (ramet) paired with another unÂ­treated  ramet of the same clone anÂ·d this was replicated 15 times with  each replicate representing a different clone. No differences in  mean conelet survival from early May to late August, nor in percentage  conelets attacked by coneworms, could be detected between treated and  untreated trees . (Merkel - Florida)  Feeding damage by Dioryctria was quite serious in the Jefferson,  Oregon, Seed Orchard- -both in cones and frost damaged terminals . Cones  were sprayed three times during the gr owing season with 1.0 percent  Lindane. \.Jhere spraying was done, only 14 percent of the cone bearing  trees and 4 percent of the cones were infested; in a nonsprayed control  area, 82 percent of the cone bearing trees and 20 percent of the cones  were infested . Sprayed cones averaged 22 percent more seed per cone.  A l arge population of Leptoglossus occidentalÂ£s was discovered on  one heavy bearing tree in a nonsprayed portion of Jefferson Seed Orchard.  Seed damaged by Leptoglossus was easily identified on x - rays by the  shriveled appearance of the endosperm. X-ray analysis of the seed from  this tree and that of another ramet of the same clone from a LindaneÂ­sprayed  portion of t he orchard is as follows:  Percent Percent Lepto- Number  Filled Empty gloss us - damaged of  Tree Seed Seed Seed Cones  Kncwn  Leptoglossus U. :l ~2.'1 17 .u )lj  present  ,.

These compounds will be tested in 1973  when the crop outlook is favorable. (Cade - Washington)  We have been using Guthion in place of BHC on our breeding trees  in order to comply with regulations . One big drawback down here in the  use of insecticides with higher mammalian toxicity is the virtual imÂ­possibility  of applicators to wear protective clothing during the summer  months, thereby hindering spraying operations considerably . I am beÂ­ginning  to believe that in view of present regulations, the best control  is no control--that is, let the insects have what they will, but inÂ­crease  t he area of seed orchards or the number of breeding trees accordÂ­ingly.  (Coyne - Hississippi)  for  were  Pest  Field tests comparing hydraulic and air blast speed sprayer methods  applying dimethoate insecti cide for Nantucket pine tip moth control  conducted by Neil Overgaard of the Alexandria Field Office, Forest  Nanagement Group , Pineville , Louisiana, during the summer of 1972 .  12  Preliminary results at the Stuart Orchard showed 4 percent shoot  mortality on the areas sprayed with the hydraulic method and 20 perÂ­cent  on those sprayed with the air blast method . Percent tips inÂ­fested  with tip moths averaged 0.7 percent on the hydraulic sprayed  areas and 5.6 percent on the air blast sprayed areas.

IC...XO  Greetings to our Forest Visitors:  You are welcome to enter our Idaho timberlands for hunting, fishing, berry-picking,  camping, hiking, skiing-with certain exceptions. Active logging areas may be  closed for public safety. Some areas may be closed by State law during extreme  fire danger. Shooting of firearms is prohibited in or near townsites, picnic and  campgrounds, logging operations, and some areas under grazing lease.  We ask your cooperation in observing these few restrictions for your own safety  and that of our forest employees. Also, please be careful with smoking and fires,  even in the fall of the year when conditions may not seem critical to you. Never  leave a camp or warming fire untended.  We understand some people are not aware that P. F. I.'s policy has always  been to permit free use of its timberlands by the public for recreation. ConÂ·  sequently, as a public service we have, for several years, published free maps covÂ·  ering most of our Idaho operating area.  These maps show the few gates known to exist on P. F. I. roads at the time  of map publication. You may find some gates not shown or on lands of other  owners. Please see the Clearwater map for explanation.  While P. F. I. owns and manages for multiple use a little over 300,000 acres of  land in the area covered by the two maps, this is only about 20% of the total  area. The balance is owned by the state and federal governments and by other  private companies and individuals.  Although not included in this year's hunting and fishing packet, several brochures  of particular interest to sportsmen and forest land recreationists are available on  request from P. F. I. Write to Public Relations Dept., Potlatch Forests, Inc.,  Lewiston, Idaho.  If you find these maps and information interesting and useful, we would appreciÂ·  ate hearing from you.

Photo made from film prepared for visitors to Cradle of Forestry  ""T HIS is the last issue o£ Bilt­more  Doings. There will not  be any more doings to report  on."" Such was the New Year's mes­sage  sent out in 1914 from Darm­stadt,  Germany, by Carl Alwin  Schenck, Director of Biltmore Forest  School, in a farewell gesture to his  1913 class of ""Biltmore Boys""-a  class which, incidentally, was in  Marshfield, Oregon, awaiting him.  His gesture, in reality, amounted to  an obituary, signaling the death of  his nationally famous forestry school.  Biltmore Doings were reports to the  Pink beds of the Cradle of }'orestry where first scientific for estry in America was practiced, ncar Asheville, North Carolina  alumni, keeping them po~ted on the  ''doi ngs"" of Schenck and his fo restry  swdents. And the "" no more doings""  letter, sent to students and friends  in forestry and allied industries, was  intended by Schenck to be his and  the school's Schwanncnlicd, or swan  song.  Nineteen years before, at the age  of 27, he had been summoned from  hi1. native Germany to serve as for­ester  on George \V. Vanderbilt's vast  Biltmore Estate in wes tern North  Carolina and as he free ly admitted,  ""The best fortune J could have met  with an) where became mine in  America: fine fields to work in; good  health to enjoy; eno ugh to live on ;  and lots of friendship.""  lie quickly ca pitali1ed on his  good fortune. \Vithin three years  he had not only proven his ability  as a professional forester but had, in  the autumn of 1898, opened the  door to American forestry educa­tion  by establishing the Biltmore  Forest School, using the Vanderbilt  forests for a campus. Gifi'ord Pin­chot,  who preceded him as Biltmore  forester, had been urging the crea-tion  of a school of forestry at the  univer~ity level and Bernard E. Fer­now,  fellow Gennan, had lectured  briefly on technical forestry at Mass­achusetts  Agricultu ral College, 1887,  but Schenck's forestry school was  truly a pioneering venture. His em­phasis  and philosophy was different  from tha t proposed by Pinchot and  that instituted almost simultaneously  by Fernow at Cornell Uni versity.  \\ 'herea1. they proposed a four year  tlzemy oriented university curricu­lum,  he establi shed a school in prac­tical  forestry, with his students be-  ing exposed to a twelve months  combination of classroom lectures  and field work. His classroom and  woods philosophy, ""That forestry is  best which pays best,"" won him  many friends among the lumbermen.  1ntere~t ingly, the educational  views of Fernow, Schenck, and Pin­chot  were jointly presented in an  1899 American Forestry Association  symposium, ""The Training of Pro­fessional  Foresters in America"". In  it Fernow took a vigorous slap at  Schenck's practical forestry by stat­ing  that ""The attempt to satisfy the  popular but ignorant cry for so­called  practical instmction usually  leads to the production of superfi­cial  and incompetent practitioners,  lacki ng a safe guide in thorough  knowledge, although by no means  lacking in self assu rance."" He also  advised ""any student of forestry in  this country, as well as in any other,  to Ia) as broad a foundation of  theoretical knowledge as he can  afford; he wi 11 be more successful in  the end with his practice.""  Schenck, with a German Doctor  of Philosophy degree in forestry,  fended the slap, usi ng a practical  defense: ""The American forester,  being employed for busi ness pur­poses,  musi be well acquainted above  all with the economic conditions of  the various sections of the United  States, and more especially with  the ir lumber interests. The more  time he spends traveling in the  woods, in the lumber camps, in saw­mills  and wood-working establish­ments,  the better for him. Knowl-edge  thus acqu ired will be more  valuable to him, the business for­ester,  th an a thorough acquaintance  with chemistry, physics, zoology,  minera logy, geology and mathemat­ics,  with which forest students are  packed fu ll in Europe."" He then  deftly jabbed his point home: ""It is  as little feasible to study forestry  from books at a university alone, as  it is po~s ible for the physicia n to  become a master in his branch unless  he has large ex perience in clinic  and hospital work.""  Pinchot, jumping into the affray,  contended that the ""forest student  most have some knowledge of physi­cal  science, a good working acquaint­ance  with the theory of forestry, and  a considerable experience with the  forest itself under a variety of con-  Vanderbilt Estate as it must have  looked at the turn of the century  Restored black forest style cabin now II...  has forest history displays for visitors ,..  ~ Artist's conception of way the Cradle  ""'IIII will look from air when completed  ditions."" He also cut at Schenck's  scheme, in two ways. He began by  announcing that ""The first step, in  my judgment, should be a college  or university trammg, wherever  that is possible."" Secondly, he made  a statement which gave partial sup­port  to Schenck's concept of practi­cal  forestry ed ucation: ""Indeed, it  will be well, in all cases, for the  forest student to begin practical  work before plungi ng too deeply  into his theoretical training."" But  he immediately offered another com­ment,  well calculated to jeopardize  Schenck's likelihood of securing the  most highly qualified students: ""For  this purpose (theoretical training]  the position of student assistant in  the Division of Forestry, United  States Department of Agriculture,  offers a valuable opportunity to a  few well qualified men to become  acquainted with the true nature of  forest work."" And to insure the at­tractiveness  of his offer he added,  ""Students are paid at the rate ~f  S300 per annum, and all field ex­penses  are borne by the Division.""  This d isparity in educational con­cepts  continued to widen over the  ensuing years with disastrous re­sults  for Schenck but in the mean­time  to him there flocked a variety  of young men, largely from New  England and the Midwest, seeking  forestry ed ucation. Treating them  more as apprentices than as aca­demic  schohu·s, their master involved  each in a swdy-work program which  complemented classroom presenta­tion  with the physical side of for­estry:  care of nurseries, transplant­ing  of seedlings, timber selection,  felling, logging, sawing, etc. Thus,  at the end of the year the student  was expected to have a few knowl­edgeable  callouses to aid his text­book  theories. And if he successfully  passed the final examination and  served a credita ble apprenticeship  for six months in some field of fo r­estry  he could receive a Bachelor  of Forestry degree. Further appren­ticeship,  capped with a publishable  research paper reporting and evalu­ating  some forestry problem might  entitle him to a Forest Engineer de­gree,  conditioned always on the  master's approval.  Under this program Schenck's  graduates received a warm welcome  from governmental agencies and  private industry. Thus, for a few  years his forestry school was a suc­cess.  But two situations arose which  eventually led to the abandonment  of the Biltmore Forest School: part­ing  of the ways between Schenk and  Vanderbilt, coupled with continu­ing  opposition from men like Fer­now  and Pinchot and an accom­panying  rash growth of rival fo restry  schools.  The break with Vanderbilt oc­curred  in 1909 as a result of several  factors. Over the years Schenck had  had a rather abrasive relationship  with other members of Vanderbilt's  managerial staff and this was aggra­vated  by worsening economic con­ditions  which, according to Schenck,  caused Vanderbilt to become ""sick  of forestry."" He, therefore, instruct­ed  Schenck to sell Pisgah Forest,  offering him a 10 percent commis­sion.  The forester's reaction was one  of shock: ""I was in utter despair.  My life work was hopelessly de­stroyed.  \\' hat was a commiss ion of  10 percent for me who had never  worked for money?""  In the meantime Vanderbilt de­parted  for Europe but before he  returned Schenck found what he  thought was a highly acceptable al­ternative  to selling Pisgah: he leased  the hunting and fishing r ights in the  southern half of the forest to a  sportsman's club for an annuity of  $ 10,000, payable in advance. To  Schenck's d ismay, ""Mr. Vanderbilt,  Another restored cabin for ben efit of  visitors to Cradle, this one is typical  of Appalachian mountaineer style homes  Visitor Information Center at Cradle receives thousands of visitors daily  Films on history of forestry in United States arc shown daily at Information Center  Members of AFA's Board of Directors view future plans for Cradle of Forestry  returning to Biltmore in spring  I 909, treated me like a criminal, or  at least like a man who had utterly  abused his confidence."" Vanderbilt,  vellli ng h is d ispleasure, called  Schenck an "" Id iot!"" and d ismissed  him. Thus, sa id the viCLim, ""I had  lost my working field and my Bilt­more  Forest School had lost its work­ing  fie ld, and-which is more im­portant-  the USA had lost its first  tree (arm.""  The dismissal and subsequen t  severance of relations with the Van­derbi  lt estate did not immediately  ring the death knell on the Biltmore  Forestry School. Instead, the d irector  convened it into an ambulatory in­stitution  with an iti nerary which in­cluded  study in all the major lumber  producing areas of the Un ited States  as wel l as a semester abroad, featur­ing  forestry in Germany. This ap­proach  was greatly faci lita ted by  many courtesies provided by the  lumber interests.  The system worked well at first,  with about 40 young men enrolled,  hut by 1913 the number seeking ad­miss  ion was so small that Schenck  became convinced that he (aced  eventual fail ure. T his d isconcert­ing  condition was closely related to  another: as early as 1903 Pinchot  had urged George \\'. Vanderbilt to  close out Schenck's Biltmore Forest  School. The reasons beh ind this  were multi ple, but Pinchot and Fer­now,  among others, kept harpi ng on  the theme that Schenck's type of  school was totally inadequate for  producing the caliber of foresters  which federal, state, a nd private for­estr)  would demand. Both Pinchot  and Fernow urged the establishmen t  of a lour yea r forest ry curriculum at  the uni versities. Fernow backed his  urging by moving from Chief of  Division of Forestry, United States  Departmen t of \ griculture, to Cor­nell  Uni\'ersity where in 1898, as  director ami dean, he organited the  :o\ew York State College o( Forestry  ami quickly began tu rning out col­lege  bred fo res ters.  Meanwhile, Pinchot, now head of  the Division o[ Forestry, was un­happy  with both Schenck's and Fer­now's  contributions to forestry ed u­cation.  Speaking of Schenck's school  he sneered that "" lt had l ittle aca­demic  sta ndi ng"" and added tha t "" \Ve  in the d ivision of Forestry fully rec-  ognized the necessity for professional  education in forestry in this country,  but we had small confidence in the  leadership of Dr. Fernow or Dr.  Schenck."" Pinchot's reasoning be­hind  this statement reflected ex·  treme American chauvinism rather  than the cosmopolitan attitude that  might ha\'e been expected from a  forester whose basic knowledge was  partially acquired in European for­ests  and schools: '7e disu·usted  them and thei1 German lack of faith  in American forestry. \Vhat we  wanted was American foresters  trained by Americans in American  ways for the work ahead in Ameri­can  forests.""  From this point of view Pinchot  and Henry Solon Graves, his bosom  associate in the Division of Forestry,  talked the situation over and de­cided  that since the kind of forest  school that would meet the needs  of the Division did not exist, the  establishment of such a school was  an absolute necessity. And in their  eyes Yale University was the place  for it, as both were Yale graduates.  Following up the idea, the president  of Yale was approached about the  plan, gave immediate approval, ac­cepted  $150,000 in endowment from  the Pinchot family i.'S a starter, and  opened Yale Forest School in the  fall of 1900, with Graves as profes­sor  of forestry. Soon other forestry  schools appeared at various univer­sities  and all began recruiting stu­dents.  The accumulative impact of  this and the other factors was the  basis for Schenck's ""There will not  be any more Doings"" and for the  subsequent demise of his school. •  lln the next installment Historian  .Jolley shows how Bilunore students  reacted predictably to the farewell  letter. A member of the class of  1913 tearfully read the last Doings  and wrote a friend, "" ... Damn this  80-acre forestry taught at Yale,  Michigan, Idaho, O.A.C. ... "" But  as you shall see, the last had not  been heard of Dr. Schenck. To quote  Propertius, Elegies: Quod si de­ficiant  vires, audacia ce1·te laus  erit: in magnis et voluisse sat est,  which freely translated means:  ""Though strength be wanting, my  daring is sure to win me praises; in  great undertakings it is meritorious  even to have a will.""

Jolley  Young people seem to have been  drawn to the first installment of  Mr. Jolley's article. One asked,  ""Why &lt;&gt;ouldn't they make a go  of it? It seems to have been a  different kind of college where  the students got personal atten­tion.""  This is a question no lay  editor should attempt to answer.  As you will see, Dr. Fernow, of  AF A, called the school a ""peda­gogic  abortion"" in the most un­kind  cut of all. But despite its  short duration and its smallness,  the school rlid have tremendous  impact. People still talk about it.  The students heard lectures in  the morning and rode around the  estate in the afternoon as Schenck  attended to the estate's forestry  affairs. On occasion, the school  moved to Oregon and on several  Dr. Carl Alwin Schenck instructs a group of students in the field.

After 1\'lr. joJJey completes  his presentation in this issue and  the next, perhaps some trained  teacher will attempt to answer the  question raised, ""Why couldn't  they make a go of it?"" Editor  WHY did Dr. Schenck throw  in the sponge? Foreseeing  the reaction to the shut­down  of the school he presented a  full argument to explain his ac­tions  in typical Schenck language.  He reminded them how, after  splitting with Vanderbilt, he had  centered ""all my nerve and sinew  and energy and all my hopes on the  development of a really American  Forest School."" And he reempha-sit.  ed his philosophy of forestry edu­cation  as represented by the Biltmore  Forest School: ""That school was not  meant to be an institution of the  usual kind, viz. a school attached  to a college away from the woods, a  school preaching conservation and  second growth and theory. No! My  Biltmore Forest School wa~ meant  to be a practical and technical  school, the teachings of which, not­ably  in lumbering and in financing,  might be capa ble of immediate ap­plication  in the American woods; it  was to be a training school for the  sons of every lumberman and of  every timber owner in the country.""  But, he concluded mournfully, ""Jt  was to be; it has not been.""  Initially, it was the only forest  school in America. Yet in the brief  span o( 15 years more than 83 Amer­ican  schools had entered the arena  of forestry education, siphoning off  Schenck's potential recruits. Hence,  he lamented, ""There seems to be  no more need of a unique school  like the Biltmore Forest School.""  Ironica lly, poor Schenck was in a  seme the victim of the very thing  which had promoted him in the first  place-a growi ng awareness of the  need for conservation and for scien­tific  management of our natural re­sources.  His Biltmore Forest School's  life span, 1898-191 3, practically co­incided  with the almost revolution­ary  conservation movement sparked  by men like Pinchot and Theodore  Roosevelt. This period of progre~­sivism  spawned multiple conserva­tion  movements and institutions, all  Some of the early equipment used by forester, at the turn of the century which can be  seen on display 111 the Cradle of Forestry in the Pisgah Nntionnl Forest, Asheville, N.C.  Members of the last (1913 ) class of the Biltmore J.'orcst School after it moved to Coos Bay, Oregon. Fifteen have been  identified, one is unknown. Dr. Schenck is fifth from the le ft, standing.

Shawhan, Carol D. Stowe, L. Emans Sulton, Charles E. Wells, and T. Sterl Zimmerman  intended to cope with and stay the  ruthless ex ploitation of our national  resources. The raft of newly born  forestry schools, whose rise Schenck  was bemoaning, was part of that  spawn and his forestry school was  an unwilling victim .  In the meantime, a constantly de­creasing  enrollment convinced him  that continuance of the school was  neither worthwhile nor ""in keeping  with the dignity of the interests  which I have advocated incessantly.""  By th ii&gt; he had reference to the fact  that, as forester for George '""'· Van­derbilt  and as Director of Biltmore  Forest School, his fores try philosophy  had aLLai ned and enjoyed the priv­ileges  of national prominence-pri\ ­ileges  now rapidly "" ';llling. Hence he  prelerred to withdraw while he and  his school still enjoyed a good repu­tation.  Also shapi ng his decision was a  problem common to many schools,  then and now-finance. The Bilt­more  Forest School had never had  any endowments or permanent pro­visions  for support. It had operated  on the Biltmore estate solely from  student fees aml even half of them  had to be turned over to Vanderbilt.  Later, it survived on tuition fees  supplemented by gratuities from the  lumber interests. Th us, as Schenck  told his students and friends, ""The  Biltmore Forest School has had  nothing to support it except the  good will, tree from any financial  obliga tions, first of G. \'\'. Vander­bilt's  Biltmore Estate, and there­after  of such firms as Cummer-Dig­gi  ns &lt;lt Cadillac, ~lichigan , of C. A.  ~mith , at Marsh field, Oregon, of  .J. L. R oper of Norfolk ... l I ad we  50 such friends instead o f three, this  Biltmore Forest School might have  been consen;cd.""  In the soul searchi ng which ac­companied  the decision to discon­titnte  his school Schenck asked the  associate editor of Hm·dwood Reconl,  a former student, ""Did I do wrong?  \ Vould it have been more honorable  to die slowly? Could I have con­tinued  to ask the youths to come  to a school which had 110 students  in prospect? vVhich had 110 money  to pay its teachers and to give the  students the best experiences, be­ca  use it lacked any endowments?""  T he reply confirmed the appropri­ateness  of discontinuance: ""1 agTee  with you that the most honorable  course to pursue was to wi thdra·w  with honors whi le the school was  yet a li ve and important fa ctor in  lorestry circle~ of the United States,  ra ther than let it die a slow death  f  of strangulation as a result of slow­ly  decreasing support.""  Like his teacher, the editor felt  that the school was up against a  proposition that was insurmount­able  because ""it was impossible to  combat the glittering and a ttractive  scientific courses offered by the so­called  other forestry schools in this  country, particularly when the  greatest calls seemed to be coming  from the Federal and State forestry  service for so-called scie ntifically  trained men.""  Even in the face of such discour­:~  ging trends Schenck tried to stimu­late  renewed interest in and support  for his school. He sent out broad­sides  to all leading lumbermen, seek­ing  sustenance. He had hoped to  receive some t:~ngihle indications to  prove that his work was still in de­mand:  "" .\find you, I did not seek  to get their mo ney; not at all. l asked  for a word o f encouragement, and  for students to be taught."" But to  h is chagrin, the respome was so weak  that less than 20 students sough t en­rollment  in 1913. He declined to  te:~ch so small a class on two  gro unds: ""First, because 1 cannot  teach without the i mpi ration of a  larger a udience; second, bec:~use I  cannot foot the bill o f "" staff of  teachers on fewer than some for ty  studems.""  He then voiced p u blicly an opi n­ion  which must have been forming,  ever so gradually, for months: ""The  conclusion is evident that such a  ~c hool as I had been plann ing or  as I had been developi ng, is not so  badl) needed by the lumber inter­es  ts of the United States, as I had  been supposi ng to he the case."" Sev­eral  lumbermen tried to reassure  him that his sad ded uction was er­roneous.  One told him, ""I do not  agree with you in your conclusion  that the Biltmore Forestry School is  not needed by the lumber interests  o f this coun try. I believe it is needed  by them and also by the e ntire cou u­Lry.''  Still, no appreciable assurance of  tangible \upport was forth coming.  So, graspiug for au answer as to  why his school was seeming ly no  lo nger needed, Schenck began to  rationa)i;c, sa ying that if his gTadu­ates  had only made notable successes  of their forestry careers th en ""this  Biltmo re Forest School would no t  have become anemic for lack of e n­couragement  and lack of students.""  He must have pained, even app&lt;~llcd,  the majority of his alumni by grum­bling  that not o ne of them had  made any striking ~uccesses; all had  had to start at the bottom every­where;  and none had become a ""live  advertisement"" for the Biltmore For­est  School. Yet, on their behalf he  mourned: ""I am sorry for my boys;  I had meant to lead them to victory;  1 have led them to sorrow, and their  alma mater is about to die.""  Being ""sorry"" did not ea~e the  biting sharpness o f his grumbling,  and adverse reactions began to pour  Ill on him. Even Fcrnow spoke out  in behaH of the Biltmore boys and  m the process got in a good whack  at the ir director. First he r idiculed:  ""The Biltmore bubble is burst! "" 'c  do not intend to convey any in­vidiom  iminuations on the enter­prise  by th is alliteration, but only  to express in the picturesque lan­guage  which the director of the Bilt­more  School would be apt to use  [to describe] the cessation of a pic­turesque  institution. Dr. Schenck has  written himself its picturesque  obituary, and in doi ng so has de­parted  from the usual mode of obitu­aries,  which arc built on the maxim  de mortius nil nisi bene [of the dead,  speak ever charitably!. by givi ng a  slap to its grad uates."" Then he  lambasted Schenck for complaining  about the lack of living advertise­ments  and notable successes among  his boys and for fu ming because  they had ""to sta rt at the hottom  everywhere."" Fernow caustically  commented: ""This last statement is  indeed amusing-. \Vhat did the di­rector  expect? Did he suppose that  they would start at the top? vVc can  name at least a half do;en of his  men who have made good, and a few  ·who a rc flr~t class a nd do not deserve  the slap: · The critic then departed  from his quoted maxim of dr· mor­tius  nil nisi bene by laying the whole  burden of culpability upon Schenck  ra ther than his '&gt;tudents: ""It is our  suspicion that they made good in  spite of the school, which ·was car­r  ied on upon 111 ista ken pedagogic  principles; ... what would have  been an excellent post graduate  course after the theore tical work  had been done was bound to he­come  an impossible pedagogic abor­tion  for undergrad ua tcs.'  Not satisfied with that blow, Fer­now  la id on another, sayi ng, as he  had so often, that ""the hunting  after pracltcality before the theoreti­cal  foundat ion is a fad , which will  usually re,·engc itself by short dura­tion  ... He [Schenck] is right, there  is 'no more need of such a unique  school as Biltmore'; it was, as he now  admits, 'visionary'"".  At the same time many o ther let­ters  were expressing discontent and  unhappiness with the ""no success""  interpretation issued in Schenck's  fa rewell address.  One Biltmorean, serving as asw­ciate  forester for a large Canadian  pulp and paper company, scolded  Schenck: ""You seem to have lost  faith in your boys. You have 110  cause to do so as there are severa l.  whom 1 know personally or by repu­tation,  that have done, and are doing  fine work ei ther for their employers  or as their own employe rs. P lease,  for the love o f ~like, don't g ive them  a hump like tha t. Remember tha t  there are some of us that arc just  as keen to uphold the good name  o f the School as you arc to have us.""  But from a nother of his boys came  a six page letter manifesti ng sorrow  for being among those who had con­tribu  ted to the dosi ng of the Bilt­more  Forest School through his fail­ure  to make a gla ri ng success in for­estry.  He tempered h is ""sorrow"",  however, with a most telling remark:  ""But as far as I Cilll ~ec there a rc  no very noted men in tile profes­sion  from any school."" Ami, turn­ing  some of Schenck's own philoso­phy  to an unexpected usc, he made  a statement which many a fo rester  has repeated ly had reason to apprc­&lt;  ·iate: ""Fore~try i~ too slow a process  to attract a ttc ntion-a n cngi ncer in  other lines builds a bridge or a canal  or a bui ld ing and it is completed in  a few years and can be seen and  used and written about, but your fo r­e~  tc r saves little waste here, plants a  few trees there, cuts a few fire lanes  ano ther place, and gets a bout as  muc:h attention as an old maid's tea  party.

Fonner students  received a double shock-the ""no  more doings"" letter and the doctor's  later statement that the school would  not have closed had his students  achieved more after leaving the  cradle of forestry.  But Dr. Schenck's charisma was  such that his erstwhile students ral­lied  to his support and gave him  comfort.

""When that is successful, I  shall be willing to devote all my  lifetime to you.""  An old comrade and sometime  lecturer at Biltmore Forest School,  Dr. Hermann von Schrenck, was  furiously passionate in his com­ments:  ""On my return here today 1  find your announcement.

""  .\ustin Cary, one of the most high-  1) respected men in the United  States Forest Service, used the pages  of the Fo1·esl Qua1·terly to offer ""An  Appreciation of Dr. Schenck"" in  which he said: ""When Dr. Schenck  gave up his work among us, America  lost its most picturcsq ue figure, also  one of its strongest individual  forces ... . It is hard to write of the  Biltmore School as a thing of the  past. \\'e shall miss Dr. Schenck, and  the country has lost a force that wa~  high ly useful. 1\'obody will grudge  him anything good that he carries  back home. \\'e wish he might find  a way to return to work among us.

Tragica lly, between publica tion of  the ""no more doings"" letter and  Cary's article, the guns of August,  1914, had set off World "" 'ar I and  impelled the editor of the Forest  Quarterly to add a mournful post­script  to the article: "" \Ve regret to  state that it is creditably reported  that Dr. Schenck fell in battle in  France."" Fortunately the report was  in error and it was Schenck's great  good luck to survi\'C two world war~  and to be repea tedly feted through-o  ut the Uni ted States by admirers  who, true to Cary's promise, gave  Schenck the time of his life.  Prior to the publication of the  appreciation article, Cary had shown  his own regard for Schenck by writ­ing  him an eight page letter Sa)ing,  among other things, ""You ca 11 rest  assured that there arc very many  over here besides Biltmore gradu­ates  who will gratefully cheri sh recol­lectiom.

One man in all  U.S. Forestr) Service!!"" His reaction  to Cary's letter was revealed in the  answer sent to it: "" ... I 'll cherish  that letter because it came from that  man among the Ameri can fo resters  for whom J have the highest measure  of esteem.""  One of the few students who pro­posed  a way of continuing the school  was .J. Harold Peterson, class of 19 10,  who in later years played a major  role in kQCping the old Biltmore  spirit bright. Ile had just read in  the loca l newspaper abo ut the dea th  of George ,\', Vanderbilt and the  obituar y stated that ~Irs. Vanderbilt  had fallen heir to the Biltmore Es­tate.  Recalling that she had always  been a good friend of the fo restry  swdents, he declared that "" there  would be nothing finer in the world  for a woman of her present means  to do philanthropically than to turn  over to the Biltmore ForeM School  that which reall y ought to be theirs  by right of precedent and allow  them to go back to Pisgah Forest.""  It was his opinion that i f the right  parties could ta ke the matter to ~I rs.  Vanderbilt "" in the r ight lines it  could be put across.""  For variom reasons, incl ud ing the  outbreak of "" 'orld "" 'ar I, the idea  ne\·e1· matured but two yean later  Mrs. Vanderbilt d id sell the Pigsgah  Forest to the U ni ted States govern­ment  and thereby faci litated a later  restorat ion of Schenck's summer  campus in the Pink Beds section of  Pisgah. And Peterson had a hand in  that restoration, hall a centur) la ter!  Last Rites  ~ l canwhi lc, out in ~ r a rshfie ld,  Oregon, the )OLmg men most im­med  iately aflected by Schenck's fare­well-  the class of 19 13-took on the  task of conducting ""last rites"" and  d isposing of personal effects. Nor  was their sc hoolmaster forgotte n: his  last class pooled thei1 mone) and  provided him a chain and locket  with the Biltmore Forest School em­blem  on it. This act deeply touched  their mentor whose thank you note  said , "" How reall) sweet, lovel),  touchingly affectionate was it."" In  rea lity, he had expected, or so he  ~a id, ""c ur se~ rather than blessings  from those boys"" beca use of hi ~ leav­ing  them in the lurch.  And, not satisfied with a mere  memento ol locket and chain, the  last class held a meeting and drew  up a formal four page eulogy, com­bining  mourn ful regrets about the  passing o f their alma mater with  high pra ise for thei1 maste1. ,\ s  survivors and heirs they expressed  appreciation for the many benefits  received from attendi ng their be­loved  Biltmore Forest School and for  the t rai ning it had provided them.  Rut primarily they pa id homage to  Doctor Schenck for ""his untiring  years of labor, for the example he  has set us and for his unselfish devo­t  ion to the School."" They acknowl­edged  that he had left each of them  a legacy of training and opportunity  and proclaimed their obligation to  make the most of their training and  to bring honor to Schenck and the  school. Eeri ly prophetic was their  1·emark about the resurrection of  Biltmore Forest School:  The clergy when speaking at  the side of a dem· departed de­elaTes  that there is no death but  that our beloved me1·ely sleeps  fm· a time lo 1·ise again to a new  and better life, and we, who  now mou1·n the death of o111·  alma mater, Tefuse to admit that  she is dead. rve must bow lo  the will of Providence in pa1·t,  however, and conside1· that the  School me1-ely sleeps for a lime  lo Tise again loa new and better  life.  Their prophecy came to pass in  a unique fulfillment. \Vith the death  of George \V. Vanderbilt the forests  which had served as their working  fields passed into the custody of  ~Irs. Vanderbilt who, in 19 14, sold  80,000 acres of her holdings to the  United States Forest Service. The  land was acquired under power of  the 1911 Weeks Law authorizing  purchase of forest lands for water­shed  protection; and the new acqui­sition  \\·as incorporated into the re­cently  established Pisgah National  Forest. In the ensu ing years many  conser\'ation oriented people kept a  watchful e)e over these former work­ing  fields of Pinchot and Schenck.  ,\nd from time to time meaningful  tribute \\·as paid to them in \'arious  ways; but it was a heritage minded  Secretary of Agriculture who brought  ''rebirth"" to the Biltmore Forest  School. \\'bile involved in a cere­mony  celebra ting the fiftieth anni­,  ·ersary of the \\'eeks Law, United  States Secretary of Agriculture Or­ville  Freeman was given a tour of  the Pisgah 1ationa l Forest, includ­ing  the Pink Beds. He was so im­pressed  with the historical role these  working grounds had played in the  national conser\'ation mo\'ement  that he initi ate(! the establishment  of a suitable commemorative, the  Cradle of Forestry in America. As a  result, today in the Pink Beds there  is coming into fruition the fulfill-  Cradle of Forestry  mcnt of the Class of 191 3's prophecy.  The Cradle of Forestry in Amer­ica,  now in stage two of a proposed  four phase development, is ""a ca­thedral  to forestry,"" using the most  advanced interpretive techniques  to tell the story of forestry in Amer­ica.  Every significant aspect of the  American forest and its historic  multiple uses will be interpreted,  using indoor and outdoor dioramas,  exhibits, reconstructed buildings,  nature trails, recreation areas, etc.  The project has won the support of  The American Forestry Association,  which is jointly sponsoring it with  the United States Forest Service.  Thus, to the delight of the surviving  Biltmore Forest School alumni, their  school in the Pink Beds has been  reconstructed and a vital part of any  visit to the Cradle of Forestry in  America involves, first, seeing the  exceptionally well done ""Cradle of  Forestry"" movie, featuring the pio­neering  forestry eiiorts of Pinchot  and Schenck; second, taking the  ""Campus Tour"" and thereby reli\'ing  the glorious clays of the Biltmore  Forest School, pioneer in forestry  education in America.  The class prophecy, therefore, is  111 process of fulfillment.  Successful ""Failures''  But was Schenck r ight about his  boys being ""failures?"" One ""fa ilure""  ser\'ing as forester in Michigan  urged Dr. Schenck neither to be dis­couraged  about his place in Ameri­can  forestry nor the ultimate success  of hi~ students. ""You should not feel  discouraged over anything ... Of  course the fellows as a whole are not  at the head of forestry affa irs in this  country but you take them in com­parison  with any other forestry  school in the country and you will  find that the real Biltmore graduates  never suffer by comparison. Give  them time and they wi ll prove all  that you have preached!"" He also  urged Schenck to remember that the  sensational rise, in one year from  office boy to head of the firm, was a  fictional occurrence; hence, the wise  thing to do was to ""Give them time  and let them pro\'e you were right.""  Later study has supported this  contention and revealed that the  Director was, indeed, much too pes­simistic  about the potential of his  graduates. Out of the more than  365 men who attended the school,  about 300 completed the required  courses. More than half went directly  into forestry work. One, Overton  Price, became Associate Forester of  the United States under Pinchot.  At least four became district or re­gional  foresters. Twenty or more  sen·ed as forest supervisors or dep­uties.  Some dozen earned fine repu­tations  as state foresters. A similar  number served with distinction as  valuation engi neers for the Internal  Revenue Service. Others served as  forestry consu ltants to British India,  Canada, Puerto Rico, The Philip­pines,  Sumatra, etc. And in private  forestry the Biltmore training and  spirit helped to change the old poli­cies  of ""cut and git out"" to wiser  ones of scientific management, better  fire protection, more efficient com­batting  of forest diseases, and better  marketing procedures. \ Vood preser­vation  became the speciality of some,  as did tree surgery. To mention a  few by name, Inman F. (""Cap"")  Eldridge organited and directed the  Forest Sur\'ey of the South and has  been called ""the man who knows  most about the forests of the South.""  Co'ert DuBois ser\'ed as regional for­ester  in California and also as a  consul for the United States. Verne  Rhoades became the first forest super­visor  for Pisgah r\ational Forest.  And almost sixty years later some of  Schenck's ""boys"" are still "" living  advertisements"" for the Biltmore  Forest School, serving as chairman  of the board of well established and  highly respected companies.  Because his students succeeded in  a wide variety of careers, including  mmmg, exporting, and farming,  Schenck on one occasion sa id he felt  like a hen that had hatched ducks.  lllustrative of this ""brood"" is Lor­raine  F. Jones, .Jr., '0 1, who is one  of the leading manufacturer's brok­ers  in St. Louis, .Missouri. And, as  if doing penance for his ""no success""  remark, Schenck in the 1950's com­piled  and edited all available biog­raphies  of his students and published  them with a typically flamboyant  title, The Biltmore Immortals. •",,,,2016-01-21,2016-01-21,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/718,718,260.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/260.pdf,forestryresearch718

It was manufactured by the Climax Manufacturing  Company of Correy, Pennsylvania. This company, produced one of the three  major, geared steam locomotive classes used in the United States and Canada.  Although Climax stopped manufacturing its geared locomotives in 1928, the  finished products continued to perform in forests and on mountain sides,  11Under the most difficult conditions,~~ through the early 1950's.  Champion Fibre Company's Climax #3 first operated on the company's narrow  gauge logging railroads in Swain County, North Carolina, near the present day  town of Smokemont. It remained in this part of the Smoky Mountains for four­teen  years. By 1930 most of the Champion forest land had been worked out in  the Smokemont area and #3 was moved south to the Graham County, North Carolina  forests. Based near Robbinsville, the locomotive worked here until 1943.  In 1936, Champion Fibre Company transferred the title of the Climax to its  corporate successor, Champion Paper & Fibre Company. Sometime around 1943  the new company transferred the locomotive to its Fires Creek operation in  Clay County, North Carolina. The Climax worked on and off in this logging  region until 1948, when it was sold to the Ely-Thomas Lumber Company of  West Virginia. The locomotive was operated on that company's narrow gauge  track, out of a logging camp known as Jetsville, West Virginia until the  mid-1950's. Ely-Thomas Lumber Company changed the l ocomotive's number from  ~· -  3 to 7. This is probably where the original number plate on the smokebox  door was lost.  In 1955, Ely-Thomas Lumber Company sold the retired Climax to Harold F. Allen  of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Mr. Allen, along with a partner named Casey Samborsky,  moved the locomotive from West Virginia and stored it at Glacier Way. The  gentlemen evidently intended to restore the locomotive to running condition and  operate it, along with several other steam locomotives they had. The partners  ran into financial difficulties and never di~ complete their restoration p1ans.  The Forest Service purchased the Climax in Michigan, and returned it to North  Carolina and the Cradle of Forestry. Officials with the Forest Service  determined that it would be desirable to restore the locomotive for display  purposes at the Cradle of Forestry.",,,,2016-01-21,2016-01-21,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/719,719,261.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/261.pdf,forestryresearch719

It is about six miles from the canadian  border.  The town of Trail in british Golumbia is about six miles north of  the border and less than a mile east of r~ o rthport. 'l'he two towns are,  therefore, 12-13 !niles apart. ·.rrail is also on the Golumbia river and  the smelter plant is situated at Trail and on the west flank of the river .  fD l Since the Columbi a river swings a mile or so east from Trail to the border  thence southv1est to Northport , the two towns by way of the river are some  fifteen miles apart. l am mentioning this because the river valley is the  path of the fumes from 'i'rail to Northport and vicinity.  The smelter at Trail lies in a deep gor ge cut out by the Columbia  river. ~'he region is decidedly rugged and is flanked on either side by  mountains sufficiently high to preclude a diffusion of smoke fumes to the east  or west except in case of gorges formed by streams tributar; to the Columbia .  The ;Jorthport area is composed of this valley of the Golumbia proper and  parts of the tributary creek gor ges, and, of course, this whole includes the  slopes and benches of the mountain sides of the valley and its tributaries. ;.:-  The whole region was once timbered but is now largely logged off. 'Jherewas  also at one time considerable mining but mining operations have now largely  ceased.  On the slopes and benches and even hanging high up on some of the mountain  sides small farms have been developed . Yany of these have , ow been abandoned,  the most of them before 1926. the time when fume damage was first noticed.  - 2-  The area under cultivation is only a small percentage of the total and about  half of this area has now been abandoned .  'l'he soils are coarse, low in organic matter, and the subsoil is gravelly  and sandy, with low water holding capacity and no fertility. Competent  irrigation engineers estimate that it would require a cv~iee ef ~ 30 0 an  acre to put even the best of this land under irrigation and successful  farming in the region is out of the question without irrigation . 1t may be  added that few of the farmers are irrigating at present, and even those  that have water do not have it in sufficient abundance . 1t is largely a  dry farming proposition under conditions not any too favorable to agriculture  , at....l:1~ . 'lhese farms are occupied by good people but not good farmers for  the most part . These conditions, coupled with the general slump that farming  in general has undergone the last several years, together with the fact that  the last two seasons have been abnormally dry, have combined to bring about  conditions which have made farming here a very risky business . In fact the  greater part of these lands might be called marginal lands for agricultural  purposes, and some of them submarginal. /hen the farms were first brought  under cultivation, fairly good crops were grown during seasons of good rain-­fall,  but now the soils have been cropped out and all these conditions have  put the owners in a frame of mind to want to sell and get out of the country.  The marketing center of the region is Northport. 'l'his was once a thriving  little cit;r of 1800 people according to the census of 1920, but the population  has now dwindled to not over 600.  The first smelter was established here in 1896 and employed from four to  seven hundred men . A le.rge part of the ores were brourrht -rom the .Kossland  region just across the border in uritish ~ olumbia. I t is said that at times  as many as four hundred six-horse teams were employed in hauling these ores  from riossland to Northport. A couple of years after 1396 a railroad spur was  -3-  built from r:orthport to H.ossland at which time teaming stopped . 'l'his first  smelter company operated till about 1909 and the smelter stood idle from  1915 when it was taken over by the Day interests and ran until 1920 when it  was closed down and dismanteled . Soon after the passing of this smelter the  railroad from North_:&gt;ort to rlossland was abandoned and the road bed is now  used as a highway . '1'he railroad bri:ige at Northport is also a part of this  highway. It may be said that Northport is an excellent site fo r a smelter .  There are ample grounds , plenty of water, cheap electrical power, and a  government right to dump slag in granulated form in the river .  It should be stated here that considerable damage to vegetation,  including timber, was inflicted by the smelters before they were abandoned  and considerable litigation followed as a result of t his damage .  The l~orthport region now has probably one-third of the population it  had at its peak . ':'he passing of the Northport smelter, the ceassati on  of active mining operations, a waning logging and sawmill industry, and the  abandonment of farms have been the chief causes of the loss of population  at Northport and the slump it has under gone as a trading center.  Of a total area of 33,128 acres in fa rms around North port, 7 , 560 acres  or about 23/o had been abandoned up to and including the year of 1928. 'J.'he  most of this area had been abandoned before 1926. 1be nwnber of farms  abandoned within the stricken area since 1926 and t he areas outside is about  the same, thus showing that the smelter fumes have not been the great factor  in driving the farmers off .  Da'~Jage to field crops was first noticed in 1926 following the raising  of the smoke stacks at the smelter by 200 feet, giving t hem a total height  now of over 400 feet . Doubtless there had been some damage in northern  Stevens county immediately south of the border before the stacks were raised,  but such damage had ot been noticed . lt may be said that before this  farm lands on the Canadian side around the smelter up and down the Columbia  river had been purchased by the com~any or the company had bought easements .  However, the company can not purchase the property damaged in .ashington,  neither can it settle for the damage by the purchase of easements as the  iashington laws forbid a foreign corporation from owning property within  the state . This fact has been a big factor in complica:ting the matter of  making settlements for damage in the state of .• ashington.  }1_,'v eryone admits damage , and the Trail Sme 1 ter t.:ompany settled for damages  in as far as the farmers would accept them for the years of 1926 and 1927 ,  and in most cases making settlement upon the farmer's own estimate of his  damage .  In the early part of 1928 the case was referred to the international  Joint t;ommission under the 1aterways 'l'reaty between the _,nited ;)tates and  Great Britain in 1909 . ITo crop damages have been settled since that date .  0oon after the case was referred to the International Joint Gommis sion  in the early part of 1928, both the American and ~anadian governments sent  experts into the region to study the whole situation. Ihe International  Joint Gommission held a hearing at tiorthport in October, 1928, at which  time a large number of claims were presented, but the studies by the experts  of the two governments have not gone far enough to make it possible to  make any settlements •  . e were sent into the region to assess crop damage for 1928 and 1929  and for 1926 and 1927 where such damage had not been paid . ,e were to  include damage for timber, but it was found impossible. to get at this phase  of the question in as much as the forest pathologists had not been able to  det ermine the zone of timber damage, neither had a cruise been made to show  how much timber had been killed within that zone . ~e , therefore , confined  our work entirely to making an award for crops damaged for the four years as  indicated .  e did not presume ourselves to say whether damage had been done and  -5-  '.?here it had been done. On the contrary we too k the word of the government  plant pathologists for this . About the middle of J""uly the i nternational  Joint Commission appointed a tJanadian pathologist and an American agronomist  and economist to determine crop damage for 1929 . 1~ey worked faithfully and  hard for two solid months, but the case was so complicated that they had  very little as a matter of fact to base actual damage upon.  l'he scientists tell us that there must be a conjunction of four  definite conditions to crop .injury to plant tissues by sulphur dioxide.  1. Sunlight  2. A temperature of 40 degrees or over  3 . A re~l ative humidity of 60 or over  4. Gontinued presence of sulphur dioxide  above the minimum density f or over  two hours.  'l'he minimum density for causing damage to plants is commonly taken to  be one part of sulphur dibxide to one million ports of air .  During the summer of 1929 there was plenty of sunlight and the  temperature was plenty high, running as high as 105 July 31.  1'he relative humidity, usually 60 - 70 a t 5 A. '1. would drop to from  20 - 25 by noon, and usually still lower by 5 P.M. , being as low as 6 at  5 P.M. on July 31 . 1he low relative humidity to ether wit h the fact that  there were no rains to speak of through the summer, create conditions unfavor able  to crop damage . These conditions, however, were very conducive to damage  by drought, and drought damage was generally not only in the Northport area  but in all the country around. However , the farmers insisted that drought  damage was real smoke damage . In fact , any kind of damage that their crops  suffered was generally attributed to sm ok e ~  Accurate estimates made of the concentration of S02 in the air at  different parts of the ay t hrough the regi on showed that there were  very few localities and even then only very few occasi ons when the S02 con-centration  was as great as one part to one million, and exceedingly few  times when the concentration exceeded this pr oportion. voncentratiorJ.$ however,  in measurable quantit~e s were found over a wide area in some cases down the  -6-  river as far as 40 miles from Trail, but the pathologists did not find  but few markings on vegetation down th3t far, and no economic damage to  crops for more than a few miles south of Northport.  Since the pathologists could not give us any basis for estimating  crop damage for 1929, and since the International Joint ~oromission was  wanting to pay the farmers damage in order to carry them over till final  settlement could be made, we were put hard to it for a basis for making  damage awards.  Our studies have satisfied us that the damages paid by the '!'rail ..;melter  people for the seasons of 126 and '27 had been fair and liberal, and since  in most cases they were the estimates of the farmers themselves, we finally  bit upon the plan of taking the settlements already made as a starting point  and offered the farmers who had already settled for 1926 and 1927 the same  amounts for 1928 and 1929, since ~8 and'29 as a pair of years seemed  comparable to '26 and '27 as a pair of years as far as damage .was concerned •  . 1ith this as a starting point, we worked out a proportionate damage for  a few farmers who were not included for the settlements made for 1926 and  1027, finally recommending awards for fifty-four different farmers , the  awards totalling $7415 . If it is kept in mind that this sum does ~ ot  inc ude any damage to timber nor any damage to the farms as farms, the  figure we set has a very different meaning from that which was given out  by press dispatches recently when our figure of $7415 was compared to the  total of the claims which is four and one-half millions of dollars.",,,,2016-02-02,2016-02-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/760,760,761.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/761.pdf,forestryresearch760

Long  In the Taat rnajori t7 of t.reea the water careyi.ng system is limited  to the living bnrk and n~pwood, however, there are exceptions to this ~n­eral  rnle.  In e ~exico there ere two specieu ot trees which are able to  tra.neport "" ter through both sa.p:;ood o.nd heart·1ood during their entire life.  !rhe Valley Cott.omrood (PopUlue ntelezeni) is one and the lluesie.n .rulberry  (Morna ~ t,rtariga) is the other. This nb1lit7 to conduct water through  the heerhood is apparent whenever c. large living 11mb h cut off. 'rhe  severed end of the ntu.b often ·continueo to ""leek"" for years; water runa out  of the center of the exposed heart~ood and. down th~ trunk of the tree. In  the c~se of the Valloy cottonwood th1a oxudivg wat.er carries an aporeciable  quantity of alkali which i:o left as · white enci'U.fJtn.tion on the bark of the  tree as the water o1'a.porat~e. This rr:ovement of the •nter through old wounds  del8,)'s for years the complete coverlng of. the ecars tritb wound callus. while  the presence of the alk:a11 keeps the lower p.::trt of the scar over 'll'hieb the  water nowa from forminc n ealluo, hence such , oum& on thie cot tonYrood takll  Jtara to heal. In fo.ot they rill not complotel,y close up c.nd unite as long  as the old wound continues to ""lenk~.

This delq allo•• the freSh scar Ume to dey out soma so that the tar wUl  penetrate deeper into the wound.

INTRODUCTION  Honduras, the largest of the Central American republics, has  more than 15,000 square miles of conifers, as well as extensive  stands of tropical hardwoods. Forest products constitute the  primary wealth for that portion of the country which has land  too mountainous and soil too shallow for modern intensive agri-culture.  Already, forest products account for one-tenth of the  foreign trade, surpassed only by bananas and coffee.  A. Economic Importance of Pine to Honduras  Ocote pine (Pinus oocarpa} constitutes the primary species  and has excellent potential for industrialization. It is estimated  that under full stocking, the pine forests as a whole are capable  of a growth rate of about 6m3/ha(l} per year on a regular (medium}  site. On good sites, however, growth rates of 8.5 to llm3/ha( 2 )  per year can be expected. These are considered to be conservative  (l)l020 bd. ft./acre  (2 )1445 to 1870 bd. ft./acre  2  estimates since it is expected that good forest management could  increase the growth. On the other hand, if regeneration is not  established and if the damage to the forest from fire, exploitative  or illegal cutting, and pests increases, even the present average  growth yield cannot persist, and the forests themselves could  finally disappear.  It is estimated that it takes about 35 years for a Honduran  pine to reach a height of 75 to 100 feet and a diameter (at breast  height) of at least 14 inches.  Honduras is fortunate in that a great part of the land that  is unfit for agriculture is suitable for the continued production  of timber, so that it has the potential to support an industry  that can provide work and wages for the growing population.  B. Influence of Beetle - Endemic and Epidemic  The pine bark beetle is a natural inhabitant of tropical  pine forests, but under normal conditions the beetles do not  attack healthy trees or, if they do, the trees are strong enough  to withstand the attack. Toward the end of 1962, an increase  in the population of the pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis  Zimmerman) was noticed in the eastern part of the county of  Olaucho. It is not clear what caused the increase in the first  place, nor what turned it from a relatively slowly increasing  infestation into a genuine epidemic in June, 1963. It is suspected  that the almost year~y forest fires had weakened the trees over  the last few decades, and nhat the lack of rain during the usual  rainy season contributed to the vulnerability of the stand.  3  By January, 1964, the epidemic had reached the eastern  boundaries of the counties of Yoro and Francisco Morazan, and  estimates were that more than 3000 square miles were affected.  The area of infestation continued to spread westward, and the  epidemic had long since become so virulent that even healthy  trees could not withstand it. The government moved into action  early in 1964. The government passed a law declaring emergency  status for the most seriously infected regions, and established  a special organization - the Campana para la Defensa del Pino -  to combat the plague. At the request of the Coordinating Committee  of the project, the United Nations Special Fund agreed to make  the project team available to aid the government in fighting the  bark beetle. For several months the Forest Service, together  with technical advisors from the U. S. Agency for International  Development (USAID}, the Expanded Program of Technical Assistance  (EPTA}, and AFTAH, the bilateral Germa~ forestry assistance program  in Honduras, participated in the campaign. The World Food Program  assisted with food aid.  By April of 1964, it had become apparent that the extent and  virulence of the epidemic had gone far beyond any control measures  by any means within the economic or logistical resources of  Honduras.  The epidemic continued to spread and to increase in severity.  Within the central pine region of the country, more than 2000 square  miles of additional pine forest had been affected by September, 1964.  4  It was not until August, 1964, when reconnaissance flights  over most of the country revealed only a few small new outbreaks  in the west (around Lago de Yojon, La Esperauza, and Morcala  Counties) / that it could finally be said that the bark beetle  infestation had lost its epidemic character (Fig. 1).  II . LIFE HISTORY AND HABITS  A. Life Cycle  The development of the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus _  frontalis Zimmerman) varies by season and location. The beetle  completes seven (and a partial eighth) consecutive development  periods each year under favorable forest conditions. During the  warmer months, fewer eggs are deposited, larval veines are often  longer (20 to 60 mm) and less protected from arthropod attackers  &lt;--  and environmental influence on the inner bark &urface.  Brood development is more rapid from mid-February to late  July, when temperatures rarely drop below 70° and often exceed  95°F in the north coast of the country. The delightful climate  of Honduras provides the perfect setting for rapid and continuous  growth of fungus and the propagation of the bark beetle. The  following table shows the mean rainfall (Period 1956-63) and  mean temperature (Period 1960-63) in the central part of  Honduras.  5  Fi uRE 1 . .:J SkeTc~ Map of f-lo n d u r a, S  z~&lt;----  /  Jan.  7  72.6  6  Feb.

Combination of  excessively high phloem moisture and adverse temperature, if  maintained beyond a certain point in the early development of  a brood, is detrimental. The best rearing environment for beetles  in bolts would be at temperatures ranging from 20° to 22° C and  R. H. of 50 to 60 per cent 'r-o-~Q... 19 '7)  B. Attack Behavior  With the growing recognition of the fact that our future  ""/_ .(. A {h_ ~ )__..., 7  timber supplies are to be had, not alone by conserving present  _.....-p t 'I  stands, but by g~owing future crops, it is t~me-te-de~erm~~e  consideration must be given to insects in the application  of silvicultural methods, particularly with the object of  preventing rather than of controlling outbreaks.  Dispersal pattern and host selection of southern pine beetle  populations is an excellent preventive control of the D. frontalis,  I  7  which periodically threatens the forest with severe outbreaks.  Very few of the dispersing beetles land immediately after starting  their initial flight period.  Two phases of colonization follow the initial host selection.  First, a progressively increasing attack narrowly focuses, by  olfactory response, on a tree and to that portion which is initially  affected. Second, mass aggregation occurs on vertical objects  near established sources of attraction, regardless of whether or  not the objects are suitable as host materials. Apparently,  visual orientation supplements olfactory response in aggregating  the population. Differences in the resistance of host trees to  southern pine beetle infestation seem to be limited to warding  off initial attacks.  Emerging populations of ~ frontalis will continue to attack  new hosts near their brood trees. When sources of attractants  are unavailable in the vicinity of the outbreak, the population  disperses and may concentrate elsewhere.  Under field conditions a number of factors may affect loss  of synchrony of emergence and attraction which, in turn, lead to  disp~rsal. Local weather conditions may speed or delay beetle  emergence, flight, or attack; adverse weather may lower the  production of attractants; 6r, conceivably, rain may wash off or  dilute attractive residues adhering to frass or bark. Indirectly,  weather conditions may also influence synchronization by retarding  larval development or affecting the quality of host material. Unsuitable  8  host material may foster a lowered level of pheromone production  or even inferior populations with an increased proportion of  individuals with a lessened ability for response. Under such  circumstances, a spot population appears to collapse and the  spot may be termed inactive.  Interruptions in the synchrony of emergence and attraction  are an essential, perhaps not fully appreciated, part of chemical  control procedures. Chemical control of .infestations during summer  are only possible when the most recently attacked trees are cut  and treated first.  The fact that no further trees become attacked is usually  mistaken as a result of the chemical control, when actually it is  due to removal of the attractive material.  Colonization of P-inu~ spp. by the pine beetle is largely  governed by chemical messengers, originating from both host and  insect. D~droctonus species share a number of insect-generated  volatiles. Trans-verbenol, verbenone, brevicomin, and frontalin  have been isolated from Dendroctonus species.  c. Mating  When a male was placed in the entrance of a gallery made by  a female, it entered the gallery immediately. After reaching the  female, which often was found at the end of the gallery, it  jostled the posterior end of the female many times and then  started to remove the frass made by the female.  9  Both ma les and females were found to mate more than once.  In one observation, one female mated six times in four hours  with different males. In another observation, one male copulated  three times with the same female in a three-hour period. The  copulation lasted an average of only 30 seconds.  When a beetle was introduced into a gallery, it seemed to  differentiate the sexes olfactorily.  The predator Thanasimus dubius follows aggregations of the  southern pine beetle, in response to pheromones released by its  prey. Male and female T. dubius respond rapidly, in large  numbers, and with a balanced sex ratio to frontalin, the major  -component of the population-aggregating principle of its prey.  III. TREE AND STAND SUSCEPTIBILITY  Knowledge of host selection by bark beetles is important  both in the control of these insects and in research on the  resistance of pines to beetle attack.  The incidence of attack per category of trees is about 20  times greater on previously-attacked trees than on those previously  unattacked. , Thus, this beetle is highly attracted by other attacks  and exhibits, somewhat, the ""mass attack"" habit noted for other  Scalytids, particularly Dendroctonus and Ips.  Mass aggregation of populations on new host trees are largely  caused by olfactory responses to attractants created by the  attracting females.  10  The attractant is apparently composed of host defacation  and insect components, which interact in some unknown manner in  orienting the population to new hosts. The only known components  of bark beetle attractants are terpene alcohol.  D. ponderosae, D. frontalis, and D. brevicomis produce  substantial amounts of trans-verbenol as a characteristic material  of the hind gut.  Adult females of Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmerman and D.  ~ -  brevicomis (Lee.), upon contact with new host material of Pinus  .I  spp., strongly attract other members of their species to initially  infested trees. The aggregations that result are largely due to  .z;:/ C• w ·- I .l \A _v-.....  olfactory responses of the bark beetles to attractive principles  ~ / ~  of chemic-al compos-ition.  Females of both species produce the same major volatile  compound, identified as trans- verbenol. Trans-verbenol is known  ( t«l.  to be a product of auto-oxidation of a pinene, b~t its presence  in the hind gut of ~ frontalis and· D. brevicomis females would  suggest that it is being produced by the beetles.  Aggregation of destructive populations of Dendroctonus and ]ips  in pure forests consists of three phases: first, detection and  selection of suitable host trees; second, mass attack and coloni-zation;  and th~rd, a possible mass attack of adjacent trees. Host  finding is believed to be random or guided by host odors. The mass  attack of selected trees is caused by attractants or pheromones  generated by the insects, and which are effective over considerable  11  distances. The attractants are produced by the host-selecting sex,  and released only in contact with fresh host material.  IV. DAMAGE EVALUATION  The bark beetle infestation running rampant in Honduras  has vividly called attention to the tremendous wealth represented  in pine forests and the pressing need for roads, fire control,  reliable information, maps, better communications, trained personnel,  and a forest management system.  The Honduran government is interested in forestry for the  first time since 1954. Our forests are in urgent need of immediate  recognition and management. ~ forest management program will not  come easy. This program will need support by enforcement of forest  management regulations, that may first have to be enacted into  1~.  Surveys subsequent to the epidemic showed that the average  loss of pine volume to the bark beetle had been 20 per cent,  although losses differed widely from stand to stand and varied  somewhat from one region to another. At 1964 prices,  pine lumber brought an average of U.S. $36.00 per 300  on the export market. If all the volume of pine lost in the epidemic  had been cut and sawed into lumber, the exportable portion would  have brought Honduras more than U.S. $300 million. This is nearly  75 per cent of the gross national product for the entire country  in 1964. In addition, further revenue would have been received for  domestic sales. This was indeed a great loss.  12  There are 111 sawmills, which produce approximately 575,000  cubic meters of 20,309,000 cubic feet of lumber annually. It  would take the present mills of Honduras about five years to saw  the timber that is dead.  V. CONTROL  5  It is well known that Dendroctonus cause an annual drain  on timber in Honduras, and that periodically they increase to  an epidemic status which results in extremely heavy losses. It  is believed that the damage done by bark beetles far exceeds  any beneficial effect which they may exert on the forests of the  country. So, it is time to determine the silvicultural, chemical,  and biological control.  A. Silvicultural  The first symptoms of bark beetle attacks are usually the  appearance of pitch tubes, the small globs of gum that accumulate  around the entrance hole. In two to three weeks after attacks,  the needles begin to droop and turn yellow. Later, they become  red as the trees die. By the time the needles turn red, the beetle  broods will usually have left the tree.  The fact that bark beetles require weakened trees in which to  breed provides a means of preventing serious outbreaks. Losses are  minimized, even in drought periods, in well-managed timber stands.  13  Pine stands should be thinned at frequent intervals to reduce  the competition between trees. Timber that has reached maturity  and worked-out turpentine trees should be removed. Competition  from hardwood and brush should be kept to a minimum. These  practices eliminate the breeding places of the beetles and increase  the amount of water available to the remaining trees.  In logging operations, precautions should be taken to prevent  the build-up of large bark beetle populations. Tops should be  lopped and left in the sun to dry out. The larger tops left after  sawtimber cutting should be utilized promptly for pulpwood. During  severe drought periods, material larger than three inches in diameter  that is to be left in the woods should be sprayed with one-fourth  per cent gamma isomer of BHC (benzene hexachloride).  Every effort should be made to prevent injuries to the trunk  and roots. Pruning and cutting should be done in rainy seasons.  Under extreme endemic conditions, the emerging beetle population  disperses and survives in the absence of specific breeding material  in trees damaged by lightning or logging or infested by other  insects. Injured trees may represent the only suitable material  for successful attack. As soon as a host has been invaded, a  pheromone is released by the female beetle, insuring the attraction  of a male.  1 ( j ~ ~ . I.J / ' r,( I  fl/1( f !J '1 ~  14  B. Chemical  Bark beetle infestations can be controlled if they are found  early. Serious losses may result if control measures are delayed.  Infested trees should be sprayed with a solution of BHC containing  one per cent of the gamma isomer. On large, thick-barked trees  it may be necessary to scrape the heavy, loose bark plates off the  base of the tree to allow better penetration of the insecticide.  Benzene hexachloride is a chemical compound made up of five  closely related chemicals called isomers. Of these five isomers,  only the gamma isomer (lindane) is important for killing insects.  Therefore, the insecticidal value of BHC solutions are dependent  upon the content of the gamma isomer.  BHC may be purchased as technical grade, wettable powder,  oil concentrate, or emulsifiable concentrate. The concentrates  are easier to use and are commonly sold containing 12-~ per cent  of gamma or one pound of gamma per gallon. The oil concentrate  diluted with oil is recommended for woods use and the emulsifiable  diluted with water for shade trees.  A spray of one per cent gamma benzene hexachloride in water  equals the standard 0.5 per cent oil solution as a summer control  for the southern pine beetle. Substitution of water for diesel  oil reduces the cost of components by about five cents per gallon  and, in addition, permits substantial savings in transportation,  since water is generally available in the field. The risks of fire  and dermatitis are also eliminated.  15  Spray is applied over the entire bark surface to the point  of runoff. Fast-acting herbicides containing cacodylic acid  (dimethylarsenic acid) significantly reduce broods of Dendroctonus  adjunctus (Hopkins), D. obesus (Mannerheim), D. ponderosae  .fo'  (Hopkins), and D. pseudotsugaV (Hopkins) in naturally infested  )  trees. The chemical is injected directly into the sap stream  near ground level. Application is made soon after the attack,  before most of the eggs have hatched.  Control of bark beetles by injection of herbicides looks  promising. It appears that this method is well-suited for use  on large-scale control operations. Advantages: (1) ease of  application, (2) low cost of treatment, (3) safe for both applicator  and environment, and (4) lower hazard to non-target insects.  c. Biological  Forty-two families and 83 species of insects were found  associated with the southern pine beetle. Eight known hymenopterous  parasites and seven known predators of southern pine beetle were  identified. A torymid, Roptrocerus eccoptogastri, was the most  prevalent of the wasps found parasitizing the southern pine  beetle. The life history of R. eccoptogastri is apparently more  closely synchronized with that of the southern pine beetle than  any of the other parasitic wasps. Emergence of this insect  occurred simultaneously with emergence of the southern pine beetle  brood adults. Dendrosoter sulcatus and Heydenia unica were the  next most abundant of the parasitic wasps. Cecidostiba dendroctoni,  16  a known parasite of the southern pine beetle, was recorded  relatively abundant.  Of the Diptera, Medetera maura, a dolichopodid, was recovered  ~  from infested trees. Thanasimus dubius (Coleoptera:Clerid9)1,  Scoloposcelis mississippenis (Homoptera:Anthocoridae), and  Temnochila virescens (Coleoptera:Ostomidae) were among the most  prevalent predators collected. Of the remaining associated  insects, some were predators, hyperparasites, or parasites of other  insects, and some were scavengers or competitors for phloem food  supply. The combination of all species of predators, parasites,  and competitors of southern pine beetle probably had an effect  in lessening the intensity or causing the decline of its outbreaks.  A clerid beetle, Thanasimus dubius, is highly predaceous  on the southern pine beetle and on ~ calligraphus Germar.  A T. dubius adult, during a life span of 5 to 10 weeks, can  destroy at least 75 southern pine beetles. As the southern  pine beetles and Ips beetles land on the bark, the adult of T.  dubius moves about rapidly catching and feeding upon them, and  mating and laying eggs. Females deposited from ze -G to 44 eggs  /•p; p-tJ~  daily (average 2.4). Eggs were laid singly or in clusters of  J--/ 7  t rer to 1 0 . The incubation period ranged from seven to 14 days.  T. dubius larvae fed on all stages of the host beneath the  bark, but mainly on the larvae and pupae of the southern pine  beetle.  T..:.. dubius may be capable of reducing epidemic populations  of the southern pine beetle to tolerable levels.  17  VI. INFLUENCE OF DENDROCTOftLUS FRONTALIS ON ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTION  The republic of Honduras is presently at the stage of  management where there are four important problems that need to  be solved . These problems are: road net and protection, water-shed,  timber productivity, and regulation.  A. Road Net  It is reasonable to assume that there will not be good  forest management and a healthy lumber industry until there are  good arterial highways running directly from timber areas to  seaports. High transportation costs are now the cause of about  20 per cent of each tree being left in the woods.  a/  Honduras is roughly the size of Georgia, which h~d over  95,000 miles of rural roads. This is in direct contrast to the  less than 2,000 miles of comparable roads in Honduras. The  existing poor roads and the resulting high transportation costs  are the greatest contributing factors to the poor logging practices  now used. Lack of roads is causing the timber stands adjacent to  roads to be overcut. No change can be expected in these practices  until good roads are available. A transportation system suitably  located, adequately constructed, and properly maintained is  essential to protect our forest from injurious insects and forest  fires.  Fire control will be difficult to sell, since it will mean  changing a well-established way of life. Repeated burning is a  18  way of life in Honduras. Practically the entire pine forested  area is burned over once every three to five years. This h a s  resulted in a thin, even-aged stand of pine.  Indiscriminate burning is done to kill insects, clear land  in a shifting agricultural economy, and to provide grass for  cattle. The bark beetle epidemic would be due to an over-aged  stand of timber continually weakened by fire.  The Forest Service has provided fire control for the last  ten years. Elsewhere, fire sweeps from 20 to 50 per cent of the  forest area every year, and regeneration is destroyed before it  can reach survival size.  If the rural population can see the forest as a source of  wealth and a source of future jobs, they will better understand  the need to conserve it, to control fires, and to control  illegal cuttings. Making forest information available to people  would help in the task of gaining their cooperation to improve  the productivity of the forest as a whole .  B. Watershed  Forest have other values besides their importance as a source  of primary wealth. In many areas where they have been destroyed,  soil has been washed away, floods have become more frequent  in the rainy season, and droughts have become more severe in  the summer. In the parts of Honduras where the soil is very  shallow, the loss of the forest could result in the loss of the  soil itself, leaving only the barren underlying rock. The potential  for soil erosion and sediment damage to water quality increases in  rugged mountainous terrain.  19  All land uses are potential precursors of floods, soil  erosion, and sediment production. Abusive use or insect damage,  if allowed to proceed sufficiently far, result in these conditions.  These damage agents must be guarded against, because natural  recovery of hydrologic characteristics and soil stability by  damaged watersheds frequently proceeds so slowly. Corrective  action must be taken to hasten recovery to a level of satisfacto~y  watershed conditions. A significant part of watershed management  in Honduras should be devoted to the development and application  of appropriate watershed rehabilitation treatments and restoring  protective watershed conditions.  c. Timber 'Productivity  Honduras has an estimated 79 million cubic meters of timber  concentrated on an area of about 2 million hectares. (3 ) With  good forest management the pine lands are capable of growing  18 million cubic meters (4 ) of roundwood annually. Yet, due to  repeated burning, insects, shifting agriculture, etc. the annual  growth is about one third of capability.  Good forest management practices are completely lacking and  proper silviculture practices are ignored. The poor logging  practices contribute to an unbelievable waste of timber.  Present milling practices are on the average quite bad.  The logs, 16 feet in length, have been hand chopped square.  (3 )2,790,280,000 cubic feet on 4,942,000 acres.  (4 )635,760,000 cubic feet.  Lumber is hand-dipped to kill insects and prevent blue  stain.  20  It now appears that with sound forest management, the  danger to the Honduran pine resource should be no greater than  the risk that is faced anywhere in the world where large areas  have pure stands of individual species.  Forest management that increases the vigor of a forest  reduces its vulnerability to attack. More important, however,  with an existing staff of trained forest personnel it is possible  to find and quarantine any small outbreak that might form the  nucleus of a new epidemic.  The fores~of Honduras are capable of producing a high  yield of good quality wood. However, they cannot reach their  potential yield unless forest management planning and regulation  of industrial forests are applied and are protected from damage  agents.  D. Forest Regulation Plan of Aqua Fria  The Forestry ~roject in Aqua Fria will stimulate economic  growth and provide effective development of 20,000 acres of pine  forest. This project will benefit 200 rural families who now  live in a minimum subsistance economy, with the typical family  income averaging less than $150.00 a year. Income will increase  according to the amount of lumber processed and sold by the  cooperative.  The inventory in Aqua Fria region indicated that we should  cut about seven million board feet of timber annually. This amount  21  of timber will provide a base for forest industry development  and management of these previously unmanaged stands (Fig. 2).  Three main sections make up the project area with each  main section divided into three subsections for a total of nine  subsections (Fig. 3). The high quality saw logs mature in  about 60 years; therefore, a 6-2/3 years cutting cycle for each  subsection might yield the greatest returns from rapid growing  Honduran pine. This implies a selective cutting of the entire  area every 60 years.  The stand structure indicates no serious reproduction  problem. To assist regeneration on cut-over subsections, we  will build three-strand barbed wire fences around each subsection  following the cut. Free grazing rights enjoyed by cattle owners  make a fence necessary.  We must employ all the necessary methods as-m~ch-~ ~eflt  control the southern pine beetle and the forest fires  which occur and which, given the traditional customs of the country,  could constitute a serious danger for the quantity and quality of  r the timber. The danger of man-caused fires increases as more  .people work in the forest. This necessitates building three forest  fire lookout towers for rapid detection and reporting of potentia±  forest fires.  Rational management of .this region will not allow private  ownership of forest lands. Instead, the family units of the  region ·will organize into a cooperative to grow and harvest the  timber and to manage the sawmill. A government official will  appoint the general manager of the cooperative who has two  F.- o v ""t- e  J ~ . Resiov,.  z~&lt;:----  F,· 3 u re 3.

The cooperative will establish an educational service to  inform prospective members about the forest as a source of  income and jobs. Members must understand the need to conserve  'II ' }  the forest by controlling fire and preventing the southern pine  beetle.  The Governmental Division of Roads and Highways will construct  35 mile$?on~ roads, needed in the execution of the project.  These roads will facilitate the transportation of wood and also  will serve as a means of access for forest protection and for  public use.  To efficiently utilize the forest products, we will construct  a sawmill in the locality of Aqua Fria, the most populous of the  hamlets within easy reach of the timber. The Technical Depart-ment  of the National Agrarian Institute will promote short  courses to provide workers with training ori the job. This  sawmill will produce about 18,000 board feet of sawn lumber daily  and will employ about 100 workers.  Until now, a large part of the high-quality wood exported  to the European market has received a lower price than that  paid by the North American market. The southwestern United  States may become a larger market in the future. In this area  there exists active interest in high grade Honduran pine. Markets  for pulpwood will develop by 1972.  The National Agrarian Institute will keep a record of all  production, will administer payment of outstanding debts, and  25  reinvestments into the cooperative. The Institute will also  administer distribution of the profits to the local members during  the first three years. The average annual family income of  those living there will increase to approximately $575.00.  Since this represents a unique project in all Latin American  countries, the Institute will closely observe all aspects. We  will publish the necessary information of this Forest Development  Project in a special momograph. The results would not be confined  to our area, but would also contribute valuable knowledge toward  management of the forest to the neighboring countries.  26  VI. LITERATURE CITED  1. Bennett, W.

To MAKE EFFECTIVE PEST MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, managers need to know the  extent of pest damage. Recently developed simulation models (Stage 1973, Mitch-ell  1975) being used to assist forest management planning provides managers an  opportunity to explore alternatives by projecting the outcomes of different stand  treatment and pest management strategies.  Stand projections not accounting for losses attributable to various damaging  agents will forecast stand conditions considerably different from reality.

A model was parameterized and used to simulate juvenile stand  growth and development under varied management, environmental, and biolog-ical  conditions, and to quantify the effects of tussock moth defoliation on juvenile  stand growth and development.  STATE OF KNOWLEDGE  Most studiesa ddressingth e impact of insect defoliationo n tree growth concen-trate  on stand growth losses associated with mature trees. This substantial direct  influence on tree growth and mortality is well documented (Baskerville 1960,  Batzer 1973, Kulman 1971, Pollard 1972, Wickman 1963). However, insect de-foliators  may also significantly influence the dynamics of stand development, and  thereby indirectly affect tree growth and mortality as well. Smith (1977) studied  several tussock moth defoliated mature stands and found that even light to mod-erate  defoliation levels affected the dynamics of stand development by altering  the competitive relationships among host and nonhost trees. Smith also suggested  that differences in postdefoliation recovery rates between host species also  caused long-term alterations in stand structure and composition.  Mattson and Addy (1975) and Stoszek and others (1977) discussed the possible  role of defoliating insects as regulators of primary production in the forest eco-system.  Both papers indicate the importance of quantifying these regulatory ef-fects.  Mattson and Addy further state that defoliators' ""feeding on and selective  destruction of some plants and plant propagules, [has] a strong influence on com-munity  composition, density, and succession.""  A simulation model based on the spatial distribution and growth of individual  trees could be used to quantify growth losses and stand development changes  resulting from tussock moth defoliation episodes. Such a model could represent  defoliation-causedc hangesi n stand developmentd ynamics, as well as short-term  growth losses. In addition, its outputs could be used to assess the effects of  defoliation on competitive relationships between trees.  Mitchell's (1975) Tree and Stand Simulator (TASS) was adapted for this study  to quantify growth losses and changes in stand dynamics due to defoliation.  Because TASS emphasizes individual tree crown development, with height  growth and radial increment being largely functions of crown characteristics, it  is well suited to quantify the growth affects associated with a defoliating insect  such as the tussock moth. The intertree competitive relationships in TASS allow  the role of tussock moth defoliation to be explored and quantified.  METHODS  Collection of Biological Data.--The field portion of this study was conducted in  northern Idaho on the Palouse and Clarkia districts of the St. Joe National Forest  and on nearby state and private lands, an area recently subjected to a tussock  moth outbreak (Tunnock 1973) resulting in a mosaic of defoliation levels. The  majority of the field work was completed during 1975. To include the growth  responsed uringt he postdefoliationp eriod, measurementso f defoliatedt rees were  completed after the 1977 growing season.  To provide the desired range of tree and stand conditions, sampling strata were  defined based on the following criteria: (1) tree species (Douglas-fir, grand fir, or  ponderosa pine), (2) tree height (less than 10 ft, greater than or equal to 10 ft but  less than 20 ft, and greater than or equal to 20 ft but less than or equal to 45 ft),  (3) competitive status (open grown or nearly so, moderate competition, and heavy  competition), and (4) defoliation level (light, moderate, severe, or none). Mod-erate  competition was recorded when the subject tree was bounded on two sides  by neighbors at least as large as the subject tree; heavy competition when the  686 / FOREST SCIENCE  subject tree was bounded on four sides by neighbors at least as large as the  subject tree. A neighbor was defined as a tree whose crown was touching the  subject tree's crown. Light defoliation was considered to be less than 40 percent  removal of new foliage; moderate defoliation between 40 to 70 percent removal  of new foliage; and heavy defoliation as greater than 70 percent removal of new  foliage (Table 1).  Percent slope, aspect, habitat type, and the locations of each plot tree relative  to the subject tree were collected on each study plot. Height in feet, diameter in  inches, and species were recorded for each subject and neighboring tree, and  each subject tree was felled to enable more intensive stem and crown measure-ments.  This procedure was similar to that used and described by Mitchell (1975).  All study plots and trees were located in either Abies grandistPachistima myr-sinites  or Thuja plicata/Pachistirna rnyrsinites habitat types (Daubenmire and  Daubenmire 1968).  Only Douglas-fir, grand fir, and ponderosa pine tree species were intensively  sampled; however, several other tree and shrub species occurred on many of the  plots and their location, size, and species were recorded. Other commonly oc-curring  coniferous species were western redcedar, Thuja plicata Donn, western  larch, Larix occidentalis Nutt., lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta vat. latifolia En-gelm.,  and western white pine, Pinus rnonticola Dougl. Ceanothus spp. were the  most frequently occurring shrubs.  Defoliation Data.---The most recent tussock moth defoliation in northern Idaho  occurred during 1971 through 1973, with heaviest defoliation in 1973 and lightest  in 1971 (Tunnock 1973). The outbreak was controlled with DDT in spring 1974.  Defoliatione stimatesf or all samplet rees were made in 1975, at least 2 years  after the actual time of defoliation. Defoliated sample trees were located in large  (•&gt;one-tenth of an acre) patches of advanced regeneration within mature stands or  adjacent to mature stands and were measured in the same manner as nondefo-liated  trees. Defoliation was measured as the proportion of foliage removed by  branch length by year from a minimum of one randomly selected branch per  whorl throughout the tree's live crown. No juvenile tree mortality directly attrib-utable  to tussock moth defoliation was encountered.  Except for defoliation relationships, model structure is essentially the same as  that described by Mitchell (1975); therefore, readers are directed to that paper  for detailed discussion of the structural and functional features of the simulator.  Defoliationr elationshipsa nd importantl inks, assumptionsa, nd aspectso f model  structure are examined in the following sections.  Model Parameterization.---TASS, originally developed for coastal Douglas-fir,  was parameterized to model interior Douglas-fir, grand fir, and ponderosa pine  using information from the trees described in Table 1. The link between defo-liation  and height growth for each host species will be covered in some detail  because height is an important determinant of system behavior. The relationship  between the proportion of grand fir foliage removed by tussock moth defoliation  and the proportion of height growth reduction the succeeding year is shown in  Figure 1. Althoughn ot presentedg raphically,t he relationshipb etweend efoliation  and proportion height growth reduction for Douglas-fir was linear over the range  of the data. The following straight line equation was fit to the data:  P = 1.139'D - 0.1359  where  P = proportion height growth reduction the year after defoliation  D = proportion of foliage removed.

Validation for Defoliation Effects.---To validate defoliation effects on height  growth, the sample tree data on differences in height accumulation after various  defoliation levels were compared with the simulated effects of defoliation. The  simulated trees represent conditions (age, size, crown position, site quality,  crown volume) similar to the actual trees. The important comparison is patterns  of height accumulation after defoliation. After moderate and even heavy defo-liation,  height accumulation has nearly returned to its original trajectory after 2  years. The model represents this pattern very well for both species (Figs. 2, 3).  Although not presented graphically, there was little discernible effect of light  defoliation.

RESULTS OF THE SIMULATION  The simulated effects of defoliation on the growth and development of juvenile  stands provide insights into the behavior of the system as well as into the tussock  moth's role in influencing the stand dynamics of the system. The dynamic inter-action  of species composition, stand density, age of the stand at defoliation, and  the number and intensity of the defoliation episodes is illustrated in selected  figures.  Frequency ofDefoliation.--Figure 4 contrasts the growth of a dense stand (initial  stocking of 643 TPA) of nondefoliated mixed species composition with the same  stand sustaining one heavy defoliation episode at ages 18 and 19. The nondefo-liated  stand exhibited the dynamic behavior characteristics of mixed species  stands. The heavy defoliation episode beginning at age 18 somewhat alters stand  development. The net effect measured at age 40 is summarized in Table 6.  Two defoliation episodes affect stand growth and development substantially  more than a single outbreak (Figs. 4 and 5 and Table 6). Light defoliation had  little impact on the volume accumulation of the stand. Volume accumulation in  stands with moderate defoliation fell between the values associated with light and  heavy defoliation.  Stand Density.---The results of a reduction in stand density, while species com-position  and defoliation episodes remained constant, are summarized in Table 6.  One and two defoliation episodes showed progressively greater reductions in host  volume with a concurrent increase in nonhost volume. However, these changes  694 / FOREST SCIENCE  $600. •600.  3400. / / 3400•  3200. CONTROL / 3•00. HFAV¾D FFOLIATIOANT  3000. / •000 . AGF$ 18 AND  2800. Grand fir ...............

Predictive Equations.--Although graphical representations of case study stands  are useful for understandingth e generalb ehavior of the simulateds ystem,o nly  a limited number of the 300 required for this study are practical. Thus, the results  of all simulations are summarized in Table 8.  The effect of defoliation on stand growth and development can be expressed  in various ways; therefore, five different equations are given in Table 8. The  dependent variables were selected because they are good indicators of defoliation  696 / FOREST SCIENCE  effectsa nd are helpfuli n summarya nalysiso f the simulationsT. he independent  variables in these equations were chosen because the simulated experiments,  outlined in Table 4, were designed to provide an acceptable range of these vari-ables.  The parameters were estimated using least squares regression analysis.  The dependent variables in Equations 2, 3, and 5 were transformed such that the  derived predictedv alues are mathematicallyb oundedb y 0 and 1.  DISCUSSION  Defoliation-induced changes varied according to stand conditions at the time of  defoliation. Increased growth of the nonhost ponderosa pine partially compen-satedf  or the reducedh osts peciesv olume.T he intertreec ompetitiver elationships  were altered to the advantage of nonhost trees.  Defoliation effects are cumulative; that is, the effect of two episodes is not  simply twice that of one outbreak. Rather, the vigor and position of the host trees  were reduced by the first defoliation; this change is reflected when the second  outbreak is applied. This important feature identified by simulation of defoliation  impactsis generallyn ot consideredin morec ommons tatisticaal pproachews hich  predict impacts as a function of various defoliation and stand variables, and ignore  the changing behavior of the stand.  Stand density also discerniblyi nfluencess tandb ehavior subsequent o tussock  moth defoliation, especially when the stand is defoliated twice. Because defo-liation  speeds up vertical differentiation of the stand, host trees occupying lower  crown positions fall farther behind their larger neighbors. In dense stands, more  of theses mallt reesd ied from suppressionW. hile their lossr educest otal volume,  merchantable volumes are not reduced correspondingly.  Change in proportion host volume at age 40 is perhaps the dependent variable  that best expresses defoliation-induced changes in stand dynamics (Equation 3,  Table 8). Change in proportion host is simply the difference in the proportion  host volume in the control (nondefoliated) and the defoliated stand.  Stands containing a large proportion of nonhosts at the first defoliation episode  show the greatest change in proportion host at age 40 because relatively more  ponderosa pine were available to respond to a temporary competitive advantage  (Fig. 7). Thus, not only was host volume directly reduced by defoliation, it was  further reduced by a lessened competitive situation for hosts and a corresponding  improvement for nonhosts.  Stand density at the first defoliation also influenced the response of the stand  to defoliation (Fig. 8). The change in proportion host increases until just after  crown closure (a CCF value of approximately 125), and then decreases. In open  stands, competition is not significant and ponderosa pine does not benefit from  a ""defoliation thinning effect""; therefore, the change in proportion host derives  primarily from defoliation-causedre ductionsi n host volume. As stand density  increasesc, ompetitionb eginst o affectp onderosap ine growtha nd it increasingly  respondst o an improvedc ompetitives tatus,u p to a point. After crown closure,  stand density increases and ponderosa pine loses live crown and thus its ability  to respond to a temporary competitive advantage. At high stand density there is  little increase in nonhost volume, and the change in proportion host again results  from defoliation-caused volume reductions.  The interaction between stand density and species composition and the result-ing  influence on change in proportion host is shown in Figure 9.

Therefore, the change in proportion host at high stand density is due to defolia-tion-  caused reductions in host volume, and on a proportional basis is the same  for both species mixtures. The results of this study support Smith's (1977) thesis  that even light to moderate defoliation levels may affect the dynamics of stand  development. If tussock moth defoliation directly resulted in tree mortality, the  effect of defoliation on stand dynamics would be greater than is portrayed in this  study.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  The tussock moth regulates primary productions and biomass accumulation over  time, primarily by redistributing growth energy from host to nonhost trees by  altering competitive relationships to the advantage of nonhost trees. The greatest  reduction in total volume occurs after two defoliation episodes.

The use of a high resolution simulation model to assess the growth response  of individual trees to defoliation and to show how these individual responses  collectively affect stand behavior over time has been demonstrated. Using the  growth simulator to replicate field situations is potentially the most powerful  application of the model because simulated outputs can help identify and bridge  information gaps.  Although this paper has concentrated on using the model to quantify the dy-namic  interactions of juvenile stand growth and development under tussock moth  VOLUME 27, NUMBER 4, 1981 / 699  defoliation episodes, the general approach potentially has much wider application.  For example, the model may also project the effects of numerous other natural  influences on stand behavior. One obvious use is in estimating the effects of other  defoliating insects, such as the spruce budworm, on juvenile stand growth and  development. The process would be very similar to the study here described.  Furthermore, this model, calibrated to include the effects of various other forest  pests (such as defoliating diseases, shoot and bud damaging insects, mechanical  damage, and growth impacting fungi), can be used to explore the role of these  agents in altering future dynamic behavior of the forest.

Mika  Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition cooperative  University of Idaho  Moscow, Idaho  Objective:  To develop equations for predicting the Douglas-fir site  index of a site based on the physical and soil characteristics  of the site. The equations were to be ranked according to the  ease of acquisition of any necessary data.  Data base:  All data for this analysis were collected on research  plots established by the IFTNC. Data sets on 414 plots were  complete with regards to site index and site characteristics  information. The associated plots cover six geographic  regions: central Idaho, northern Idaho, Montana, northeast  Oregon, central Washington and northeast Washington.  Douglas-fir site index for each plot was obtained from  site-specific height-age equations developed by Jim  VanderPloeg. These equations were evaluated at breast height  age 50 to obtain the plot site index.  site characteristics considered for predicting site index  are listed in Table 1. The variables are broken into five  groups based on the theoretical ease of acquisition of the  data. Information about the first group of variables-­elevation,  slope, aspect, and vegetation series--should be  readily available. Vegetation series is the potential dominant  climax tree species (in the sense of Daubenmire, Pfister,  Steele, etc.). The second group includes soil parent material­-  information which is becoming more available with the increase  in soil mapping. This information can be easily obtained by a  qualified observer making a visual examination of the site.  The third group includes soil depth and depth of any ash cap.  These require on-site evaluation but are fairly easy to  measure. The fourth group consists of soil chemical  characteristics requiring soil sampling and laboratory analysis  for determination. The last group includes soil moisture  holding capacity whose measurement requires intensive soil  sampling and a laborious analysis.  Analysis approach:  Standard. regression  predictive models. All  analysis was used to develop the  candidate predictor variables were  (  2  entered and the least significant ones were eliminated one-by­one.  A significance level qreater than 0.05 for the partial F  statistic was used as the elimination criterion.  Rather than develop separate models for each qeoqraphic  region, a sinqle model was fit usinq all 414 observations. The  influence of qeographic region was modeled directly by  including reqion interaction terms and testing for  siqnificance.  Five models were developed, each correspondinq to a given  level of difficulty in obtaininq the data necessary to drive  the model. Thus, the first model could only use variables  easily obtained--those in group 1 of Table 1. The second model  could involve any variables from the first or second qroup, the  third model could use any from the first three qroups and the  fourth model could use any variable from the first four qroups.  The fifth model could use any variable from any of the groups.  Results:  Analysis of the variables in qroup 1 indicated that each  contributed siqnificantly to explaininq the variation in site  index. The shape of the relationship was also determined to  vary siqnificantly across geographic reqions. Thus the model  formed from qroup 1 variables includes elevation, slope, aspect  and vegetation series; parameter estimates (given in Table SA)  chanqe with geoqraphic reqion.  The model for the second level of data availability-­groups  land 2--includes parent material alonq with all the  variables. Coefficients (Table 5B) aqain all vary with  qeographic region. The third level model adds ash depth  information to the previous model. Soil depth was found to be  non-siqnificant. Coefficients (Table 5C) remain dependent on  region.  The model for the fourth level includes information on  mineralizable nitrogen levels in the soil in addition to these  variables in the preceeding model. The coefficient for  mineralizable nitroqen was not found to be reqionally  dependent. Coefficients are presented in Table 50.  The model for the fifth level of data availability (all  possible variables considered) is shown in Table 2 with  coefficients given in Table 5E. The model adds soil moisture  holdinq capacity information to that present in the fourth  level model. The coefficient for moisture holding capacity was  found to vary significantly with qeographic region.  Statistical fit for each model is presented in Table 3.  Included are the sum of squares explained by the particular  model, the percentaqe of the total sum of squares explained,  '. ,i  ===  3  the standard error of the estimate for the model and the  standard error expressed as a percentage of the overall mean  site index. By proceeding from top to bottom through the  table, one can see the improvement afforded in site index  prediction by collection of more site information. The mean  and standard deviation of the site index sample are also shown  to provide reference standards.  Tables 4A through 4F provide similar model for data broken  down by geoqraphic region; the tables indicate the importance  of various terms in the model for explaining the pattern of  variation in site index within each region. Thus one can see  that information on soil parent material was not very useful in  central Idaho, northeast Oregon or northeast washinqton. To  contrast that, knowledge about soil parent material was very  helpful in predicting site index in Montana and central  washinqton, while information about other soil characteristics  was useful in northern Idaho. Measurement of soil moisture  holding capacity gave qreatest improvement of fit in central  Idaho and northeast Oregon.  certain parameter estimates raise questions as to how  ""good"" the estimates really are. For example, the negative  slope associated with soil moisture holding capacity in central  Idaho is both counter intuitive and contrary to the simple  correlation between site index and moisture holding capacity.  This could result from collinearity and/or overfitting. These  questions will be addressed in future analysis.  The general form of the various models are illustrated in  Figures 1 through 4. Figure 1 depicts the behavior of site  index with respect to changes in elevation and vegetation  series (Figure lA), and percent slope and aspect (Figure 1B)  for model 1 in northeast Washinqton. In Figure lA aspect and  slope are held constant at 258 degrees and 30 percent,  respectively. Figure 1B shows a grand fir series at 3000 foot  elevation. Figure 2 shows site index behavior with respect to  varying elevation and parent material for model 2 in Montana;  aspect, slope and vegetation series are 258 degrees, 30 percent  and Douglas-fir, respectively. Figure 3 illustrates the  behavior of model 4 in northern Idaho. Figure 3A shows how  site index varies with respect to mineralizable nitrogen and  ash depth, while Figure 3B depicts the influence of elevation  and vegetation series. When held constant, values for aspect,  slope, elevation, vegetation series, parent material, ash depth  and mineralizable nitrogen are 258 degrees, 30 percent, 3000  feet, qrand fir, ash over meta sediments, deep, and 45 ppm,  respectively. Figure 4 shows the relationship of site index to  soil moisture holding capacity and parent material in northeast  Oregon. Constant conditions are an aspect of 258 degrees, a  slope of 30 percent, an elevation of 5000 feet and 45 ppm of  mineralizable nitrogen on a Douglas-fir series with no deep ash  layer.

Growth and Yield of Leucaena in the Phillippines,"Goudie, J.W.; Moore, J.A.",Empirical yield tables for leucaena plantations in the Phillippines were developed. Site index and height growth equations were developed as components of leucaena growth and yield. The relationships between volume and biomass per ha and top height were quantified. The yield tables and site index equation can be applied in the Phillippines and perhaps other geographic areas where leucaena grows under similar edaphic and management conditions.

No. 11. November 1984 Lauren Fins and James A. Moore  ABSTRACT - An individual-tree simulation model called  Prognosis and an economic subroutine called CHEAPO  were used to determine financial rotation ages (in this  analysis defined as the age at which net present value is  maximized) for stands grown with genetically improved  and unimprOl!ed western larch (Larix occidentalis) in north  Idaho. Three hypothetical but reasonable growth functions  were tested on two site classes. Sensitivity analyses showed  that the tree improvement investment 1008 likely to be  profitable at 4 and 5 percent discount rates on excellent  sites and at 4 percent on good sites. The analysis was most  sensitive to changes in discount rate, site quality, and cone  production rate. It was moderately sensititte to variation in  time to seed production, number of productive orchard  years, and differences among the assumed biological func­tions.  As the hypothetical growth functions were designed  to be conservative, economic gains are likely to be laryer  than those indicated in the analysis.  Tree improvement programs may involve selection of  individual trees from throughout an ownership, establish­ment  of progeny tests and seed orchards, clonal propaga­tion,  matings between selected individuals in breeding or­chards,  and production of advanced generations of seed  orchards or clonal stock. Such programs involve costs in­curred  over many years prior to the return on investment.  Since the competition for investment dollars has intensified,  rigorous economic analysis has become a necessity. Pre­viously  published analyses have indicated that even with  relatively small genetic gains (well within attainable  amounts for most species), intensive high-cost programs  can be economically justified. In fact, most analyses have  shown that the return on investment is influenced more by  ehanges in diseount rates and management regimes than by  the expected genetic gains (Marquis 1973, Porterfield et al.  1975, Porterfield and Ledig 1977, Carlisle and Teich 1978,  Ledig and Porterfield 1981, 1982).  The main purpose of this article is to evaluate the eco­nomie  returns of a western larch tree improvement pro­gram  in north Idaho and to demonstrate the use of an  individual-tree simulation model to test the sensitivity of  the analysis to alternative eeonomie and biological assump­tions.  Unique to our study is an examination of three  hypothetieal growth funetions that describe the performance  of improved material under field conditions.  Assumptions  In any economic analysis of a tree imprm'ement program,  two kinds of biological information are particularly impor­tant:  the shapes of the growth curves for improved and  unimproved material, and the magnitude of the differences  between them m'er time. As little is known about growth  functions or volumes of improved material at rotation ages,  some previous authors have relied on regional yield tables  for unimproved stoek, and either assumed fixed inereases in  volume from the improved stock (Porterfield and Ledig  1977) or estimated the amount of gain necessary at fixed  harvest ages for programs just to pay for themselves (Ledig  and Porterfield 1981, 1982). These approaches work well for  ageneies eonstrained by legal mandates speeif)ing the time  of harvest, but many industrial organizations are better  served by analyses based on financial rotations. We there­fore  assumed neither fixed rotation ages nor fixed increases  in volume from the improved material throughout the rota­tion.  We based our analysis on the volumes and values at  eomputer-estimated financial rotations, testing three hypo­thetieal  but biologically reasonable growth functions for the  improved stoek.  In the Inland Empire, a computer-based, individual-tree  simulation model called the Prognosis Model for Stand  Development (Stage 1973, Wykoff et al. 1982) has been  designed and calibrated to predict growth and yield under  alternative management regimes. With Prognosis, the  shapes and magnitudes of the growth curves can be varied,  and volume gains can be estimated for each separate set of  assumptions. A subroutine called CHEAPO (Medema and  Hatch 1979) can be used to determine financial rotation  age (the age at which net present value is maximized).  Prognosis thus offers a highly sophisticated tool for analysis  using well-established growth information for alternative  management regimes and alternative hypotheses about dif­ferenees  between improved and unimproved trees.  In 1974, a cooperative tree improvement program was  started for western larch as part of the Inland Empire Tree  Improvement Cooperative. Rather than use one specific  member of the cooperative in our example, we here assume  an organization whose aim is to produce larch sawtimber on  a large land base in north Idaho. Our hypothetical organiza­tion  has selected 100 trees in the area of interest and  collected cones from them. Other cooperators have selected  an additional 200 trees and collected eones from them for  progeny tests. The initial seed orchard will include grafted  clones of the phenotypically best 100 selections from natu­ral  stands (Staubaeh and Fins 1983). Our organization is  responsible for establishing and maintaining one of three  10-acre progeny tests. Seedling needs are 1.3 million annu­ally,  enough to plant 2,400 acres per year at a spacing of 9  by 9 feet (538 stems per acre).  The organization will establish a 12-acre seed orchard  which when at full capacity will supply the seeds needed  annually. Modest genetic gains (specified below) are as­sumed  in the three hypothetical growth functions, including  small gains from phenotypic selection under field conditions  and early roguing of the orchard. Additional gains from  later roguing are not included in the analysis. These modest  gains are consistent with those predicted for southern  Idaho lodgepole and ponderosa pines, and Douglas-fir in the  Rocky Mountains (Rehfeldt et a1. 1980, Rehfeldt 1980, 1983)  and eonservative compared with those used in some other  NO\'EMB~:R 1984 675  Figure /.

Steps in the Analysis  Biological yields.-The Prognosis model was used to pro­ject  the biological yields for both the genetically improved  and unimproved stock. Three growth patterns were as­sumed  for the improved stock, and genetic gains were  expressed relative to the diameter and height growth of  unimproved stock over time. The resulting three functions  for the improved material were: (a) a constant volume ad­vantage  (equivalent to approximately 8 percent at 10 years);  (b) a constant proportional advantage (approximately 8  percent) through the rotation; and (c) a maximum volume  advantage of about 18 percent by age 20 years and a  decrease in both the absolute and proportional advantage  over the rotation until volumes were approximately equal at  maturity. The simulated volume yields lftg. 1) for each of  these assumptions were generated by using appropriate  multipliers for height and diameter growth functions in the  model. The growth assumptions for improved material were  chosen to be conservative.  Allalyzillg the costs alld bellefits.-The economic analysis  subroutine of the Prognosis Model, CHEAPO, was used to  analyze the costs and benefits associated with the projected  yields. The revenue produced by a regime is determined by  multiplying the volume removed times the regionwide  stumpage price for western larch. The costs of planting and  other management were identical for improved and unim­proved  stock, and therefore had no effect on the analysis.  667  1,631  6 pel.  13.123""  680  1.665  5 pCI.  15.041~  Net present value al  discount rates of -  693  1.695  4 Pel.  17.363""  _...•....

Table 1. Activity costs for the tree Improvement program  -base case.  Costs associated with the tree improvement program were  charged only to the improved material.  CHEAPO allows for cost and price appreciation or depre­ciation  over time at a specified rate. Most studies agree that  real prices of stumpage have increased at a rate of 3.0 to 3.5  percent over time (USDA Forest Service 1973, Mills et al.  1976, Christophersen et al. 1978). We assumed a 2.0 per­cent  stumpage price appreciation. We used real discount  rates of 4, 5, and 6 percent to determine the sensitivity of  the results to changes in the discount rate.  Our main criterion for preference of improved over unim­proved  material was financial optimization. That is, the  preferred option ....'38 the regime and rotation age that  produced the largest net financial gains as defined by net  present value (NPV). Some previous authors have used  similar approaches (Lundgren and King 1965, Schreuder  1971).  Mallagement regime.-One commercial low thinning was  scheduled at stand age 50. Financial rotations, based on  maximum NPV, were used for all growth assumptions.  Four managed-stand yield tables were produced for each  of two site classes: a good site and an excellent site for  western larch growth and development. The good site ap­proximated  a ThujalPachistima habitat type and the excel­lent  site ....'38 a TsugalPachistima (Daubenmire and Dauben­mire  1968).  Tree improvemellt assltmptiolls.-ln our base case we as­sumed  that seed production begins at year 7 after OI'charcl  establishment, and that the productive life of the orchard is  25 years. The orchard, planted initially at 28 by 7 feet (222  trees per acre) with 100 clones, occupies 12 acres. Final  average spacing will be 28 by 28 feet, with 25 clones remain­ing.  Seed yields are estimated at 0.5 Ib per bushel of  cones-enough to provide 7M plantable seedlings (USDA  1982). The progeny test occupies 10 acres and will be  maintained for 25 years. The costs listed for tree improve­ment  (table 1) were based on recent experience of local  managers.  Given our critical assumption of early seed production in  the base case, it was important also to examine the effects  of both delayed seed production and a compensating pro-  60 70  - Unlmprovod  6·· .. ·· .. · Conotont Volumo  0--- Conotont Porcont  0------ Laroo Eo,ly Difference  STAND AGE  50  /-:8 Excollont  //.

With the assumed 200 acres planted per year  per acre of seed orchard. site productivity and discount  rates were the most important factors influencing the re­turn  on investment. Small delays in seed production and/or  the five-year extension in orchard life'had lesser effects. At  the 4·percent discount rate on both sites, benefits exceeded  costs for all but the third case (i.e., seed production delayed  until year 12) on the good site. Profitability on the excellent  site proved variable at 5 percent, with only function B  consistently showing returns greater than costs for all  orchard cases. On the good site, only biological function B  combined with earliest seed production proved profitable at  5 percent. In no case was it profitable to plant improved  material at 6 percent.

Two features of the analysis are  longed productive life of the orchard. Our sensitivity analy­sis  included three additional sets of assumptions about  orchard production: beginning at 9 and 12 years and contin­uing  for 25 years, and beginning at 9 years and continuing  for 30 years. Table 2 gives total costs for the seed orchard  cases. Finally, we looked at the possibilities for breaking  even or reaping additional economic gains by planting the  maximum acreage possible with three alternative average  levels of seed production from the orchard.  Calculatiom of net present oolue.-Net present values  were calculated in a standard fashion by these formulas:  For a single sum paid in the nth year:  V = Vn (l)  o (1+i)""  where V is the sum paid in the nth year, i is the discount  rate, and n is the year in which the sum is paid. For a  series of terminable annual payments:  V = a (1 +i)"" - 1 (2)  () i(1 +i)""  where a is the amount paid yearly, i is the discount rate,  and n is the number of years the payment is made. When a  series of payments begins in a year after the start of the  program, formula 2 is applied first, and then formula 1 is  applied to the total to discount it to the beginning of the  program.

NOVEMBER 1984 677  difference between improved and unimproved material  (function B) produced the largest benefits (table 3), whereas  a constant volume difference between improved and unim­proved  material &lt;function A) produced the smal1est benefits  at all discount rates. Function C was intermediate. Infor­mation  is not available to determine which of the three  growth functions most closely resembles real growth  throughout a rotation. Scanty data for loblolly pine sug­gest  that any of the three functions may be reasonable  approximations for the first half of a rotation (Talbert  1981).  Neither site quality nor the differences among the three  growth functions influenced the financial rotation age, which  varied only with discount rate (table 3). We believe that the  financial rotations would have varied with growth functions  had we exaggerated the volume differences among them.  To test the effect of orchard productivity, we compared  our base case of 0.28 bushel of cones per orchard tree (0.14  Ib seed) to rates of 1.0, 0.4, and 0.2 bushel, yielding 0.5,  0.2, and 0.1 Ib of seed, respectively. If all seeds were used,  these yields would have allowed planting 725,307, 200, and  153 acres annually for every acre of seed orchard. To  compare those figures with the area that would need to be  planted each year per acre of seed orchard for the program  just to pay for itself, we used the formula:  Ac = ~  Y·Z  where X is the cost per acre of seed orchard, Y is the dollar  gains per acre planted, and Z is the number of productive  orchard years.

In table 5, we have schematically represented the possi­bilities  for economic gains if the maximum number of acres  were planted for all four cone production rates. It is impor­tant  to note that with orchard production at 2.5 times the  base case (Le., at 1.0 bu of cones per tree), an acceptable  return on investment was realized for all of the hypothe.  sized growth curves, discount rates, and orchard scenarios.  At 0.4 bu of cones per tree a return on investment was  realized for both sites at 4 percent, on the more productive  site at 5 percent, and for two-thirds of the cases on the less  productive site at 5 percent. At low orchard productivity  (0.2 bu of cones per orchard tree), neither site produced a  return at 5 or 6 percent. At 4 percent, the excel1ent site  produced returns, but on the less productive site results  were variable.  On the excellent site, at 0.28 and 0.2 bu of cones per tree  at the 5-percent discount rate, the break-even and maxi­mum  acres that could be planted were almost equal, indi­cating  that even small differences in biological functions  and orchard productivity could determine the profitability.  Therefore, accurate quantification of biological functions  and orchard scenarios is important for these conditions. On  good sites the analysis was similarly sensitive at 4-percent  discount rate at the lowest cone production rate.  Clearly, discount rate, site quality, and cone production  rate are the most important factors influencing profitabili­ty.  But if seed production from the orchard is kept high and  planting programs are large enough to use all of the seed,  profitability of the western larch tree improvement pro­gram  is virtually assured. •  Literature Cited  CARLISLE, A.. and A.H.

Seq"", I,':""  INTRODUCTION  In 1971 the University of Idaho in cooperation with the USDA Forest  Service, Potlatch Corporation, the Idaho Department of Lands, and several  other land management companies initiated a forest tree nutrition study to  evaluate the effects of thinning and nitrogen fertilization.1I Thirty-seven  installations were located on grand fir, western redcedar, and western  hemlock habitat types throughout northern Idaho. Each installation was lo­cated  in a predominately Douglas-fir or grand fir stand of reasonably uniform  structure. Stand ages ranged from 15 to 80 years. Each installation con­sisted  of eight, approximately' 1/10 acre (0.04 hal square Plots.£! Two  replicates of four treatments were randomly assigned:  1) control  2) fertilized only with 200 #/A of nitrogen as urea, applied in the  spring of 1972  3) thinned only to approximately 15 x 15 feet spacing the summer  and fall of 1971  4) thinned as in (3) and fertilized as in (2), above  Soil parent material underlying these forest stands include:  1) granites of the Idaho and Kaniksu Batholiths  2) basalts from the Columbia River basalt flows  3) metasediments of the Belt Supergroup  4) glacial deposits and  5) aeolian deposits of clay and volcanic ash  Thus, soils represented in this study vary greatly in texture, structure  and fertility.  11 McIntire-Stennis Project  2/ Four of the installations were actually a part of the same stand as 4 other  installations because each stand was a nearly equal mix of Douglas-fir and  grand fir. Therefore each stand with two installations actually consisted  of 12 plots (2 control, 2 fertilized only, 4 thinned in favor of Douglas­fir,  and 4 thinned in favor of grand fir; fertilization was super-imposed  on 2 plots of each thinning group). In the analysis, one of each double  installation was considered complete, the other was considered to have a  missing fertilizer-only treatment.  2  Recorded Data  The species and diameter of all trees on the plot were recorded when  the plots were installed. For thinned plots these measurements were recorded  only after the plots were thinned. On a subsample of trees on each plot  (6 to 10 trees), past la-year radial increment and total tree height was  measured. At subsequent two-year intervals over an eight-year period, diameters  were remeasured for all live trees on every plot and the heights of live trees  with previously recorded heights were remeasured. At each installation,  habitat type, stand age, slope, site index, and elevation were recorded.  Growth Summaries  Initial measurements and adjusted (for initial basal area) growth values  for 2, 4, 6 and a years following. treatment were standardized to represent  values per acre and then summarized in two ways. First, these values were  summed over all trees that were living when the stand was remeasured.  Mortality was summarized separately. Sums for successive measurement periods,  then, represent total growth on trees surviving since time of treatment  application (net growth).  Alternatively, the largest 140 trees per a:re represented by the plot  trees were evaluated. Trees that were dead by the a-year remeasurement  period and trees with dead or broken tops and old-growth residual trees  were excluded.  Mortality  The number and basal area of trees that died during each remeasurement  period was recorded. Mortality on fertilized-only plots was compared to  control plots for each remeasurement period (Figs 1 and 2). Mortality on  plots that had been thinned was low and was not analyzed.  3  Response Estimates  Net basal area and volume growth response to 200 #fA of nitrogen are  presented for unthinned stands in Tables 1 and 2 and for thinned stands in  Tables 3 and 4. Response values are presented for 4 remeasurement periods.  Comparing response by period should be done with caution, however, since  these values represent net response and therefore differ in number and size  from period to period.  Net basal area volume growth response to 200 #fA of nitrogen are presented  for the largest 140 trees per acre represented by each plot in Tables 5-6, for  unthinned stands, and Tables 7-8, for thinned stands.

A matrix of diameters at the same position on each tree is needed for PCA. Because relative position is typically used for stem taper analysis and our trees were different heights, diameters at 3, 5, and 10070 intervals to 90% of total height were estimated by quadratic interpolation from the actual diameters. A matrix of 1085 trees by 11 diameters was created with this procedure.  Simulated trees  The simulated trees used in this study were based on the following general model: tree stem profile = f(tree form, tree taper)  + random variation where tree form is the characteristic shape of the tree profile, tree taper is the rate of narrowing in diameter relative to increasing height along a tree stem for a given form (Gray 1956), and random variation is any other factor unrelated to form or taper. The specific model used to  generate the simulated stem profile data is 131  [1] d = (3 D I H -h  o H -BH 1  where d is the diameter at height h, Dis dbh, H is total tree height, h is any height along the tree bole, BH is breast height, and (30, and (31 are parameters related to taper and form, respectively. Ormerod (1973) introduced a model very similar to [1] for modeling stem profile for several tree species in British Columbia. Reed and Byrne (1985) used Ormerod's model as the basis for developing a variable-form stem profile system for red pine, jack pine, and white spruce in the upper Great Lakes region. Equation 1 was used by Newberry and Burkhart (1986) to construct variable-form and taper stem profile equations for loblolly pine. This model has parameters that are directly related to stem form and taper and has been shown to account for most of the variation in stem profile in the situations described above. Since we believe form and taper account for the vast major­ity of the variation in stem profile, we constructed the simulated tree data with [1] so that they varied in both form and taper.  A height-diameter model fitted to the sample trees was used to generate total heights for 2.5 cm diameter classes  (12.7 to 63.5 cm or 5 to 25 in.). Twenty trees were con­structed for each diameter class. Four different diameters for each diameter class were randomly obtained by assum­ing a uniform distribution over each class. For each of the four diameters, five different heights were assigned. The a variance equal to the variance of prediction of the height­diameter model. Once the simulated tree diameters and heights were determined, each diameter and height pair was tripled and assigned one of three geometric shapes: cone, paraboloid, or neiloid. Equation 1 was then used to generate stem diameters at the same relative stem positions used with the actual sample trees. Thus, a matrix of 420 trees by 11 diameters was created for each geometric shape.  Methods and results  Theoretical aspects  Chatfield and Collins (1980) indicate that when all the original variables are positively correlated, the first principal component is a measure of ""average size"" or shape. Since diameters along a tree bole are, in most cases, positively cor­related, the eigenvector associated with the first principal component gives the ""average"" profile of the trees being studied.  Two results from matrix algebra are also useful. First, the number of nonzero eigenvalues for the variance­covariance matrix is equal to the rank of the observation matrix (Graybill 1976; Morrison 1967). Second, the number of principal components is equal to the number of nonzero eigenvalues in the variance-covariance matrix (Morrison 1967). If we consider these results along with the stem pro­file model [1], further theoretical interpretations can be made about principal components of stem profile. If trees with a single stem form but different taper are considered, the stem profiles for these trees are linearly dependent, since each is a simple linear transformation (based on dbh) of the appropriate form. Therefore, the rank of the matrix of dia­meters from trees with a single form and different taper is equal to one. If, however, multiple tree forms are con­sidered, those profiles from trees with the same form are linearly dependent, and hence, the rank of the diameter matrix in this case would be equal to the number of stem forms present. Since the number of principal components is equal to the rank of the diameter matrix, the number of principal components is equal to the number of stem forms in the population of trees.  From this, two points seem evident. First, the first prin­cipal component is the measure of average stem form. Second, the number of principal components is equal to the number of stem forms present in the tree population given model [1].  Simulated trees  Principal components analysis was applied to each of the three simulated tree data sets. The first principal compo­nent explains 100% of the total variance in each of the simulated diameter matrices. Therefore, each diameter matrix with one stem form has only one nonzero principal component. The plot of the eigenvector associated with the first principal component versus relative height for each geometric shape is given in Fig. 1. For clarity, the elements of each eigenvector have been joined by line segments and the value zero assigned to 100% of total height. Each figure duplicates the geometric shape of the diameter matrix from which they were derived.  Next, PCA was applied to a diameter matrix made up of all three geometric shapes. The results are provided in 1540  0.1  CAN. J. FOR. RES.

Elements of the first eigenvectors versus relative height for simulated trees of three geometric shapes.  Table 2. There are three nonzero principal components associated with this diameter matrix. The fIrst principal com­ponent is by far the most important since it alone explains approximately 98070 of the variation in diameter. A plot of the eigenvectors associated with the three principal com­ponents versus relative height is shown in Fig. 2. The plot of the first eigenvector appears to be a combination of the three shapes included in this data set. The plots of the other two principal components do not have an easily interpretable pattern. The correlations between the elements of these eigenvectors and the stem diameters for the simulated trees are given in Table 3. The elements of the fIrst eigenvector show strong correlations with all diameters aong the tree stem. The highest correlations are between 10 and 40% of total height. The elements of the second eigenvector are not as highly correlated with the stem diameters as are the elements of the first eigenvector. The highest correlations with the elements of the second eigenvector are associated with diameters near the top of the tree. The elements of the third eigenvector are only weakly correlated with diameters along the tree stem.  Sample trees  The results of PCA applied to the 1085 sample Douglas­fir trees are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. The first com­ponent is by far the most important, as it was with the simulated trees, since it alone explains 95.4% of the total variation. The second component accounts for 3.5% of the variation, and the remaining components account for about 1% of the variation. The elements of the first eigenvector show a similar correlation structure with sample tree bole diameters as was shown with the simulated trees. Again all the correlations are positive and the highest correlations are associated with bole diameters between 10 and 40% of tree height. The elements of the second eigenvector show a weaker correlation structure with bole diameters than the elements of the first eigenvector. The pattern of correlations is similar to the simulated trees, although the similarity is not as strong as with the fIrst eigenvectors. The strongest correlations again are in the upper portion of the tree stem. The elements of the third eigenvector also show the same correlation pattern as did the elements of the third eigen­vector from the simulated trees. Again the correlations are very weak.  A plot of the elements of the fIrst three eigenvectors versus relative height is shown in Fig. 3. Clearly, the plot of the  -0.4  I m  I!!

The plots of the second and third eigenvectors closely resemble the plots of the second and third eigenvectors from the simulated data.  Discussion and conclusion Principal components analysis applied to the simulated and the Douglas-fIr sample tree data sets gave results that are very similar. The plots of the elements of the fIrst three eigenvectors from both data sets show almost identical patterns. The elements themselves are also very similar. Correlations between the elements of the eigenvectors and tree stem diameters are approximately the same in both sign and magnitude. We did not expect the results between the two data sets to be identical for two reasons: first, there is variation in the Douglas-fir data set that is not found in the simulated trees and second, the neiloid form included in the simulated data is not generally a form associated with Douglas-fIr. Results from a combined cone-paraboloid data set were in many ways closer to the Douglas-fir data than the simulated data we presented here. We purposely chose the three-form data set so that there would be three non­zero eigenvalues. Based on the similarities between the two data sets, we contend that interpretations made about prin­cipal components based on theoretical considerations and the simulated data are applicable to the Douglas-fir sample trees. We also believe, because the simulated data are not species specific, these results are also applicable to other species with excurrent boles. Therefore, based on the results of our analysis, the first principal component should be interpreted as a measure of average tree stem form. The second principal component indicates the variation in tree stem form not explained by the first component. The correlation analysis of both data sets with stem diameters indicates most of the variation in form occurs in the upper portion of the tree bole. The third component is not readily interpretable. Given the results of the correlation analysis, we are unsure as to the signifIcance of this component. Here it is important to note that none of the eigenvectors appears to be related to stem taper as we define it, given the similarities between the simulated and real profile data.

Our results show that the first component is the average tree stem form and not profile or taper. The association of basal swelling with the second prin­cipal component (Fries and Matern 1966) is not supported by this analysis. The second component is most highly related to upper stem diameters in both the simulated and Douglas-fir sample tree data sets. Fries and Matern (1966) indicate the third component is an expression of stem form. We cannot interpret the third component in the context of stem profiles and are unsure about its significance. However, we do not believe it is an expression of stem form since the first component indicates form.  There are many analyses where it may be important to partition tree profiles into form and taper separately, since various biotic (for example, species, stand density, crown characteristics) and abiotic (for example, elevation, slope, soil substrate) factors may differentially affect stem form and taper.

Effects of Nitrogen Fertilization on Growth of Grand Fir and Douglas-Fir Stands in Northern Idaho,"Shafii, B.; Moore, J.A.; Olson, J.R.","A study of nitrogen fertilization response in thinned and unthinned stands of grand fir (Abies grandis) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in northern Idaho showed that the application of one urea nitrogen treatment applied at a rate of 200 lb N/ac resulted in a significantly higher average basal area growth over a 6-year post-treatment period. Nitrogen fertilization also resulted in a significant height increment increase over the same period. Fourteen years after treatment, fertilization had increased average tree size, in terms of total cubic volume, by 14% in unthinned and by 23% in thinned stands. A comparison of thinned and unthinned stands suggested an increase in tree size (&gt;300%) over the same period without significant reduction in average total cubic volume per acre.

Fertilization is most often used  to increase stand growth rate. De-pending  on a stand's site quality and  nutritional status, nitrogen fertiliza-tion  can accelerate tree growth,  yielding higher stand volumes at a  givena ge, or providea reductiono f  the rotation age (Powers 1980, Miller  1981).  The magnitude, duration, and dis-tributiono  f responseto nitrogenf ertil-izer  for forest stands located in the Pa-cific  Northwest has been frequently  investigated(e .g., Waringa nd Young-berg1  972,C ochran1 979,M iller et al  1979, Brix 1981, RFNRP 1987, IFTNC  1987), but little information is avail-able  for grand fir.

A University of Idaho McIntire-  Stennis (MS-16) study provided data  from 13 nitrogenfe rtilizationa nd thin-ning  installations that were estab-lishedi  n the early1 970s(S canline t al.  1978). These sites provided 14 years of  post-treatmenst tem height (a sub-sample)  and diameter measurements  for all trees. Measurements were ob-tained  every 2 years (from 1971 to  1979), and the last measurement was  conducted in 1985. All tree heights  were measured at the end of the  growth period; however, only approx-n-  natel2y0 %o f treeh eightsw erem ea-sured  at the beginning of the experi-ment.

DISCUSSION  Thinned and unthinned stands of  Douglas-fira nd grand fir in Northern  Idaho appear to respond initially in  averageb asala reag rowtht o nitrogen  fertilization 6 years following treat-ment.  The basal area response esti-mates  for the two periods for the  unthinned plots are higher than those  reported for the IFTNC (1986)  Douglas-firt rials locatedi n the same  region. Duration of basal area re-sponse,  however, is short-lived (4  years) in unthinned stands, perhaps  due to high density, which probably  did not allow for an increase in foliar  biomassa fter treatmentI.t is probable  that nitrogenc ontinuest o influence  stand dynamicsa nd subsequendt e-velopment  beyond the four-year pe-riod.  Nitrogen fertilization in un-thinned  Douglas-fir and grand fir  stands reduced average density by  about 100 trees per acre over the 14-  yearp ost-treatmenpte riod.T hisc on-tributes  to an increase in the average  tree size relative to the untreated  stands. Additional treatment related  mortality was concentrated in the  smaller size classes. The lightly  thinned stands showed trends similar  to unthinned stands.  Nitrogen applied to thinned stands  producedb othl owera veragea bsolute  and relativer esponsed uringt he first4  years following treatment as com-pared  to fertilized unthinned plots.  However, duration of response ap-pears  to be longer than in unthinned  standsa nd remainss ignificanat fter 6  years.  A negative though nonsignificant  fertilizationre sponsneo tedi n thinned  stands during later periods (years  9-14) may be related to inital differ-ences  in stand structure. Thinning  type and intensity differed both  within and between installations  studied. Some stands were only  lightly thinned while others were  thinned heavily, and some received  mechanical thinning while others  were thinned either from below or  from above in order to achieve strict  spacingo bjectivesT. hesei nitials truc-tural  differences influence mortality,  and in turn, tree size distributions.

The plots were thinned and fertilized in a manner similar to the MS-16 plots. A combination of low thinning and spacing guidelines with the target spacing from 10 X 10ftupto15 x 15ftwasused for this study.  Potlatch Corporation experiments, established in the late 1970s, provided a third data'set containing plots from seven installations with a range of fertilization treatment levels. However, only a subset of three installations, containing 24 plots with the same treatment arrangement as the MS-16 study, were included in this analysis. Six years of post-treatment growth measurements were available from these data. The square plot sizes varied from 0.1 to 0.25 acres. Various methods of thinning (i.e., mechanical, chemical, commer­cial) were used in these installations with spacing guidelines rang­ingfrom 12 x 12to 15 x 15ft.  Although all installations were permanent and periodically remeasured, the time since treatment and remeasurement interval varied. Thus, increment cores from a subset of trees were used to standardize growth periods across the data sets. From each data source, only trees with recorded annual increment cores were included in the analysis. One increment core was extracted from each sample tree from the side facing plot center. The annual radial increments were measured using a digital measuring system to ± O.OI-mm resolution. Fourteen-, 10-, and 5-year periodic radial increments were then calculated from the annual increments. Radial increments were doubled to obtain diameter increments. Individ­ual tree records were edited for species codes, tree age, initial diameter, condition codes, treatment codes, and unusual height and diameter increments. Errors detected were checked with the field data, corrected where necessary, or were the basis for reject­ing the tree. The number of individual tree observations obtained from each of the data sources, MS-16, lTC, and Potlatch, were 1670, 209, and 538, respectively. The distribution of selected men­surational characteristics of the three data sources are given in Table I. The study areas were second-growth even-aged stands composed primarily of grand fir and Douglas-fir species.  The MS-16 data were used to develop several diameter incre­ment models. The ITC and Potlatch studies were used as indepen­dent test data sets. Diameter-increment models were constructed for growth periods of 14, 10, and 5 years. Based on the length of the growth period since treatment, observations from ITC and Potlatch sou,ces were employed, accordingly, for 10-and 5-year model validation.  Analysis  PROGNOSIS is an individual-tree, distance-independent growth simulation model used extensively in the mixed­species types of the Inland Empire region. The diameter-increment model (a primary component of the simulator) used in PROGNOSIS has been proven to work well for forests in the region. Thus, a modified version of the PROGNOS[S diameter-increment model was used as the first attempt in quantifying the fertilization effect on diameter growth in thinned and unthi~ned stands. . .  The PROGNOSIs-type diameter-increment prediction model was specified as follows:  [1] DIS = (30 + H~B + TRT + SPcs + (3tCASP  +  (32SASP + (33SL + (34SL2 + (35EL  +  (36EL 2 + (37CR + (38CR 2 + (39(cCFd100)  +  (3 IORDBH + (3I1LDBH X TRT  + (3dBA/lOO) X TRT  where DIS In(DDS), DDS represents squared inside-bark diameter growth, In indicates the natural (base e) logarithm (30 = constant term representing the overall regression intercept HAB = dummy variable representing habitat type (!huja plicatalPachistima myrsinites = WRCI P) (Abies grandislP. myrsinites = GFIP) TRT dummy variable representing treatment type (control = C, fertilized = F, thinned = T, thinned and fertilized = F + T) SPsc = dummy variable representing species (grand fir = GF, Douglas-fir = DF) SL = stand slope percent CASP SL COS(ASP), ASP represents the stand aspect (deg.)

The diameter increment, as defined above, is derived from the periodic change in the squared inside-bark diameter (DDS), which is proportional to the periodic basal area growth:  2  DDS = (DlB + R)2 -DlB= 2DIB X R + R2  where DlB = diameter inside-bark at the beginning of the growth period R = periodic DIB increment  The model includes three dummy variables expressing the differential effects (direction of shift in the intercept as well as change in the slope) of habitat type,treatment, and species on DI~' HAB is specified at two levels: A. grandis/  P. myrsinites and T. pficata/P. myrsinites (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968). TRT is specified at four levels: control, fertilized (200 Ib N/acre), thinned, and thinned and fer­tilized. SPCS is specified at two levels: grand fir (A. grandis (Doug.) Lindl.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco).  The site factors included in the model, i.e., slope, aspect, habitat type, and eievation, are the same as those given in the PROGNOSIS diameter-increment model specification. The specific expressions used to incorporate the effects of aspect, slope, and habitat type on tree growth are those suggested by Stage (1976). No attempt was made to consider other forms or alternate expressions for these variables.  The growth model also includes, as independent variables, a measure of stand density (BA), as well as two measures of relative competitive status (RDBH and CCFL)' Originally, three measures of stand density and five measures of com­petition were considered. The measures of stand density were basal area (BA), crown competition factor (CCF), and num.­ber of trees per acre (TPA). The measures of individual-tree competitive status were relative dbh (RDBH, defined as dbh of subject tree/ASD), relative basal.area (RBA, defined as BA of subject tree/stand's average BA per tree), relative crown competition factor (RCCF, defined as CCF of subject tree/stand's average CCF per tree), basal area in larger trees (BAL' defined as BA in trees larger than the subject tree; i.e., BAL for the largest tree in the stand = 0, and BAL for the smallest tree in the stand = accumulated sum of BA for all the other trees in the stand); and crown competition factor in larger trees (CCFL, defined in the same manner as BAL)'  A stepwise regression procedure (backward elimination technique) was employed to select a subset of the aforemen­tioned variables with the highest contribution to the model. The selection technique was performed only on the eight competition-related variables above, keeping the other site and tree variables as specified in the model. At each step, the density and (or) competition variable showing the smallest contribution to the model was deleted, until the remaining variables in the model (i.e., BAL' ROBH, and cCFd produced F statistics significant at the a = 0.05 level (Table 2). 1152  CAN.

Inter­actions were included to test for differential increments (changes in slope) associated with each treatment level. No other form or order of interactions, including those associated with species and site factors, were found to be statistically significant and were not included in the final model.  Since site index is a commonly used method for estimating site quality, a second diameter-increment model was for­mulated by replacing the seven site-dependent terms in [1] with the site index. Using the site index as the measure of site quality makes the model more parsimonious. This elim­inates collinearity among the site factors and reduces the potential for ill conditioning between these and other regres­sion variates in the model.  This diameter-increment model took the form  [2] DIS = (30 + TRT + SPcs + (3JsI + (32cR  + (33cR2 + (34(CCF L/100) + (35RDBH  + (36LDBH X TRT + (37(BA/100) X TRT  where SI = grand fir site index (feet at 50 years, breast height) and all the other terms are as previously defined. The same selection procedures and statistical criteria were used in deciding the density, competition, and appropriate interaction terms to be included in this model.  The grand fir site-index curves developed by Stage (1959) were used for grand fir stands, and for Douglas-fir stands, Monserud'~ (1985) equations were used. The appropriate conversion equations developed by Deitschman and Green (1965) were applied to estimate the grand fir site index. The use of eq. [2] depends on the availability of appropriate site­index equations and site trees. If site-index estimates are not available, then eq.[I] could be used.  Results and discussion  Regression results for models [1] and [2] were similar over  the specified grO\\1h periods. All slope coefficients associated  with the continuous variables were significant, and had com­parable  standard errors for all three growth periods. The  R 2 values associated with eq. 1 for 14-, 10-, and 5-year  growth periods were 0.71,0.72, and 0.69, respectively. For  eq. 2, the R 2 values were 0.70,0.70, and 0.68 for the three  grO\\1h periods. Residuals from both models showed no bias  when displayed by all tree, density, and competition  variables as well as the predicted value of DIS. Regression  results for both diameter-increment models are provided in  Tables 2 and 3. The results indicate an insignificant intercept  effect for thinning treatment across all gro\\1h periods. How­ever,  the differential increment for all treatment combina­tions  is highly significant across diameter and initial basal  area for the specified growth periods. It is clear that thin­ning treatment has significantly affected individual tree  •l  basal-area increments across the diameter classes and initial  density within the stands. The same is true for the fertiliza­tion  treatments.  Because inclusion of SI in place of site factors given in  eq. 1 did not substantially affect the overall fit and (or) the  statistical significance of individual terms in the model, par­ticularly  with respect to fertilization, subsequent results and  discussion will focus on eq. 2. However, there was one dif­ference  in the results the two models: the use of SI caused  less variation to be accounted for by site factors and cor­respondingly  more by density variables.  The behavior of the predicted diameter-increment model  (l4-year growth period; grand fir species) is shown in two­dimensional  plots of DDS versus dbh and BA, Figs. 1 and 2,  respectively. The values of other independent variables in  each \figure were held constant at their treatment means.

Predicted 14-year individual-tree basal area increment versus initial basal area per acre for grand fir.  Because of the logarithmic transformation of the dependent variable, DIS, a correction factor suggested by Baskerville (1972) was used to account for the bias introduced in the predicted value of DIS as a result of the transformation.  The shape of the DDS curve relative to dbh for all treat­ment combinations is a monotonically increasing function with no apparent maximum within the range of the avail­able data (see Table 1). The quadratic term (LDBH)2 was  •  . not significant, probably because the data comprised only 80/0 of trees larger than 12 in. in diamter (1 in. = 2.54 cm). The monotonically decreasing shape of the increment \ function in Fig. 2 indicates declining individual-tree diameter  I  increment as the stand density (BA) increases. The position of the increment curves by treatment changes as stand den­sity varies. This is consistent with the results given in Table 3, indicating significant interactions between BA and TRT levels. Tree diameter increment was higher for thinned stands of lower density (BA :$ 150 ft 2/acre). There was no treatment difference in tree diameter increment for higher stand den­sities. Thinning, as expected, results in the largest individual­tree diameter increments in lower stand densities. These results are consistent with those reported by Reukema and Bruce (1977) and Seidel (1987).  Individual tree response to nitrogen fertilization is illustrated in Fig. 3.

Thinned stands of lower density produce more individual-tree fertil­ization response (Fig. 3b). The response curve for individ­ual trees in unthinned stands is nearly flat across the range of densities included in this study. These results are consis­tent with those obtained from a stand-level growth response analysis of the same installations (Shafii et al. 1989). Site quality, no matter how it is expressed in the models, affected overall growth rates and, therefore, the amount of fertilization response. However, as indicated by nonsignifi­cant interactions with treatment, site quality does not affect within-stand distribution of fertilization response. The lat­CAN. 1. FOR. RES.

The plotted values at eachI setting of the specified explanatory variables are the means ± 2 SD. The residuals do not show any nonlinearities; their 1 variability appears to be approximately constant; and they demonstrate small bias. Residual plots for other explanatory variables not shown here, and those of 5-and 10-year regres­sion equations produced similar results. The average residual was nearly zero for both fertilized and nonfertilized stands. The two independent data sets, ITC and Potlatch, were used to validate the results of the 10-and 5-year growth models, respectively. In each case, estimated coefficients of the diameter growth model developed from the MS-16 data  ... set (Table 2) were used in an equation to predict the DIS value associated with each tree in the test data set. The residuals defined as the squared difference between observed and predicted values of DIS were then used for model valida­tion. Residual plots similar to those given for the 14-year growth equation were constructed and examined for the test­data sets: ITC (Figs. 4c and 4d) and Potlatch (Figs. 4e and 4f). All residuals for both test-data sets, including those of other independent variables not shown here, conformed to the expected pattern and were unbiased. In addition, distribution of residuals by the indicator variable TRT for both test-data sets produced means very close to zero and relatively comparable standard deviation (Shafii 1988). In summary, the individual-tree diameter-increment models pro­duced consistent results over all growth periods, demon­strated favorable statistical properties, and performed well in tests with independent data sets.  Conclusions  The individual-tree growth response analysis clearly showed the impact of nitrogen fertilization in changing the distribution of diameter increments across tree size classes within a stand. This would result in a long-term alteration of stand structure by speeding up the process of crown differentiation.  Larger trees showed more growth response to nitrogen treatments than smaller trees, suggesting that merchantable volume responses and the corresponding economic returns are greater than total VOlume-response estimates indicate. The greatest fertilization response occurred for trees in thinned stands of low density. Trees growing in stands that were lightly thinned (i.e., those with high basal area after  , thinning) produced much less individual tree growth than \ those of low density after thinning. Similar patterns were evident for the fertilization treatment.  , Other research indicates that fertilization (i) accelerated height, basal area, and volume growth through time (espe­cially for Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western hemlock species (Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative 1987; Regional Forest Nutrition Research Project 1987»,  (ii) accelerated mortality of smaller trees in a stand, and  (iii) caused changes in stand development and alteration in the distribution of increments (Bolstad and Allen 1987; Jorgensen and Wells 1987). The results of this study con­firm that nitrogen fertilization, particularly in thinned stands, is an effective treatment to increase grand fir and Douglas-fir growth in northern Idaho.  The diameter growth predictive models performed well in tests with independent data sets. The new equations, when incorporated into existing individual-tree growth and yield simulation models, should provide valuable tools for evaluating fertilization treatments, particularly the tradeoffs between individual-tree size and total stand yield.

METHODS  The databasefo r this paper origi-nated  from Intermountain Forest Tree  Nutrition Cooperative(I FTNC) study  sites. The IFTNC study area was de-lineatedi  nto six geographirce gions:  (1) northern Idaho, (2) western Mon-tana,  (3) central Idaho, (4) northeast  Oregon,( 5) centralW ashingtona, nd  (6) northeasWt ashingtonN. inety-four  standsw ere selecteda nd 572 perma-nent  sample plots installed by fall  1982.

This resulted in a sam-pling  intensityo f approximatel5y to  10 trees/acw, hichi s roughlyt he same  proportiono f the populations ampled  by Monserud's(1 984)s ix trees/acT. o-pographica  nd vegetativein formation  was collecteda t eachp lot. Frome ach  felled tree, 13 height-agep airsw ere  obtained(a t breasth eight,b aseo f the  active crown and for each of the  past 11 years). A total of 578 trees  throughout he six regionsr emained  for furthera nalysisa fters creeninfgo r  suppressions, tem defects,a nd insect  or diseasein fluencesIn. determining  site index, the site rather than an indi-vidual  tree is of primary interest.  Therefore, an average growth curve  (height vs. age) was determined for  each installation from the individual  tree stema nalys•sd ata. Thts• s s•rmlar  to the procedure followed by Mon-serud  (1984). The trees from each in-stallationw  ere used to fit a site-spe-cific  height-age equation. Evaluating  this equationfo r eachs itea t indexa ge  of 50 yields an estimate of site index  for the installation. Since the data is  from second-growth Douglas-fir  stands with a mean age of 63 years,  obtaining height-age data points for  the past1 1 yearsr esultedin manyo f  the sample trees having a direct height  measurement at age 50. This was im-portant  in minimizing extrapolations  in calculatings ite index values.T hese  site index values were then used in all  subsequent analyses for deriving  height growth and site index equa-tions.  The means and ranges of  various site factors encountered at in-stallations  within each region are  given in Table 1.  RESULTS  A residuala nalysisw as conducted  comparing ""observed"" decadal  heights obtained from each site-spe-cifich  eight-agefu nctiont o those"" pre-dicted""  from Monserud's habitat-type-  specifich eight growth equation.  When each region was compared  across all age classes, northern and  central Idaho, northeast Oregon, and  northeast Washington showed good  agreement. However, those for Mon-tana  and centralW ashingtonre vealed  some bias and suggested a height  growth pattern different than Mon-serud's  equation (Figure 1). Negative  values on the graphs indicate an over-prediction  by Monserud's equation.  The vertical line through each data  point representsth e standarde rror of  Monserud's height growth function  for that decade. Based on these  findings along with the fact that the  IFTNC sites in Montana and central  Washington are the farthest from the  area sampled by Monserud, new  height growth and site index curves  were developed for those regions  from IFTNC data. The new curves for  Montana were compared to Mon-serud's  (1984) Douglas-fir series  curves, and the new curves for central  Washington were compared to both  Monserud's and Cochran's (1979).

Residual plots  were significantly improved by in-cluding  habitat series.  DISCUSSION  Comparison of height growth  models for both regions showed sire-ilar  height growth patterns below  index age. Ttus suggeststh at height  developmenot f young Douglas-firis  essentially the same from western  Montana to the east side of the Cas-cade  crest. However, past index age,  existingc urvesf or both regionso ver-estimateh  eightg rowth,p articularlya t  lower levels of site quality. In Mon-tana,  height growth on poor and me-dium  sites slows down more than  Monserud'sc urvesp redict.S imilarly,  in central Washington the curves  begin to depart at higher ages across  all site levels. By age 80 or 90, differ-encesin  predictedh eightw ere 5 to 8.5  ft for site indices below 85. Many of  the IFTNC sites in Montana and cen-tral  Washingtonw ere on Douglas-fir  habitat types drier than any of Mon-serud's  sites, so it seems reasonable  that the height growth would be  slower in older stands.  Habitat series-specific site index  curves were developed from the  IFTNC sites in central Washington.  Although the overall site index equa-tion  for central Washington per-formed  adequately, the Douglas-fir  (DF) series equation improved predic-tions  on poor and medium sites, while  the grand fir (GF) series equation per-formed  well on good sites. Site index  for the DF seriesa veraged6 6 ft with a  range of 47-84, while the GF series  averaged 81 with a range of 67-92.  High sites are lacking in the DF series  and poor sites are missing in the GF  series. When Monserud (1985) com-pared  his curves to Cochran's, Mon-serud  used his DF series coefficients  for site index less than or equal to 70,  and the GF series coefficients for site  index higher than 70. Based on the re-sults  of this study, site index 70 ap-pears  a good choice for the transition  from using the DF series equation to  the GF series formulation. Therefore,  comparisonsd iscussedh ere used the  same approach.  Overall, the new site index curves  for centralW ashingtonm atcht hoseo f  Monserud and Cochran well. The  largestd ifferenceso ccuro n site index  55 at age 10 (7.8 ft) and site index 85 at  age 90 (6.9 ft). More significantlya, t  higher ages Cochran (1979) overesti-mates  $I on poor sites while both  Monserud and Cochran underesti-mate  SI on good sites. For example, a  90-year-old tree 120 ft tall on a grand  fir habitat series would indicate a site  index of 81.4 ft with Monserud's GF  series equation, 84.1 ft using  Cochran'sm odela nd 86.8 ft according  to the new GF series curve.  The new overall site index equation  (4) for centralW ashingtons houldb e  used if habitat series is not known. If  the habitat series is DF or GF then the  habitats eriess pecificc oefficientcsa n  be used.

The new site index curves for Mon-tana  were compared to Monserud's  DF series curves. Poor sites matched  well, but by SI 75, noticeable differ-ences  in curve form were evident. Past  index age (50) Monserud's curves are  highert han the proposedc urves.D if-ferencesa  re greatesta t SI 85 (4 ft at  age 80).  Height growth and site index equa-tions  presented here for Montana  apply only for Douglas-fir habitat  types. Milner (1985) has demonstrated  that on grand fir and western red-cedar  types in Montana, Monserud's  curves perform quite well. Milner's  sampleo n Douglas-firt ypesi n Mon-tana  produced results similar to this  study.  In summary, height growth equa-tions  developed by Monserud from  stem analysis data collected in  northern Idaho perform well  throughout Idaho, northeast Wash-ington,  and northeast Oregon.

As implemented in version 6, the extension is calibrated only  for applications of 200 lb nitrogen applied in the form of urea. Direct and indirect  effects are based on growth 10 years after treatment for diameter effects, and 6 years  after treatment for height effects. Mortality is not affected in the model. After 10 years,  only indirect effects are represented through the normal dynamics of the Prognosis  Model. Control of timing is provided through a keyword, the parameters of which are  documented in this note.  ______________  KEYWORDS: Douglas-fir, grand fir, diameter increment, height increment  A new subroutine that represents response to fertilization has been added to version  6.0 of the Prognosis Model for Stand Development (Stage 1973). At this time,  coefficients for growth response relative to no fertilization are based on 91 permanent  plots located in northern Idaho. Differences between treatment and no-treatment after  a 10-year period are used for the diameter-growth response. Responses in height  increment are based on 6-year data.  Although accretion, which is based on the height and diameter increments of  individual trees, is obviously an important component of growth, so is mortality. There  is, however, no representation of mortality effects directly related to treatment in this  model. Available evidence indicates that fertilization also influences mortality rates  indirectly by either accelerating stand development through time or by long-term  alteration of stand structure. These changes in mortality rates derive from the  differential fertilization response across size classes within a stand. The changes in  ___________________  1Albert R.

These  indirect effects will occur in the normal operation of the mortality submodel of the  Prognosis Model (at least in the Inland Empire variant). Whether their magnitude is  correct remains to be evaluated.  Although use is limited to nitrogen fertilization at this time, procedures for directing  the simulation have been structured to facilitate extending its scope to applications of  phosphorus and potassium at varying rates when response results become  available.  CONTROLLING PROGRAM EXECUTION  Simulation of fertilizer effects is invoked by adding one keyword-record to the  sequence of Prognosis keywords controlling other management actions in the  simulation scenario (Wykoff 1986; Wykoff and others 1982). This keyword contains the  characters ‘FERTILIZ” in the first eight columns followed by five fields of parameters  in columns 11-20, . . ., 51-60:  FERTILIZ field 1: Year in which fertilization treatment is to be applied; if  blank, it will be applied at the start of the projection.  field 2: Level of nitrogen to be applied; currently, only treatments  with 200 lb/acre can be represented; if blank, 200 lb/acre  nitrogen fertilization will be applied.  field 3: Level of phosphorus to be applied; currently treatments with  phosphorus are not represented. This value will be ignored.  field 4: Level of potassium to be applied; currently, treatments with  potassium are not represented. This value will be ignored.  field 5: Efficiency parameter specific to this fertilization application.  This parameter is intended to represent the “fall-down”  between results from research plots and the response  expected from application at an operational scale. Default =  1.0.  To illustrate the use of this keyword, figure 1 lists a set of keywords for simulating  the development of a Douglas-fir plantation on a Thuja/Clintonia habitat type. Figure  2 shows three treatments compared to a no-treatment alternative:  1. Fertilization at age 70 (date = 2060) invoked by adding the FERTILIZ keyword,  2. Thinning at age 40 (date = 2030) invoked by the THINBBA keyword, and  3. Both thinning as in 2 followed by fertilization as in 1.  DATA SOURCE  Version 1.0 of the Fertilization Model is calibrated using experimental treatments of 91 plots  clustered at 13 locations in northern Idaho. These locations include Abies grandis/Pachistima  myrsinites and Thuja pticata/Pachistima myrsinites (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968)  habitat types. Two conifer species are represented: Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and  grand fir (Abies grandis). The model quantifies the change produced by nitrogen fertilization  (200 lb of actual N in 440 lb of urea per acre) on diameter and height growth of individual trees.  Observations spanned a period of 14 years after treatment.  The model is based on Shafii’s (1988) analyses of these and several related sets of data.  The latter data sets were used for evaluation of model behavior.  Use of the current version of the fertilization model is most defensible under conditions  similar to those outlined above. The computer program, however, is designed to simplify revision  when new fertilization results are available. Whenever data are outside the range of the  calibration data, warning messages are printed advising that results should be used with  caution. Nevertheless, the model continues processing the data, assuming valid application.  3  Keyword record  Reference  line  Keyword Field 1 Field 2 Field 3 Field 4 Field 5 Field 6 Field 7  1 NOTREES  2 NUMCYCLE 15  3 RANNSEED 3493.  4 INVYEAR 1990  5 NOTREES  6 FERTEST  7 ESTAB 1990  8 PLANT 1993 3. 600.  9 END  10 MGMTID  11 F&TH  12 SPECPREF 2030. 3. -2.  13 THINBBA 2030. 60. .9  14 FERTILIZ 2060.  15 STDINFO 116.0 530.0 45.0 10.0 33.0  16 PROCESS  17 STOP  Line 1: Projection starts with “bare ground.”  Line 2: Run Projection for 15 cycles.

HOW THE MODEL WORKS  Response to fertilization is composed of two effects: direct and indirect. Direct effects include  changes in physiological efficiency that produce changes in the physical structure of the tree-needle  length, crown development, and increased radial and height increment. In addition, there  are indirect effects because growth is a deviation-amplifying process. A bigger tree can produce  more growth than a smaller tree of the same physiological efficiency. And because tree sizes  have been changed, internal stand dynamics also alter the competitive status of the individual  trees. In models such as the Prognosis Model, which are built according to growth architecture  rather than yield architecture (Farnham and others 1986), indirect effects are represented by  the basic model once the direct effects have subsided.  The diameter response model is based on Shafii’s (1988) analyses of responses, with some  reanalysis to take advantage of improvements in the formulation of the Prognosis diameter  growth function (Wykoff in press). Of the several response periods reported by Shafii and others  (in press), the 10-year period was selected because although direct effects seemed to have  subsided by about 6 to 8 years after treatment, indirect effects would not be represented by the  main Prognosis Model until the end of the projection cycle, which is normally 10 years. Shafii  modified the basic Prognosis Model equation for individual tree basal area growth (Wykoff 1986)  to introduce a treatment effect on values of the coefficients in the equation. The basic model is  linear in the coefficients with a logarithmic transformation of the dependent variable. Therefore,  the logarithm of the response ratio CR&gt; for basal area growth is the difference between the  expression for untreated trees and the expression with coefficients modified by the treatment  effect. Variables in the expression that do not interact with treatment sum to zero in the  difference and need not be considered. Remaining variables that interact with the fertilization  treatment are tree diameter and overstory competition.  5  Table 1—Effect of tree diameter and stand basal area  on response to 200 lb/acre nitrogen fertiliza-tion  (ratio response of basal area increment  per tree)  D.b.h.  Basal area larger trees  50 ft2 150ft2  Inches  6 1.32 1.54  10 1.37 1.56  The resulting equation is:  In(R) = 0.1108 ln(DBH) +0.003004 BAL/ln(DBH+l)  where:  DBH = breast high diameter (inches)  BAL = basal area in trees larger than the subject tree (ft2).  Hence, the relative response is greater in dense stands than in more open stands  (table 1 and figure 3). These coefficients suggest that dominant trees are better  competitors for the nitrogen naturally available in the site and that nitrogen is more  limiting in denser stands. Note, however, that direction of the response depends on the  scale of measurement. Whereas these results are reported on a relative scale (percent  response), Shafii showed that absolute growth responses on a scale of basal area  increment were in just the opposite direction.  The derivation of the diameter response ratio was based on an equation roughly  similar to that used in the Prognosis Model for trees larger than 5 inches d.b.h. In the  fertilization subroutine, however, the same equation for relative response is applied to  trees less than 5 inches as well, but with a maximum response ratio of 2.68, which is  the value for a 3-inch tree with 400 ft2 of competition in larger trees. This truncation  generates the small, flat triangular plateau in the upper right of figure 3.  Figure 3—Response ratio for basal area increment depends on tree diameter and basal  area in trees larger than the subject tree.  6  Although diameter increment data were available for 10 years after treatment, the  height measurements covered only 6 years. The ratio of height increment (feet) of  fertilized trees to increment of the nonfertilized trees was 8.58/7.38 = 1.163 or a 16  percent response. Because other stand attributes did not affect the percentage height  response, the simple ratio suffices.  Shafii’s analyses of gross and net basal area response of the total stand showed that  response peaked at about 6 years. Starting between 8 and 10 years, there was no  further response to the end of the ll-year study. Unfortunately, measurement error of  diameter increment for short time intervals is so large in comparison to the treatment  response that analysis of the yearly distribution of response at the individual tree level  did not appear fruitful. Therefore, we chose to calculate the total response for 10 years.  Fortunately, the 10-year duration of response coincides with the length of the  projection cycles most commonly used when running the Prognosis Model. If the  projection cycles are less than 10 years, however, or if the fertilization activity is  scheduled for less than 10 years before the next cycle boundary, then the results will  be somewhat biased relative to the data used for calibration.  The model applies the calculated ratio to the mean annual change in diameter-squared  for a period of 10 years or for the length of the current projection cycle,  whichever is shorter. If the current cycle is less than 10 years, the remaining years  of fertilizer effect are carried to the next cycle. For that additional period, a new value  of the ratio is calculated using the updated tree diameter and stand basal area.  Hence, there will be a small additional indirect effect in the second (and any subse-quent)  periods within the 10 years of response.  REFERENCES  Daubenmire, R.; Daubenmire, J. B. 1968.

In  practice forest managers may be concerned with inconsistent  growth and yield estimates from models of different resolution  levels, each used for a specific set of decisions, or be forced  to sacrifice efficiency and flexibility by using a single model  for all projections. A number of researchers have attempted to  unify modeling approaches or link whole stand models and  size-class models or individual tree models. Two general  approaches have been developed: (i) aggregating diameter  distribution or individual tree characters to stand yield  estimates (e.g. Daniels, 1981; Daniels and Burkhart, 1988; Strub  and Burkhart, 1975), and (ii) disaggregating overall stand  attributes into more detailed models such as individual tree  models and/or size-class models (e.g. Burk and Newberry, 1984;  Dahms, 1983; Harrison and Daniels, 1987; Knoebel et al., 1986;  smith and Brand, 1987). The disaggregation approach has the  o  advantage that volumes at all levels are conditioned on whole  stand volume which is mathematically more tractable than  size-class or individual tree volumes (Burkhart, 1987).  However, most classical approaches are based on the  assumption that the distribution of tree sizes in a stand can be  adequately characterized by a probability density function (pdf) •  ··~&lt;""i .QltA..bi.P...W..t « . . ;;;;;;;#...m:;:;;:; !! .1:;.3....).:/0 c; (,. $@O, .f  3  Some pdf's, such as Weibull, have been applied only because they  are flexible enough to fit a relatively broad spectrum of  distribution shapes and are easily integrated, not because they  are based on any biological principles. Additionally, after the  parameters of a pdf have been estimated, it is difficult to  incorporate the influences and changes in stand density and/or  structure due to silvicultural treatments.  Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a new  approach to disaggregate stand volume growth to a list of  individual trees. This disaggregation function, relative size­growth  (RSG) function, is based on general concepts about  competition among individual trees and dynamics of stand  structure, without assuming that the distribution of tree size  follows any particular probability density function.  BACKGROUND  The frequency distribution of plant weight is the link  between the individual and the popUlation biomass (Hozumi et al.,  1968). Many authors have studied the relationships between the  o frequency distribution of plant size and competitive interactions  for many plant species inclUding trees. Skewness is commonly  found in stem size distributions of even-aged monocultures (Bliss  and Reinker, 1964; Ford, 1975; Ford and Newbould, 1970; Gates,  1982; Harper, 1967; Koyama and Kira, 1956; west and Borough,  1983). Mohler et ale (1978) found that maximum positive skewness  4  occurs at the time self-thinning begins.  Hara (1984a, 1984b) and Kohyama and Hara (1989) proposed a  stochastic model to investigate the dynamics of stand structure.  The model describes the changes in size distribution with time as  a function of mean growth rate, variance of growth rate, and  mortality. The mean growth rate and variance of growth rate can  be expressed as quadratic functions of plant size. They found  that plant height, stem diameter, and individual plant weight  each have specific size-dependent growth patterns.  Westoby (1982, 1984) introduced the concept of a  distribution modifying function (DMF). The DMF represents the  growth at a point in time of all individuals alive in a  population. He proposed a polynomial equation to describe DMF in  which plant size increment is a dependent variable and plant size  is an independent variable. The dynamics of a stand can be  delineated by a series of DMFs, and the shapes of DMF determine  changes in the shape of the frequency distribution of plant size  (Figure 1). Westoby (1984) also pointed out that most DMFs are of  the quadratic form, which produce skewed frequency distributions  of plant size. The above relationship can be related to the  dynamics of an even-aged, single species stand illustrated by  Long and Smith (1984). The concepts and ideas introduced by Hara  (1984a, 1984b) and Westoby (1982, 1984) were used in this study  as the basis of formulating the disaggregation function.  5  DATA AND ANALYSXS METHODS  X. Da~a Base for Hodel DevelopmeD~  Data used in this study represent single species, second­qrowth,  managed, even-aged Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuqa menziesii  var. qlauca (Beissn) Franco) stands (&gt; 65% Douglas-fir by basal  area) in the inland Northwest of the united states. The data were  collected from 107 installations (sites) which were primarily  established for thinning and fertilization experiments throughout  six geographic regions (northern Idaho, western Montana, central  Idaho, northeast Oregon, central Washington, and northeast  Washington). A total of 206 control and/or thinning plots were  utilized from four sources: the University of Idaho·s  McIntire-Stennis stUdy, Intensive Timber CUlture (a cooperative  stUdy between the University of Idaho and the Forest Service,  USDA, Intermountain Forest and Range Experiment Station),  Potlatch corporation, and the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition  cooperative (IFTNC). Plot size ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 acre. No  fertilized plots were used in the analysis. All trees were  measured for both height (to the nearest 1 foot) and diameter (to  the nearest 0.01 inch) at various qrowth periods (from 4 years to  14 years). Tree volume was calculated using the individual tree  cubic foot volume equation for Douglas-fir in the Stand Prognosis  Model (Wykoff et al., 1982).

Some stands were thinned mechanically,  and others were thinned from above and below to various residual  densities.  Since ninety percent of the data had a common growth period  of six years, six years was used for data analysis and model  development. All data sets were converted to this specific growth  period, e.g. a 14-year period was divided into two 6-year periods  (year 0 to year 6 and year 8 to year 14), if the measurements at  year 8 were available, resulting in the addition of 12 growth  periods to the data base. Some mensurational attributes of the  218 Douglas-fir plots at the beginning of the 6-year growth  period are summarized in Table 1.  II. ADalysis Methods  Ordinary least squares regression was utilized to estimate  the parameters for linear models. Residual analysis and  mUlticollinearity diagnostics (e.g. variance inflation factors  (VIF» were conducted to examine the adequacy of the models and  to test for violations of statistical assumptions. For nonlinear  models, nonlinear least squares regression was employed for  parameter estimation. Residual analysis was conducted to detect  model under-specification, departure from statistical  assumptions, and existence of suspect data points. In addition,  local minimum problems were checked by using different starting  values for parameter estimates to ensure correct convergence.  7  KODEL DEVELOPMENT  x. Definition of The Relative Size-Growth Function  We assume that overall development of even-aged stands  follows a self-thinning process mathematically described by the  -3/2 power ""lawtl. The dynamics of stand structure is affected by  competitive interactions among individuals. Further, the growth  of an individual tree is size-dependent. The contribution of an  individual tree's growth to stand total growth is proportional to  that tree's relative size in the stand. Relative tree growth  (RTG) is defined as the ratio of individual tree volume growth to  stand total volume growth (i.e. the sum of the individual trees)  on a unit area. Relative tree size (RTS) is defined as the ratio  of individual tree volume to stand total volume on a unit area.  Relative tree growth is expressed as a function of relative tree  size. The following general quadratic function was used to  describe the relative size-growth (RSG) relationship:  RTG= Po + P1 *RTS+ P2 *RTS2  I  (1)  where ~o' Pl' and ~2 are coefficients to be estimated for each  plot.  xx. Characteristics of The Relative Size-Growth Function  The relative size-growth (RSG) function (equation (1» was  8  fit to 6-year growth data from each of 218 Douglas-fir plot  observations using ordinary least squares regression. The three  coefficients, ~o, ~1' and ~2' and associated statistics of the  regression models, such as coefficient of determination (R2),  were used to characterize the RSG function.  The regression analysis showed a strong relationship between  initial relative tree size and SUbsequent relative tree growth.  Most plot regressions (93%) produced R2 larger than 0.60. Sixty­three  percent of the 218 regressions had R2 larger than 0.80.  Since the RSG function is a quadratic equation, the signs and  magnitudes of the coefficients of the function determine the  degrees and shapes of curvature. The constant coefficient ~o  represents the level of the curve. The linear coefficient ~1  delineates the rate of change, either positive or negative  depending on the sign of ~1. The quadratic coefficient ~2  reflects the shape of the curve. A positive ~2 indicates that the  curve is convex and a negative ~2 defines a concave curve. The  slopes of the RSG function were always positive since all the  linear coefficients ~1 had positive values. Sixty-seven percent  of the 218 RSG functions had quadratic coefficients ~2 not  significantly different than zero (a=0.05). This indicates that  the relationship between RTG and RTS is usually linear. Of the  seventy-two RSG functions (33%) with estimates of ~2  significantly different from zero, twelve plots had a positive ~2  producing convex curves and sixty plots had a negative ~2  representing a concave relationship.  9  Pearson's correlation coefficients between pairs of the  three parameters were -0.90 (Ro versus R1), 0.63 (Ro versus R2  ),  and -0.88 (R1 versus R2 ). Generally, when R1 equals one, both Ro  and R2 are nearly equal to zero resulting in a straight line  through the origin. When the linear coefficient Rl is less than  one, both Ro and R2  are positive producing a convex curve with a  positive intercept. In contrast, when R1 is larger than one, both  Ro and R2 have negative values which produce a concave curve with  a negative intercept (Figures 2(a), (b), and (c». ThUS, three  basic shapes for the RSG function exist: linear, convex, and  concave. According to Westoby (1982, 1984), three basic DMF  functions determine the frequency distribution of plant size to  be normal, positively and negatively skewed, respectively.  III. Prediction Models for the Coefficients of The Relative  size-Growth Function  The relationship among Ro, R1  and R2  of the relative size­growth  (RSG) function implies that the linear coefficient R1  plays the most important role among the three coefficients. When  R1  is determined, the curvature and level of the RSG function are  then defined. Therefore, a recursive system of equations was  developed for predicting the three coefficients of the RSG  function as functions of initial stand variables. Since within­stand  distribution of tree growth can be influenced by the stage  of stand development, stand density and structure (Pienaar and  10  Harrison, 1984; stage, 1969), prediction models for ~o, ~l and Pz  of the RSG function can be developed accordingly as follows:  (1). Stand density affects the rate and variability of tree  growth and consequently the dYnamics of stand structure.  (2). Mean tree size is an expression of the growth stages  of even-aged stand development. The interaction of mean tree size  and surviving number of trees in a stand can be expressed as a  measure of relative stand density which influences the  relationship between tree volume growth and tree volume.  (3). Common statistics used to describe a frequency  distribution are the mean, standard deviation, and skewness.  Ecological studies showed that coefficient of variation is also a  useful measure of inequality of plant population or ""size  hierarchy"", which provides a robust indicator of density effects  on growth and traces the effects of size-selective mortality  (Bendel et al., 1989; Knox and Peet, 1989).  Several stand variables and the first four moments of the  tree volume distribution were evaluated as predictors. Number of  trees (N), quadratic mean tree diameter (D) and the coefficient  of variation of tree volume distribution (CV) were found to be  the most statistically significant and biologically meaningful  predictor variables. The recursive system is formulated as  follows:  Pl  = feN, D, CV),  Pz = f(P1 , N, D, CV),  Po = f(P1 , Pz, N, D, CV).  11  Borders (1989) outlined systems of related equations and  suggested that ordinary least squares (OLS) can be used to obtain  parameter estimates if there is no cross-equation correlation  between error components of the system equations. The situation  he described is a recursive system, a special case of  simultaneous equation systems. If the coefficient matrix of the  endogenous variables in the system is triangular and the  variance-covariance matrix of the equations in the system is  diagonal, the simultaneous equation system is called a diagonally  recursive system (Kmenta, 1971) or simple recursive system (Fomby  et al., 1984). In this case, OLS provides an optimal estimating  technique (Johnston, 1972; pindyck and Rubinfeld, 1976; Theil,  1971), and the application of OLS to each of the structural  equations leads to unbiased, consistent and aSYmptotically  efficient estimates (Kmenta, 1971). To confirm that we had a  diagonally recursive system, we applied the Lagrange mUltiplier  test (Judge et al., 1988) to determine that the error components  for the three equations in the system are pairwise uncorrelated.  The variance-covariance matrix of the equations in the system was  estimated using the 6-year Douglas-fir growth data. The Lagrange  mUltiplier statistic was calculated based on the estimated  variance-covariance matrix and equaled 5.16, which was less than  the 5% critical value (7.81) from the X2-distribution with 3  degrees of freedom. Thus, the variance-covariance matrix of the  equations in the recursive system is diagonal. Therefore, each  equation in this simple recursive system is appropriately  12  estimated by the OLS procedures we employed.  (1). Pre4iction m04el for tbe coefficient PI  Nonlinear relationships between the coefficient PI and  three stand variables (N, D, CV) were observed. After evaluating  different nonlinear equation forms in terms of model fitting,  residual analysis and biological interpretation, the following  prediction model for PI resulted:  -O.02C6 .D  Pl = N* (1- e cv ).  The aSYmptotic error of the estimated parameter was  (2)  0.0007967. A slight trend in the residual plot versus the  predicted PI existed. Adding an intercept to the equation (2)  eliminated the trend in the residual plot. However, the estimated  intercept was nearly equal to one, resulting in a predicted PI  always larger than one and consequent poor model behavior.  Therefore, we selected the equation (2) as the prediction model  (2). Pre4iction m04el for tbe coefficient P2  The prediction model for the quadratic coefficient P2 was  developed using the coefficient PI and two stand variables, D and  CV, as independent variables. Number of trees (N) was  statistically nonsignificant in the analysis, unlike the  13  prediction equation for Pl.

HODEL EVALUA'1'ION AND YERIPICA'1'ION  Often model evaluation and verification are performed on  data not used in model fitting process (i.e. independent data).  Although using independent data has several positive aspects, we  chose to test the relative size-growth (RSG) function differently  for three reasons. First, we felt that the amount of data used in  the model fitting process was somewhat limited. Therefore, we  wanted to use all the data for model development. Second,  independent data evaluations are most helpful when selecting  between various model forms. In this situation, an independent  data evaluation might give us some idea of ""real"" error levels  when the model is used for prediction. However, with the limited  data, the resulting error estimates would be questionable. Last,  what we really wanted to show with the evaluation and  verification is how the model responds to various stand and tree  size composition structures. This, we believe, is more important  than testing against independent data for the model.  I. Evaluation of the Relative Size-Growth Function  Eight plots were selected from the Douglas-fir growth data  lS  to illustrate four stand development phases.given two different  stand structures for each density class. The initial stand  attributes, number of trees, quadratic mean diameter, coefficient  of variation of tree volume, and relative density index (Drew and  Flewelling, 1979), for each example plot are provided in Table 2.  The three stand variables were used to predict the  coefficient ~1 of the RSG function using equation (2). Then the  predicted ~1 and observed stand variables were input into  equation (3) to predict the coefficient ~2. Finally the  coefficient ~o was obtained by equation (4) using the predicted  ~1' ~2 and observed three stand variables. The predicted  coefficients of the RSG function are given in Table 3 with  corresponding coefficients estimated from regressions fit to  actual Douglas-fir growth data. The behavior of the predicted RSG  function was compared with that of the regression models, as well  as a plot of observed data for each plot.  Two low density stands are illustrated in Figure 3. Plot  50-3 is a uniform stand with little variation in tree size and  represents plantation conditions (Figure 3(a». Before crown  closure « 0.15 relative density according to Drew and Flewelling  (1979» the trees are growing as a collection of individuals  without inter-tree competition. The observed and predicted RSG  function reflect this condition as a line with little slope, i.e.  all trees contribute about the same relative growth. Plot 257-6  (Figure 3(b» is also a low density stand prior to crown closure.  However, this plot shows more variation in tree size primarily  16  due to the presence of one much larger individual, likely part of  an older residual age class. The observed RSG relationship is  linear and each tree1s relative growth is approximately  proportional to its initial relative size. The predicted RSG  function is non-linear indicating that the very large individual  would attain growth more than proportional to its relative size.  It is noteworthy that most of the uncommon large disagreements  between observed and predicted RSG functions occurred in this  type of situation with a few much larger residual trees in a  stand. There was no particular bias apparent for these larger  trees (i.e. on the average the predictions agreed with the  observed) but the variation was high. Actual large trees grew  more or less efficiently, as expressed by the RTG/RTS ratio, than  smaller trees, with the shape and curvature of the actual RSG  function depending on plot specific conditions such as age,  species and condition of the large residual trees. This type of  variation in stand dynamics is not completely accounted for given  the level of detail in our current modeling approach. However, it  appears that this approach has promise for modeling multi-storied  or uneven-aged conditions.  Relative size-growth relationships for two stands with  relative densities just past crown closure are shown in Figure 4.  Plot 250-5 (Figure 4(a» is a uniform stand. Both the observed  and predicted relationship is linear with a steeper slope than  for open-grown stands (Plot 50-3 in Figure 3(a». Each tree1s  relative growth is nearly proportional to its relative size (the  17  .slope is about one) suggesting that inter-tree competition and  crown differentiation has begun. Plot 224-4 is about the same  density as 250-5 but has more variation in tree size (Figure  4(b», again primarily due to one much larger individual (17% of  the initial total volume in this one tree). The result for this  plot is similar to that illustrated in Figure 3(b). The predicted  RSG function is more non-linear than the observed.  Two stands of moderate density are shown in Figure 5. The  RSG relationship is linear for plot 262-3 (Figure 5(a», and the  predicted and fitted curves are nearly coincident. Crown  differentiation, but not substantial density dependent mortality,  has begun in this stand and the slope of the RSG function is  steeper than for lower relative densities. Plot 13-6 (Figure  5(b» has large variation in tree size, again due to a few larger  individuals. The RSG relationship, given higher density than the  previous plots, is predicted to be linear even with high  variation in tree size. The observed RSG function shows that the  largest trees were growing less efficiently than the smaller  trees. For example, the largest tree comprised about 14.5 percent  of the initial volume but contributed only about 9 percent to  growth.  Two high density plots near the assumed lower limit of the  self-thinning zone are shown in Figure 6. The RSG relationships  remain nearly linear for both stands and the observed and  predicted relationships are almost identical. The relative  variation (CV) in tree sizes for these plots were larger than  18  average, typically high density stands had higher CVs.  overall, the predicted RSG functions match the observed  patterns of within-stand growth well. In addition, RSG function  behavior conforms to findings and observations about density  effects on stand growth dynamics by Hara (1984a, 1984b), Westoby  (1982, 1984), and Drew and Flewelling (1979). Our results also  suggest that stand structure affects growth distribution within a  stand in addition to density effects. This was particularly true  in low density stands where unusually large trees often attained  proportionally even more growth than their initial relative size  would indicate.  In summary, increasing stand density and mean tree size  results in the RSG function changing from convex to straight,  then to concave. Larger CV reduces the value of the predicted Pl  (steepness of the curve), but increases the value of the  predicted Pz (degree of curvature). Different stand structure,  density and tree size impact the shape of the RSG function,  consequently, influence relative tree growth within the stand. If  the RSG function is linear, the relative growth of individual  trees is proportional to their relative sizes. If the RSG  function is a convex curve, larger trees in the stand have larger  relative growth than smaller trees. In contrast, if the RSG  function is concave, smaller trees are more efficient than larger  trees.  19  II. Verifica~ion of the Relative Size-Growth Function  Six plots with a 6-year growth period from year 2 to year 8  were selected from the Douglas-fir growth data to verify the  behavior of the RSG function. These six plots comprised partially  independent data because the growth period (from year 2 to year  8) was not directly used in model fitting process, thus providing  a set of initial conditions somewhat different than those used in  model development. Stand variables at year 2 of the six plots are  shown in Table 4. These plots were selected to cover a relatively  broad range of stand conditions, e.g. stand density ranged from  260 to 1420 trees per acre, quadratic mean tree diameter from 4.4  to 10.7 inches, and stand total volume from 1447 to 6825 cubic  feet per acre. Three of the plots (i.e. plots 13-4, 13-8, and 30­4)  had been thinned at year 0, the rest were unthinned (i.e.  plots 13-2, 13-6 and 30-6).  The stand variables at year 2 were input into equations (2),  (3), and (4) to predict the three parameters of the RSG function  for each plot. Relative tree growth (RTG) was calculated for each  alive tree during the 6-year growth period according to its  relative tree size (RTS), applying the plot-specific RSG  function. Predicted tree volume growth was obtained by  multiplying the actually observed 6-year stand volume growth of  each plot by each tree's RTG. Predicted 6-year tree volume growth  was compared with the corresponding observed 6-year tree volume  growth. Prediction error was defined as the difference between  20  observation and prediction. Positive values of error are under­prediction  and negative values over-prediction.  Prediction errors for the 6-year volume growth were  calculated for each tree and then averaged for each plot. Since  the distributions of the observed tree volume growth and  prediction error for some plots were asymmetric, median  prediction error may be a better measure for central tendency.  Table 5 shows the means and medians of the observed 6-year volume  growth and prediction error for the six plots. Overall mean and  median were also calculated over the six plots. The results  indicated that across all six plots, the RSG function over­predicted  tree volume growth by 0.0235 cubic feet, which was  about 1.1% of the observed mean tree volume growth in 6 years  (2.20 cubic feet). If median terms were used, the RSG function  over-predicted tree volume growth by 0.16 cubic feet (8.8% of the  observed median tree volume growth).  The performance of the RSG function across diameter classes  within a stand was also examined. For each of the six plots, the  predicted and observed 6-year volume growth of individual trees  were categorized into 2-inch diameter classes for initial tree  DBH. A cumulative frequency distribution of the predicted tree  volume growth was plotted and compared with that for the observed  tree volume growth (Figure 7). For most plots the distributions  of the predicted volume growth are nearly identical to the  distributions of the observed tree volume growth in both levels  and shapes which varies from near linear to sigmoid. For plot 13-  21  6 (Figure 7(c», the RSG function over-predicts tree volume  growth for small diameter classes, but under-predicts tree volume  growth for diameter classes larger than 6 inches even though the  overall curve shapes are similar. The reason may be that this  plot has a number of small trees and large variation in tree size  (CV is 190), due to a few larger individuals. This stand is  approaching a storied condition, a situation that is relatively  uncommon in the development data. The similarities in shapes  between the observed and predicted volume growth distributions  indicated that the RSG function reasonably represents the  different patterns of within-stand volume growth across diameter  classes.  CONCLUSIONS  The relative size-growth (RSG) function developed in this  study provides a biologically meaningful way to represent stand  dynamics and development. The characteristic shape of the RSG  function is determined by initial stand density, mean tree size  and stand structure and describes the distribution of tree growth  within a stand. Therefore, the RSG function can be used as a link  between a whole-stand model and individual tree model. Stand  volume growth predicted from a whole-stand model can be  distributed among a list of individual trees if the tree list is  available as input (Zhang, 1990). ThUS, consistent growth and  yield estimates can be obtained at whole-stand or individual tree  22  levels as desired to fulfill different decision making. Further,  this disaggregation approach should also apply to other stand  attributes (such as stand basal area growth), other tree species  and/or geographic areas, and with appropriate modifications may  apply to more complex stand structures.  silvicultural interventions, such as thinning, directly  alter the variables used for predicting the coefficients of the  RSG function. Further, the RSG function performed equally well  for thinned and unthinned stands. Therefore, we feel that the  disaggregation function should reasonably represent the effects  of density management manipulations on stand dynamics.  LITERATURE CITED  Bendel, R. B., S. S.

"Fertilization Response by Interior Forests: When, Where, and How Much?","Mika, P.G.; Moore, J.A.; Brockley, R.P.; Powers, R.F.","Interest in tree nutrition and the use of fertilizers in forests of the interior West has grown over the last 20 years. Large-scale fertilizer trials have been established to estimate growth response for Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine. Current research focuses on where and why fertilizer response is obtained and how fertilization interacts with other forest management activities. Nitrogen is the major growth-limiting nutrient in these forests. For Douglas-fir, gross volume growth responses to 224 kg N /ha may average up to 25% during the first six years following fertilization. Similar treatments in ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine have produced a 30% volume response in five and six years, respectively. Response has been shown to vary across parent materials and soil types; it is usually less on sites with high levels of mineralizable nitrogen in the soil, high foliar nitrogen concentrations, or high site index. Good response to nitrogen fertilization has been linked to vegetation control in very young stands and to stocking control in older stands. Nitrogen fertilization may increase mortality rates and the incidence of pest problems. While other nutrients usually do not produce a significant growth response when applied singly, response to nitrogen may be limited by natural or induced deficiencies of other nutrients. Lack of sulfur, boron, or copper can reduce growth response to nitrogen in lodgepole pine; low potassium levels may have a similar effect in Douglas-fir; and addition of other nutrients, primarily sulfur, has increased response to nitrogen in ponderosa pine.",1992,yes,,"Mika, P.G., J.A.

Those of the  nonstomatal region were all taken on the abaxial surface  halfway between the two stomatal regions. Some exper-imental  and control needles were treated with chloroform  to dissolve the epicuticular wax before cryo-SEM prep-aration.  Wax quantification-One set of 134 to 3 19 experi-mental  and control needles was used from each of the  four installations. To extract the epicuticular wax, each  needle was held by the petiole with a pair of forceps and  immersed for 10 sec in successive 30-ml portions of chlo-roform.  The chloroform extracts from each needle sample  were filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter papers and  then combined. Chloroform was removed from the sam-ple  by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (water  aspirator) at 40 C. The residues remaining after removal  of the chloroform were dissolved in 6 ml chloroform, and  then transferred to preweighed aluminum weighing boats  (WJ. After drying to a constant weight in a desiccator,  the final weight (WJ was determined. The amount of  epicuticular wax was the difference between W, and W,  minus the weight of dry residue of the same amount of  chloroform. Data were calculated and expressed as mean  k standard error.  The wax types, tubular or scalelike, were evaluated from  four sets of cryo-SEM micrographs of experimental and  control needles. The needle areas covered by tubular and  scalelike wax were calculated by measuring cutouts of  photographs with a Li-Cor 3000 portable area meter.  Needle surface area and dry weight-After extraction  of epicuticular wax, each needle was cut with a razor blade  through the plane that separates the needle as a distal cone  and a proximal frustum (Fig. 1). The lengths of the distal  cone (LJ and the proximal frustum (L,) were precisely  measured under the dissecting microscope. The circum-ferences  of the bottom of the distal cone (PJ and the  middle of the proximal frustum (P,) were traced with a  Nikon SMZ-10 dissecting microscope attached to the  camera lucida, digitized by the DAP computer program,  and calculated to obtain the perimeter by J. A. Elhai's  DNALENGTH program (unpublished), which is a per-sonal  computer software routine to accumulate the length  between two digitized points. The total needle surface  area was the sum of the surface areas of the distal cone  and the proximal frustum, as calculated by equations  90 73  35.8 23.2  573 593  30 Sept 87 16 Nov 87  12 Sept 88 8 Nov 88  shown in Fig. I. Needle dry weight was determined after  drying to a constant weight in a 100 C oven.  RESULTS  The entire surface of experimental needles tended to  be more glaucous than control needles. When experi-mental  leaves were dipped in chloroform, they lost their  glaucous appearance. Upon chloroform treatment, con-trol  leaves lost the glaucous strips that were macroscop-ically  visible in the stomatal regions.  The epicuticular waxes of nonstomatal regions of ex-perimental  needles appeared with cryo-SEM to have an  ornate, tubular structure. This was especially true in the  valleys between the ridges (Figs. 2, 3). Examined by free-hand  sections, the valleys between the ridges correspond-ed  to the radial anticlinal walls of epidermal cells. When  the epicuticular waxes of experimental needles were dis-solved  by chloroform, a relatively smooth and clear sur-face  topography (Fig. 4) corresponded to files of epidermal  cells beneath the cuticle.

The mean quantity of surface wax per unit needle area  was 3.66 + 1.22 yg/mm2 for the experimental needles  and 4.39 + 1.13 yg/mm2 for the controls. The amount  of surface wax per needle was 0.158 k 0.0 19 mg in the  experimentals and 0.160 + 0.038 mg in the controls. The  experimental needles had about 16.6% less wax per sur-face  area and about 1.3% less total wax per needle than  the controls. However, based on the analysis of variance  (ANOVA), the mean weight ofthe wax, whether expressed  per surface area or per needle, was not significantly dif-ferent  between the experimental and control needles. The  experimental needles (dry weight per needle = 3.93 k  0.72 mg) were about 35.8% heavier than the controls  (=2.89 + 0.27 mg), except those from installation 237  located in western Montana. The Fvalue of ANOVA for  the mean needle dry weight is 1.825 (P = 0.225). Long-term  growth records (8 yr) showed that unlike the other  sites, stem wood growth of trees from installation 237  had not responded to fertilization.  DISCUSSION  Our results demonstrated that glaucousness is caused  by an ornate, crystalline wax morphology. In the nonsto-matal  regions glaucous (experimental) needles had much  more tubular wax than did nonglaucous (control) needles.  Experimental and control needles were similarly glaucous  in the stomatal regions, where the wax was tubular. Re-moving  wax with chloroform eliminated the glaucous ap-pearance  in each case. Fertilization did not result in the  production of greater quantities of epicuticular wax, but  rather in a change in wax morphology.  Glaucousness appears to be due to the production of  greater quantities of tubular wax and lesser quantities of  scalelike wax. The chemical nature and metabolic path-ways  for the production of these two wax types need to  be determined. In Pinus radiata D. Don there is evidence  that chemically different waxes were produced in stomatal  and nonstomatal regions (Franich and Wells, 1980). It is  possible that the different regions produce wax from dif-ferent  monomers or by changes in concentration and crys-tallization  during growth. In vitro recrystallizations of  epicuticular wax of P. menziesii suggested that the final  dimensions and morphology ofthe wax crystals were func-tions  of physical properties of the component molecules,  rather than an enzyme-dependent polymerization (Lister  and Thair, 1981). The method of epicuticular wax de-position  remains unclear, but possible hypotheses include  1) an extrusion process through pores in the cuticle; 2)  diffusion of wax components in a solvent system through  cuticle, followed by crystallization on the leaf surface; or  3) transport of the wax components by a carrier (Mc-  Whorter and Paul, 1989).  In Piceapungens Engelm. (Reicosky and Hanover, 1976)  and Pinus strobus L. (Johnson and Riding, 189 I), tubular  wax of the stomatal region is developed before needles  emerge from the bud; in contrast, the epicuticular wax of  the nonstomatal region develops later. However, Thijsse  and Baas (1990) reported that the epicuticular wax on  both stomatal and nonstomatal regions develops before  bud break in P. menziesii.  Barthlott (1 98 1) claimed that epidermal characters were  only slightly affected by environmental conditions, and  that great structural diversity of epidermal cells provided  valuable systematic criteria. Our results revealed that most  epidermal characters on both treatment and control leaves  were similar. However, glaucousness may not always be  a good taxonomic character because, at least in P. men-ziesii,  it is strongly influenced by mineral nutrition.  Whether the production of glaucous needles by P. men-ziesii  in response to fertilization is an adaptative response  is unknown at this time. The effect of enhanced glau-cousness  of leaves is to reduce the intensity of the UV  waveband of light. This may be advantageous especially  for high elevation species where UV radiation can cause  ""sunscald"" on nonglaucous leaves (Clark and Lister, 1975).  In addition to reducing excess absorption of radiation,  the projections of tubular waxes could also result in a  greater boundary layer for transpiration and energy ex-change  with the surrounding cooler air (Barthlott and  Wollenweber, 198 1). In addition, the surface ""roughness""  may cause turbulence in laminar air flow and therefore  increase thermodynamic exchange. Barthlott (1 98 1) re-ported  that woody species in moist tropical or subtropical  environments often have little or no surface sculpturing.  In contrast, plants growing under dry conditions normally  have a greater surface sculpturing than those plants not  living under water or temperature stress. Lastly, the sculp-turing  of epicuticular waxes increases the repellency of  water and hydrophilic liquids. Wettable leaf surfaces, ow-ing  to the existence of the surface water film, tend to  contain pollutants and are often highly colonized by mi-croorganisms.  In contrast, in water-repellent leaves it is  usually quite hard to find any trace of contamination  (Barthlott and Wollenweber, 198 1).  In conclusion, our study shows that fertilization with  potassium and nitrogen results in enhanced glaucousness  in the nonstomatal areas of needles. Glaucousness is caused  by a highly ornate tubular wax morphology and is not  related to the total quantity of surface wax. The chemistry  and metabolic pathways resulting in the different wax  morphologies remain unclear.  LITERATURE CITED  BAKER, E. A. 1982. Chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular  waxes. In D.

Other elements may be limiting but not as com­monly as these two. Forest fertilization can alleviate these deficiencies resulting in trees that should be more resistant to insects and diseases. Recent results sug­gest that it may be possible to alter tree root chemistry to the detriment of Armillaria ostoyae root rot by manipu­lating tree nutritional status, particularly by using potas­sium fertilization treatments.  IN·rRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of the empirical andexperimentalevidence to datedemonstrating links between tree nutrition and forest health problems such as Armillaria root rot and mountain pine beetle. The evidence for these links comes from Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) results as well as other research from the Inland Northwest region. The tree species included in these examples are Douglas-fir or ponderosa pine. In keeping with the theme ofthis symposium, at leastsome ofthe study sites were on cedar or hemlock habitat types.  EVIDENCE OF LINKS BETWEEN TREE  NUTRITION AND FOREST HEALTH  One important prefacing comment needs to be made, nitrogen  (N)  is good. All trees and sites that we have studied need more  N.  When we apply N fertilizer, we usually get a large positive response (Mika et al. 1992; Moore et al. 1991; Shafii et al. 1989). However, sometimes when we fertilized with only N, mortality rates increased, producing negative response. At times, this mortality conformed exactly to high nitrogen treatment plot boundaries. This ""square death"" pattern occurred in both the Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine IFTNC region-wide experi­ments. Thus, nutrients have an important influence on mortality processes as well as tree growth.  IFTNC members wanted to know why this mortality occurred on some plots but not others. Classifying the study stands based :m pre-treatment foliar samples offered some explanation of the mortality patterns (Mika and Moore 1990). Using literature recommendations for optimal potassium (K) and balance with N (KIN), we grouped the stands into three categories representing poor, good, and other K conditions. There was significant difference in response to N fertilization for stands in the ""poor"" foliar'K class prior to treatment (Figure 1). Notice that the 200 lbs. N/ac. was a safe treatment for all 3 K classes, even for the poor K class. However, response to the 400 lbs. N/ac. treatment disappears in the poor K class due to the increased mortality. It appears that small changes in nutrient status can result in large changes in both growth and mortality.  200  -as==---150  CU 0100  c:  0  a.  0 CUa:  50  0  N  Treatment: 0200#N/a EJ400#N/a  Poor Good Other  Stand Potassium Status  Figure l.--&lt;i-year net volume response by K status and treatment.  What caused the trees to die? Figure 2 shows that most of the mortality associated with the 400 lbs. N treatment in the poor K class was due to Armillaria root rot in the Douglas-fir or bark beetles killing some of the ponderosa pine component of these plots. The amount of mortality caused by root rot (almost all Armillaria) in the ""good"" K class was noticeably lower than the other two K classes for all three treatments (Figure 2).  4-r-----------------,  Cause of Mortality:  Ed  Root Rot 0 Bark Beetle &'I Other  O...u:..G.J.....J..&lt;:'-~3--L_""'_'_':..d..._=:;:L.JL.o:::...l...J&lt;:..a...J::..:::LJ  N Trell1menl: 0 200 400 0 200 400 0 200 400 K Status: Poor Good Otherwise  Figure 2.-Mortality rates by cause, treatment, and potassium status.  Reprinted from 1994 symposium proceedings of Interior Cedar-Hemlock-White Pine Forests: Ecology and Management, held March 2 -4, 1993 174 Moore, Mika, Schwandt, and Shaw  In Montana, the lFfNC established an experiment testing the effect of Nand N plus K fertilizers on growth and mortality of ponderosapine. Thisexperimentprovidedtheftrstchanceforthe IFfNC to test a combined N plus K treatment at the start of an experiment. After four years there were large mortality differ­ences (net volume) among treatments (Figure 3). The N only (200 Ibs. N/ac.) fertilization had signiftcantly more mortality than the N plus K (200 Ibs. N and 200 Ibs. K1ac.) treatment. Mountainpinebeetleskilleda significantnumber oftreesonthe N only plots, whileon the adjacent N plus K plots not a single tree was killed by beetles in the 4-year period (Figure 4). Potassium added to the fertilizer mix seemed somehow to ""protect"" the ponderosa from the beetles.  . ....  -  ~100  CD  I/)  C  .. ..  8-50 GI  ""  a:  CD  0  E  :::I  ~  ·50  ....  .. _--.. .. .

Ponderosa Pine mortality was related to pretreatment foliar K status. Mortality occurred (the large negative responders) when N alone was added to those sites that had poor KIN balance prior to treatment (Figure 5). However, if both N and K were in the fertilizer, then the tree mortality did not occur, even on those sites with low pre-treatment KIN ratios.  Recent results from Entry et al. (1991) may explain the physiological basis for the IFINC results.

Comparison ofinoculated roots from thinnedplots versus thinned and fertilized (with 200 Ibs. Nlac.) plots showed that incidence of infection was signiftcantly higher on the thinned and fertilized treatment than on the thinned only plots. They found that Armillaria incidence was related to root chemistry. Tree roots from thinned stands contained high concentrations of phenols and low sugar concentrations, while thinned and fertilized tree roots had lower phenols and higher sugar concentrations. The ratio ofphenols to sugars was strongly correlatedto incidence of infection (Figure 6): only trees with ratios less than 15 seem susceptible toArmillaria. Phenolics are plant defense chemicals while sugar is ""good food"" for Armillaria (Wargo et a1. 1980).

Further, there is no significant growth effect from theKonly treatments; however,basedonexisting literature, K would effect tree mortality rather than growth.  -_20-'--------------------' 30..,----------------------, .c  CD i0 20  co""  cC'  &.'0 10  ., ..

Four years after the fertilization treatments were applied root samples were collected using methods similar to Entry et al. (1991).

Root tissue phenolic concentration by fertilizer treatment is shown in Figure 8. There were no significant differences among the treatments, although there is a tendency for the K treatments to have higher phenolic concentrations. However, there was a significant reduction in root sugar concen­trations resulting from all the fertilizer treatments, particularly from the K only treatments, which caused a reduction in root sugar to about one-half that of the controls (Figure 9). The root phenolic:sugar ratios by treatment are provided in Figure 10, these ratios are proportional to Entry et al.'s values shown in Figure 6.

Potassium treatments significantly increased the root phenolic/sugar ratio. Given that a high ratio is bad for the fungus and good for the trees, this experiment demonstrates that it may be possible to change tree root chemistry to the detriment ofArmillaria by manipulating tree nutritional status by fertiliza­tion.

Would you recommend this practice?  Answer: We are not aware of any large scale trials of this fertilization technique in our region, thus our answer is specula­tion. The application at the time of planting would probably not be as effective as applying the treatment later in the for two primary reasons: 1) trees can be shipped from the nursery with a high nutrient ""load"", particularly potassium. This may be more efficient than putting fertilizer in the planting hole; and 2) nutrient demands on a site are greatest sometime after crown closure. For these reasons we would not recommend fertilization at the time of planting without substantial field testing.  Question: Any speculation on the mechanism whereby K works it's magic on sugar/phenol ratio? Going into sap produc­tion rather than available for Armillaria? I thought K was an important component of phenols?  Answer: The textbook ""Potassium in Agriculture"" suggests that K is a mobile regulator of enzyme activity, and is involved inessentiallyallcellularfunctions thatinfluencediseaseseverity and probably exerts its greatest effect on disease through specific metabolic functions such as the shikimic pathway. Potassium is believed to effect carbon allocation from the production of simple carbon compounds to more complex ones such as pheno­lics.  Question: Inlookingat limEntry'Sworkonincidence ofroot rot infection, data also shows somewhat lower infection rate in thinned only trees compared to control. Is this significant? Could competition and vigor and growing space influence phenolic production?  Answer: I think the speculation in your question is probably correct; however, our guess is that root sugar concentrations are more effected than phenolics. High sugar concentrations in the roots or bole probably indicates some physiological problem with the trees. The thinned trees were probably allocating carbon to better ""stuff' than sugar such as lignin and cellulose.  Question: In light of your results, can you speculate on the possible effects of fire suppression on the nutritional status of sites, and thus on the trees growing on those sites and their susceptibility to infection by Annillaria.  Answer: Fire exclusion has had a major effect on the forest nutritional environment. Trees growing in nutrient conditions much different than they were prior to fire exclusion. Since potassiumis""t1olatilizedonly atvery high temperatures compared to other elements, frequent fires probably had the effect of increasing K availability. Thus, fire exclusion may play an important role in the K deficiencies that we currently observe around the Inland Northwest.",North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,,,2016-08-12,2016-08-12,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/877,877,878.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/878.pdf,forestryresearch877

MOORE  Department of Forest Resources, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho 83843 USA  JAMESD. NEWBERRY  Potlatch Corporation, Lewiston, Idaho 83501 USA  Abstract. An approach for estimating asymptotic forest stand yield, basal area, and  tree density (number of stems per unit of area) is proposed. Available forest stand growth  data are used to establish the reciprocal equation of Competition-Density (C-D) effect and  develop equations relating the coefficients of C-D effect to stand top height. Asymptotic  stand yield, basal area, and tree density are derived based on bio-mathematical rationales  and expressed as functions of asymptotic top height. Asymptotic top height can be obtained  for different site qualities and/or habitat types by evaluating a height growth model in the  limit as age approaches infinity. Estimated asymptotes can be utilized to parameterize  sigmoid-shaped growth functions (e.g., Richards growth model) for developing forest growth  and yield models.

For the population we are studying-single species,  even-aged stands-we believe a slope of - 3 / 2 is ap-propriate.  According to logistic growth theory (Shinozaki and  Kira 1956) and the ""law"" of constant final yield (Shi-nozaki  and Kira 196 I), the Competition-Density (C-D)  relationship between mean tree volume (V) and tree  density (N)(number of stems per unit area) can be  expressed by the reciprocal equation of C-D effect:  where:  A=  (1 - e-At)  and (2)  Y,  The coefficients A and B are functions of time (t).When  time equals zero, the coefficient A is zero, while the  coefficient B equals the reciprocal of initial mean tree  volume (LT0). When time approaches infinity, the co-efficient  A equals the reciprocal of the final yield (Y,)  and the coefficient B equals zero. The final yield (Y,)  is hypothesized to be a constant for a given site re-gardless  of density (given density sufficient to attain  sity in logarithmic units (self-thinning), and (c) tree  density over time.  full site occupancy). Importantly, for the GD rela-tionship  (Eq. 1) to hold, all stands must be at the same  age (Hutchings and Budd 198 1).  It should be noted that the reciprocal equation of the  C-D effect is dependent on the logistic growth equation  through the values of the coefficients A and B (Eqs. 2  and 3 respectively). Eq. 1 itself takes the form of a size-density  relationship such as the -3 / 2 power ""law."" At  the limits of stand development, we contend that growth  is not dependent upon density and, therefore, the use  of the logistic model as a basis for Eqs. 2 and 3 is  appropriate.  The coefficients A and B in Eq. 1 are constant for  any stage of stand development, and were originally  described as functions of stand age. Drew and Flew-elling  (1977) used mean stand height as an alternative  scale of biological time and, for groups of stands with  a common mean height, related A and B to that height  as follows:  A=a,.Ha2 and (4)  B = b,.Hb2, (5)  where H is mean stand height, and a,, a,, b,, and b,  are parameters to be estimated.  In this study we used stand top height as a measure  of stand development. Stund top height (TOPH) is de-fined  as a mean height of the largest (in terms of di-ameter)  100 stems per hectare, or the average height  November 1993 ESTIMATING ASYMPTOTlC FOREST ATTRIBUTES 745  of all trees when the number of stems per hectare is  &lt;100. The latter occurs only for asymptotic stands.  An advantage of using top height is that both site and  age can be accounted for in one predictor. Further, our  approach relies on the general relationships suggested  by F. Eichhorn (cited by Assmann 1970: 161). Since  stand top height can be modeled as a function of stand  age, site quality, and habitat type (e.g., Monserud 1984),  using top height as the predictor variable offers flexi-bility  by introducing different development patterns  through the shape and level of the height growth curve  for different habitat types. Top height growth can also . -  be evaluated for different stages of stand development.  For example, as stand age goes to infinity, the limit of  top height is considered as asymptotic top height.  When stand top height approaches the asymptote  (TOPH,), final yield (Y,) can be obtained by applying  Eq. 4 to the reciprocal equation of C-D effect as follows:  At this stage of growth, the stand has reached the car-rying  capacity for the species under these site condi-tions.  At this point in our approach, we have translated  identifying an upper asymptote for yield into identi-fying  an upper asymptote for top height. We contend  that this approach is preferable to directly estimating  the final yield from inadequate short-term stand data  for the following reasons: (1) long-term height growth  data are much easier obtained than long-term yield  data; (2) observations close to asymptotic height are . -  more readily obtained than corresponding density ob-servations;  (3) height growth of suitable individuals is  less dependent on density and more reflective of site  differences than are yield data, which are substantially  influenced by density.  The total volume of a stand can be expressed as a  function of basal area, top height, and stand form fac-tor.  In this study, stand form factor (F)is defined as  the ratio of over-bark volume (trunk volume including  the bark) to that of a cylinder with the same basal cross  sectional area (over-bark) and height. Thus, asymptotic  basal area (BA,) can be obtained from the above re-lationship:  BA, =  Y,  (7)  F.TOPH,  When a stand achieves the asymptotic top height  and final yield, the stand moves from a stage where it  is limited by physical constraints (occupation of grow-ing  space) to a situation limited by the carrying capacity  of the site (Hutchings and Budd 198 1). The final yield  as discussed here is an absolute rather than a relative  value. A reasonable assumption is that at this transition  point the relationship between yield and density can  be described mathematically by the -3/2 power ""law""  or self-thinning rule (Yoda et al. 1963, Drew and Flew-elling  1977, Hutchings and Budd 1981):  log(V,) = C - 1.5 .log(N,) (8)  Or  log(Y,) = C - O.S.log(N,), (9)  where V, is asymptotic mean tree volume, Cis a con-stant,  N, is asymptotic tree density (number of stems  per unit area), and Y, = V,.N,. Consequently, the  asymptotic tree density can be calculated given the final  yield by the following equation:  EXAMPLE  Data  Data used in this example represent single-species,  second-growth, even-aged, managed Douglas-fir (Pseu-dotsuga  menziesii var. glauca [Beissn] Franco) stands  in the inland Northwest of the United States. The data  were collected from 21 8 permanent plots (0.04 ha in  size). All trees were measured for both height and di-ameter  for a 6-yr growth period. Tree total volumes  were calculated using regional species-specific volume  equations (Wykoff et al. 1982). Descriptive statistics  for these stands are provided in Table 1. The conditions  represented are moderate density and age, typically not  including observations from asymptotic density situ-ations.  Parameterization of the equations  For any given age or height, the reciprocal equation  of C-D effect (Eq. 1) defines the relationship between  mean tree volume (P"")and tree density (N).The coef-ficientsA  and B can be expressed as functions of stand  top height (TOPH). Consequently, the relationship be-tween  final yield, Y,, and the coefficient A (refer to Eq.  6) can be established. Instead of Eq. 5 we chose to  estimate the coefficient B as a constant. Since final yield  should not be affected by initial stand density condi-tions,  according to the C-D effect, we felt the average  condition (B as a constant) was appropriate. Therefore,  all Douglas-fir plots were fit using the following rela-tionship:  where a,, a,, and b, are parameters to be estimated.  The resulting relationship between the coeficient A and  stand top height was:  A = 2.6082.TOPH-Z2Z45j. (12)  Thus, the final yield Y, in terms of the total volume  per unit area was obtained by applying Eq. 12 to Eq.  6. To satisfy the previously discussed desirable height  746 LIANJUN ZHANG ET AL.

Asymptotic area (BA=) was by Eq'  7, with form factor (F) set to 0.6. For determining stem  form factor, numerous theories and methods have been  discussed in the literature (Gray 1956, Larson 1963,  Newnham 1965, Philip 1983). Metzger's ""d3"" rule de-scribed  the stem as approximating a cubic paraboloid  with a form factor 0.6 (Gray 1956, Larson 1963). Gray's  ""taper line hypothesis"" (1956) claimed that the qua-dratic  paraboloid with a form factor 0.5 satisfied the  mechanical requirements of the stem and fit the stem  profile better than the cubic paraboloid. However,  Gray's definition for form factor was based on under-bark  volume, over-bark sectional area, and height,  which should have a smaller value than that based on  our definition. Further, there is a natural tendency for  form factor to increase with age under stand-grown  conditions, due to a relatively greater decrease in di-ameter  growth than height growth associated with in-creasing  competition (Larson 1963). As trees grow old-er,  we assume that the survivors become better  anchored; thus they would approach the cubic parab-oloid  form factor (0.6) suggested by Gray (1 956) for a  firmly anchored beam of uniform resistance. Recently,  the largest form factor observed for individual coastal  Douglas-fir was 0.6 (Rustagi and Loveless 199 1) and  for individual interior Douglas-fir trees was 0.63 (Mathis  and Rustagi 199 1). Thus, we assume that at the growth  stage coinciding with the asymptotes, tree stem profile  is a cubic paraboloid with form factor 0.6. As a stand  approaches its asymptotic limits, all trees will be ap-proaching  the same form, and hence stand form factor  approaches this same value. However, analysts using  our suggested approach can assume any asymptotic  form factor they desire.  The asymptotic tree density was estimated using Eq.

Hara (1984) showed time trajectories of density de-crease  for Douglas-fir growing in California. The pa-rameters  used in his models were obtained from Doug-las-  fir normal yield tables. He found that asymptotic  tree densities were 49 trees/ha for a high-fertility site  (site index: 43 m, base age: 50 yr), 77 trees/ha for a  medium-fertility site (site index: 3 1 m), and 136 trees/  ha for a low-fertility site (site index: 18 m). These re-sults  are very similar to the estimated asymptotic num-ber  of trees per hectare (N,) for grand fir or western  hemlock habitat types shown in Table 2. Lower site  quality represented by Douglas-fir habitat types were  not included in Hara's estimates.  Parallel analysis  Stand basal area and survival models were directly  fit to the previously described data using a Richards  function (Richards 1959). The parameters of the Rich-ards  function were expressed as functions of Douglas-fir  site index or initial relative-density index (Drew and  Flewelling 1979) in a similar way as proposed by Har-rison  and Daniels (1987). The resulting models were  as follows:  .[l - e-0 0057 HL)o (TOPH-4 5 )I0 0055 DFSl (14)  and  ,[I - e-0 66 HDo (TOPH-4 5 )I 0 009 DFSl  &gt; (15)  where BA is stand basal area, N is the density of sur-viving  trees, DFSI is Douglas-fir site index, TOPH is  stand top height, and RD, is initial relative density  index. When the models were fit to the data, conver-gence  difficulties were encountered, especially for the  survival model. The model statistics also showed some  undesirable properties, such as large parameter esti-mation  errors. Given these model formulations, the  empirical asymptotic BA (BA*,) and N (N*,) can be  estimated for selected site indices as follows:  BA*, = 6.30.DFSI (16)  and  17 650  A'?,=-  DFSI '  Table 4 shows the comparison between the calculated  empirical BA*, and N*, from Eqs. 16 and 17 with our  theoretical asymptotes (BA, and N,). The empirical  estimates, BA*, and N*,, were higher than our the-oretical  estimates. The empirical estimates of NY, seem  unreasonably large. In our experience, these empirical  results typify the problems associated with estimating  asymptotic parameters directly from ""inadequate"" data.  Since the Competition-Density (C-D) relationship  is applied to all stands and the coefficients of the re-ciprocal  equation of the C-D effect are constant for  any stage of stand development, available stand growth  data can be used to develop the equations relating the  coefficients to stand top heights. These established re-lationships  provide a basis for relating current stand  conditions to the ""law"" of constant final yield. If stand  top height is estimated using stand age, site index, and  habitat type, then asymptotic top height can be ob-tained  for any combination of site qualities and habitat  types, with age set to infinity. Asymptotic top height  plays a key role in this approach. If reliable height  growth equations or stem-analysis data are not avail-able,  then the proposed method loses much of its ad-vantage  over a strictly empirical approach. Asymptotic  yield, basal area, and tree density are actually functions  of asymptotic top height. Consequently, asymptotic  yield, basal area, and tree density can be estimated for  different site quality and habitat types representing dif-ferent  patterns of stand development. The approach  seems to provide reasonable estimates of the asymp-totes  required for developing sigmoid-shaped growth  models.

(2) Development of operational gUidelines and best management pmetices for forest  fertilization.  Quantifying long..term N fettilization effects (Priority 3), was still considered desirable but  the Steering Committee (SC) decided that exrending the length offuture remeasurement  cycles should be considered in planning future work.  The SC developed a set of desirable outcomes from future IFINC activities as follows:  Associated with priority (1);  CA) Improved ability to diagnose nutrient deficiencies and consequent effect on the  process of forest longevity. resilience, and productivity.  (B) Improved ability to efficiently conserve and enhance nutrients.  (C) Develop correlations of nutrient levels with forest growth and mortality  performance.  . .  (D) Evaluate the effects of silvicultural activities on. nutrient levels. (1his was  considered to be incidental to A, B. and C above).  (E) Develop a prescription recommendation system for nutrient l118J\.&gement.  Associated with priority (2);  (A) Develop Best Management Practices for fertilization!nutrient conservation by the  IFlNC.  (B) Communicate (transfer) the above information to the profession, the public, and  regulatory agencies.  The SC instrUcted the Technical Committee (TAC) and staff to develop plans and proposals to  achieve outcomes 1A through E above for consideration by the SC. Item 2A will be  3  accomplished by the TAC (or a subcommittee) and the staff to be submitted to the SC for  considemtion at a funue date.

Further, to keep the IFINC's goal statement closely in line with the stated outcomes, the SC  approved the following goal statement:  The coal of the IFrNC is to promote forest laDgerity, resilience and  productivity through undersamdiDg of nuuieDt cycles, COIIICmltion of Dative  nuuic:na through appiopDate forest manapmrmr pracdces aDd amelioration  of nutric:nt deficiencies through sumd culture or the addition of fertiHzc:n or  other amendments•  . .«.,J.t&. !6!,~,.'"".'""i}!X(:&MiI03':;3,&w;:;:;;;:J!i.aw;;:;:;:wa;w:;¥.6.b.:!:.t¥.ti4':V:GiW:G.~'&gt;\4 !""tMW;"" mm!'«((.','.I)'.;:;;p::Q'iW&lt;:;w;:.,(Q"".,....J.. .. ... 1~.""..""U;:;;,C.J'O.:;;.=""':::;i':.;...  THE NEW EXPERIMENI  An Fmpbalil on Porest Heabh aDd Nutrition  Preface: Previous results from IF1NCDoug.& and ponderosa pine expetimem:s suggest a link  between nutrition, particularly potassium nutrition, and insect and disease pests. Mortality rates'  in the Douglas..fir trials were significandy higher in stands with poor pte..tteaanent foliar K status  after application of 400 Ibs. of Nt Ac. Interestuigly, the most common mortality causes in this  K status! treatment category were mot rots and bark beedes.  Results from the Montana ponderosa pine experiment showed that N only treated plotS  experienced higher mortality rates, producing a net loss in volume growth after ~ yealS.  Conversely, N + K treated plots showed less mortality than c:onttol plots. The net volume  growth effect associated with adding Kwas highly signiDcam. Mortality on the N only plots was  six times as great as control plot mortality; over 809€» of it teSU1ting from bark beede activity N  + K plots showed less mortality than control plots with no bark beede mortality.  Hypothesis: Potassium nutrition affects tree resistance to AnniIlaria (and pethaps other diseases  and insects as well) by influencing the concentrations of phenolics, tannins and supES in tree  roots.  State of KnowledHe: Entry et al 1991 found that rates of infection by AnniIlaria ostoyae were  highest in trees that were thinned and fertilized with nitrogen and lowest in trees that were only  thinned. Concentrations of sugar, starch, and cellulose in mot bark tissue were highest in N  fertilized trees and lowest in trees that were thinned but not fertilized. Concentrations of~, .  phenolics, and tannins were highest in lOOt bark from thinned only ttees and lowest in mot bark  from thinned and N fertili%ed trees. They suggest that fertilized trees may allocate more carbon  to sugar and cellulose and less to tree defense compounds, such as lignin, phenolics, and tannins.  High amounts of N may shift catbon aUoc;ation from the shikimic acid pathways to support  increased photosynthetic area, thereby reducing concentrations of phenolics arid lignins in lOOt  bark tissue. Results of their study are similar to those of others who have analyzed phenolic  concentrations in plant tissues. Bryant et al (1987) reported that N fertilization increased tree  growth but deaeased the concentration of phenolic compounds in leaf tissue of birch. The low  sugar concentrations in tree mots growing in thinned only stands may have provided less energy  for Armillaria to degrade phenolic compounds and lignin, and. thereby, successfully invade host  tissue. Entty et al (1991) also found that the ratio of energy required for phenolic or lignin  degradation to the enetgy available from sugars to Armilbu;ia may provide dependable assays of  the physiological response of trees to attack by Armillaria.  In a separate study, Entry et al (1992) found that tree species that are more susceptible to  infection by Armillaria produce lower concentrations of phenolics and more sugar in mot bark,  thereby increasing the energy available to the fungus to degrade the phenolics and invade the  .... t .. .it ..

This result is consistent wU:h previous greenhouse and 6eld studies. Waqo (1984)  proposed that pathogenic species of Armd1aria infect ham because the enagy available to the  fungus through sugars, nitrogen, and ethanol in root bark is peat enough to overcome hast  defense compounds such as tannins and phenolics. Enay et al's (1992) study and previous  stUdies support this hypothesis. WallO suggestS that high concentmioDs ofphenolic compounds  inhibit growth of Annillaria. Increased glucose conc:enaatiDn enables Armillaria to grow in the  presence of inhibitory concentrations of phenolics.  The textbook"" Potassium in Agriculture (1985)"" contains an entire chapter titled .. Pomssium·  Intemctions with Plant Disease"". Thete are more than 100 references documenting K nuaition  I disease intemctions (some regarding treeS). Following are I01Ile excezpts from the book:  II The intricate relationship of K nutrition to metabolic functions and growth, as well as its  interrelationship with the various other nuaierus within the plant and soiL plOVic1e ample  opportunity for K to modify disease resistance or susceptibility.

To accomplish this we pmpose to establish trials in an agreed upon matrix covering typical iarest  habitat typeS and soils found in the region (Figure 1). There will be a COle experiment  conducted in all the sttaca shown in Figure 1. In addition, there will be maca specific.  pteScriptions (treatments) tested (Table 1).  Nitrogen Rate Experiment:  The basic experiment involves a factorial design ofN and IC fettilization, each at 2 rates, for a  total of 4 plots. One tate will be 0; the other will be represent an amount likely to yield optimal  response; 300 #/a for N and 200 #/a of Kwill be tested.  This basic experiment will be replicated on 3 sites in each of 12 categories. the latter based on  combinations ofparent material (granite, basalt. metasediment, andmixed.glacial) andvegetation  series (OF, OF, and WRC), yielding a total of 36 sites (see Figure 1). Stands selected will be  mixed conifer (primarily composed of grand fir, Douglas-fir, and Ponderosa pine but including  other species as well) between 15 and 80 yeats old that have had some saEt of stocking control  conducted at least 5 yeats previous to plot establishment.  Each plot will be 1/2 aae in size with a buffer strip. Mortality would be monitored over the  entire plot and growth measurements would be taken on an interior 1110 aae ploe. ~1.  most~ii.!Perl!!! op:~~ ~ fOliage, 'bOl~-maiciifiiiDPIes wilr~-:m11e~ar£iO;n 10 _  .viitliin each 1/2 a~ .plot._ .  Annillaria resistance/susceptibility will be assayed by inoculating roots and monitoring' iiUection  incidence and by analyzing the organic chemistry of selected individual tree roOt samples. Bark  beetle resistance will be quantified by measuring production of secondary resins and acetone..  soluble compounds in wounds inoculated with a mountain pine beede fungal symbiont  (Europhium clavigerum).  On four sites, mountain pine beetle atttaaant will be used to aama beedes to plots; beede  population parameters will be measured to judge tree resistance. As such treatment is likely to  Id1l most of the plot trees and prevent further meaningful plot monitoring, these sites (an  additional 4 plots) will be somewhat removed from the rest of the plots (Figure 1).  ... t 53)h:n, ('W:;.C,Q!&gt;.&Z¥4. .

"" tw·  8  Vegetation Control experiment:  On sites with a substantial understory component, a vegetation conaol maar will be added to  the basic experiment. This will require an additional 4 plots treated with herbicide. Any site  with greater that 30 peICeIlt shrub and gmss cover would include this additional treatment If  beede attractana ate to be used on such a site, an additional 8 plots (one replication) will be  needed.  Response Sunace Designs:  A basic N and K response surface (RS) design using a central c:cmposite design will be  accomplished using 14 ploa at each installation in 8 of 12 habitat type lIOn mats (Figure 1).  These 14 ploa, when combined with the nitrogen tate expetiment, would give us responses for  a total of 5 different rates of both N and K fettilizadon.  For N, we want to try tates higher than 400 #/8 since we have already demonsaated significant  increases from 400 over 200 #/8 rates for certain tegions, vegetation typeS, etc. Thus, we  propose 8 design using a 600 #/a maximnm treatment. For K, the choice is less obvious since  we have litde infotDUltion on which to base 8 decision. Ifwe QI-ect maximum response at 200  #Kla, then we should use a maximnm rate of 400 #KlL  Recommendations by Vegeration Series:  Western Red Cedar Type: Mortality rates in this type for the OF experiment showed no trends  with K treatments, although there were some weak trends ofglowth response improvement with.  K amendments. But this type does show significant differences in growth response between ioo  and 400 #N treatments. Thus, a straightforward N rate trial would be most suitable for these  sitesj using rates of 100, 200,300, and 600 #/a. Bar~ beede mortality is very low on this type,  so experiments with attractants are not recommended here. . .  Since not too many plots are needed on this type, we will replicate the tate trial plots to allow  for repeated fertilizer applications at four installations. Based on the Belfair Washington ONR  results we might expect to get maximum growth response ifwe retreated every 3 or 4 yean. while  our own OF experiment tells us that first treatment direct effects last at least 8 vealS on our  better sites; retreaanenr at veaa 4 and 8 will be tested on our new sites. A factorial design with  5 rates (0, 100, 200,300 and 600) and 2 retreatment frequencies (once and twice per 8 yean)  would require 7 addition plots. However, this requires a long term commitment to these plots-..  monitoring for 12 or more yean. .  Grand Fa Type: Potassium seems to have ia greatest effect on this type in the Douglas-fir  species experiment, so we will test various K tates here. Even though this type did not produce  great differences between 200 and 400 #N responses to the original treatments, addition of K  • 9  may change this story. RS designs will be used here &lt;FiIure 1). Both buk beetles and root roa  ate important mortality factors, 10 both sorts of inoculations will be conduaed on all parent  materials on this habitat type.  The N andKresponse sutface design requires 14 plots (18 when herbicide use is included in the  basic faetarial). 10 little lOOm is left for expanding the experiment in other ways.  Douglas-Fir T-,pe: Previous results for this type ate similar to those for the WR.C type; we have  no evidence ofKeffects on this type, bue do show significant inaeues in gross growth response'  to 400 #N/a velSUS 200 #/a. Thus. experiments lookiDg at N mre-related response are in order.  Bark beetle monality is very important on this type, so beetle attmctant. experiments will be  conducted on four installations on DF habitat types. 1Dstallations with bark beetle aaraaana  require an additional four ploa spatially separated from the rest of the installation.  All establishment, aeaanent application, ttee measmement, lOil, foliage, lOOt, and bark sampling  and analysis will follow the existing procedures of the IF1NC stUdy plan (or as ammended).

Measurements were taken before (October, 1990) and  after (September, 1992) the application of the treatments. All  live plot trees were tagged and measured for total height and  diameter at breast-height (DBH). In the young standS, if a tree  was less than 4.5 feet tall, the caliper at ground level was  measured instead of DBH. Tree volume and crown competition factor  were estimated using species-specific equations in the stand  Prognosis Model (wykoff et ale 1982). Basal areas and total  volumes were summed over all trees to obtain plot totals. The  averages and ranges of stand characteristics for each treatment  were given in Table 1 for the pole stands and in Table 2 for the  young stands.

The object4ve of the statistical analysis is to investigate  the treatment effects on stand volume, basal area, and height  qrowth. The analyses were conducted separately for the pole and  young stands by tree species as follows.  I. S~a~is~ical ADalysis for Pon4erosa Pin. Pol. S~aD4s.  There are 3 installations and 24 plots for the Ponderosa  pine pole stands. Two sites had all four treatments (20 plots),  while one had only control and herbicide treatments (4 of the_6  plots in the installation). These installations were analyzed as  one experiment. The experimental desiqn model took the general  form of a covariance model:  GROWTB =P (INSTALLATION, TllBA'rKD'l', COVARIATB)  where:  GROWTH - the stand qrowth inclUding gross volume qrowth  (ft'/acre), qross basal area growth (ft2/acre), and mean height  qrowth (ft),  INSTALLATION - installation,  TREATMENT - treatments: a-control, l-fertilizer, 2­herbicide,  and 3-fertilizer + herbicide,  COVARIATE - covariate variable: initial volume was used as  the covariate variable for volume qrowth analyses; and initial  basal area was used as the covariate variable for basal area and  height qrowth analyses.  6  7  The analysis of variance for the growth and growth response  for this Ponderosa pine experiment are provided in Table 3. The  contrasts between treatment means are considered as the average  growt:h responses to the treatments. The growth responses are  smoothed estimates which were adjusted for covariate variables  (initial volume or basal area) as indicated by the statistical  model shown above.  The growth and response estimates for gross volume growth is  provided in Table 3(a). Volume responses for all three treatments  were about the same (20% to 22%). The herbicide and the combined  treatment were marginally statistically significant (a =0.1)~  There was no overall sYnergistic effect from the combined  fertilizer and herbicide effect.  The results were essentially the same for basal area growth  response (Table 3(b», with relative responses ranging from about  20 to 24%. The herbicide treatment was marginally statistically  significant (a =0.1).  Height growth response to the fertilizer only treatment was  about 42% (a = 0.12) two years after treatment. The herbicide  only and combined treatment effects were positive but not  statistically significant. The lack of statistical significance  in the response of these pole stands is not surprising since the  ""power"" of the experiment is low and the magnitude of the  response is highly variable across the installations.  The Ponderosa pine stands, particularly CAM, showed much  higher response than the Lodgepole pine stand (LAX) for all 3  8  Table 3(a).

Since there is only  one Lodgepole pine pole stand, it is not possible to attribute  the lack of response at LAK to species versus installation (site)  effects. However, species response differences may be worth  pursuing in future study. It is also interesting that the  magnitude of the relative fertilization responses is about what  would be expected based on the IFTNC Ponderosa pine trials in  Montana. Further, most of the treatment response at CAM seems to  derive from a herbicide effect.  II. statistical ADalysis for Young Ponderosa Pin. stands.  There are 7 installations and 47 plots for the Ponderosa  pine young stands. Three sites had all four treatments. The other  5 young installations had only the control and herbicide  treatments. If a plot was dominated by species other than  Ponderosa pine, it was not used in the analysis. There are many  missing DBB observations for trees less than 4.5 feet tall. The  statistical analysis was focused on mean tree height growth.  However, tests on mean diameter and caliper growth were also  conducted to investigate the treatment effects on the growth of  larger and smaller trees in the young stands. The experimental  design model is similar to that for the pole stands. The initial  diameter was used as a covariate for height and diameter  analyses, but not for caliper analysis.  10  Table 4.

Overall height growth response for these Ponderosa pine  installations is provided for each treatment in Table 7(a).  Fertilizer only treatment had a negative non-significant effe~t  on the average, while herbicide treatment produced a significant  positive response. The combined fertilizer and herbicide  treatment produced the largest height growth response. The same  results were true for diameter growth response of these young  Ponderosa pine stands (Table 7(b». The caliper growth of the  smallest trees (less than 4.5 feet tall) in these stands was  significantly effected only by the herbicide treatments (Table  7(c». Herbicide is the most responsive treatment in these young  ponderosa stands, although there is some evidence for a  synergistic effect from the combined fertilizer and herbicide  treatment.  In ten young stands, pronone herbicide was the only  treatment tested. Five of the stands were Ponderosa pine and  their height growth response ranqed from 4.4 to 27.5% (Table 8),  while diameter growth response was larger, ranging from 5.8 to  Table 7(a).

For the smallest trees (less than 4.5 feet  tall), basal caliper growth was analyzed and the herbicide  treatment produced the largest relative growth increase after two  years (up to about 70%, Table 10) for these baby trees. We also  analyzed a variable that is proportional to volume response for  these little trees (Table 11). There was a nice (approximate 38%  growth increase) SYnergistic effect for the combined fertilizer  and herbicide treatment for the JOB installation.  xxx. Treatment Effects on po1iar Butrient.  The treatments all had a positive effect on foliar N, P, and  K (Table 12). The largest effect was on foliar H, both the  fertilizer and the combination treatments produced about a 17%  increase in foliar N. Even the herbicide only treatment increased  foliar N about 9%. Phosphorus and potassium concentrations were  significantly increased only by the combination treatment (15%  and 12%, respectively). The foliar KIN ratio was significantly  reduced by the fertilizer treatment (Table 12), while the  herbicide and the combination treatments did not have a  significant effect on the KIN ratio.  The three treatments had different effects on foliar Nand K  concentrations (Figures 1 through 3). The herbicide only  treatment generally increased both foliar Nand K concentrations  (except on installations BUL and IND where both nutrients  decreased). Thus, the KIN ratio was little changed (Figure 3).  17  Table 9. Two-year diameter growth and response for young stands.

One-year change in foliar KIN ratio after fertilizer, herbicide, or combined  fertilizer and herbicide treatments.  24  The fertilizer only treatment usually increased both N and K  concentrations (except for the BUL site), but there was a  relatively greater increase in N resulting in an average decrease  in the foliar KIN ratio. The combined fertilizer and herbicide  treatment showed a greater proportionate increase in K than N,  thus the KIN ratio increased after treatment. These results  suggest that the understory plants may have some competitive  advantage over the trees in taking up the additional K supplied  by the fertilizer (Figure 2). However, the understory did not  seem to have a similar effect on foliar N (Figure 1).  IV. Relationships Bet.een poliar IlUtrients an4 Treat:laent Growth  Re.pon••  Regression analyses were conducted to investigate the  relationships between foliar nutrient estimates and two-year  relative growth response for the Ponderosa pine sites. The  results showed that the change in N (Tables 1 and 2; Figures 1  and 2, Appendix D) was not a significant predictor of response.  However, similar to previous IFTNC results, the change in foliar  KIN ratio was a significant predictor of Ponderosa pine response  (Table 13 and Figure 4). If the KIN ratio decreased following  treatment, then growth response was negative; if the KIN ratio  increased, then growth response also increased. Interestingly, a  decreasing KIN ratio was usually associated with the fertilizer  only treatment while increasing foliar KIN ratios resulted from  the combined treatment.  Table 13.

Introduction  In 1980 a group of forestry organizations fonned the Intennountain Forest Tree  Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) to study forest tree nutrition in the intermountain region of  the Pacific Northwest, USA. Early IFTNC results from studies of Rocky Mountain  Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco) had shown that nitrogen  (N) levels were generally inadequate throughout the region (Mika and Moore 1991) and  that positive gross volume response occurred when N fertilizer was applied (Moore et aJ.  1991). However, trees on some sites showed no increased growth 6 years after N  fertilization and higher N application rates did not consistently produce higher response.  Average mortality rates also appeared to increase with N fertilization (Mika et al. 1992);  wind and snow breakage and root rot mortality were higher on N treated plots in certain  areas.  Analysis of tree nutrient status indicated that tree potassium (K) status was  associated with growth response to N fertilization (Mika and Moore 1991). For sites where  pretreatment foliar K levels were low, response to N fertilization was reduced and higher  rates of N fertilization produced less response. Tree mortality appeared to be increased by  N fertilization on such sites, particularly where N rates were high. Across all sites, declines  in net growth following N fertilization were associated with decreases in foliar K levels.  Based on these results we concluded that a number of sites in the region lacked  sufficient K to allow the maximum expression of tree growth, a condition normally masked  3  by lack of sufficient N. This also led to the hypothesis that, when fertilizing with N,  addition of K could prevent some of the negative N fertilizer effects we encountered. To  test this, the IFTNC subsequently established a series of 6 N and K fertilizer trials in  ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug!.) in northwestern Montana. In this paper we  present evidence that K amendments to N fertilizers prevented mortality associated with N  treated plots, thereby increasing net volume response to fertilization.  Materials and Methods  In 1987 the IFTNC established 6 fertilizer trials in northwest Montana, a  mountainous region shaped by continental and alpine glaciation. Major formations rise to  elevations of 3000 meters and support extensive forests. Precambrian Belt Series  metasediments, mostly quartzite and argillite, dominate the surface geology of the region,  although alluvial deposits from stream or glacial action are found in most valleys. The  region has an inland climate influenced by moist air from the north Pacific Ocean,  producing mild, cloudy weather for much of the year. Precipitation, generally snow, falls  mostly from November to June while summers are droughty (pfister et a/. 1977).  The fertilizer trials, termed installations, were located in second-growth, even-aged,  managed ponderosa pine stands; stand age ranged from 33 to 98 years. Stands were either  previously thinned or naturally well-spaced; stand basal area ranged from 19 to 33 m2 ha""'.  The stands are dominated by ponderosa pine, but other species contributing substantial basal  area include Douglas-ftr and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.). Two installations  were located on valley fill soils--ancient tertiary mixes of clay and rock. Another pair of  installations were situated on colluvial material dominated by Belt Series metasediments.  4  The fmal pair were located on alluvial deposits resulting from Pleistocene lake beds.  An installation consists of 6 rectangular plots 0.04 ha in size, each containing at  least ten ponderosa pine sample trees. Plots were selected to minimize among-plot variation  in terrain, vegetation composition, tree stocking, and tree size; within each installation, plots  were blocked into 2 groups of 3 plots based on similarity. Three fertilizer treatments--a  control, 225 kg N ha·l  , and 225 kg N + 225 kg K ha·1 --were randomly assigned to the  plots within each block. Nitrogen, as urea, and K, as murate of potash (KCI), were applied  in the late fall, utilizing hand-held spreaders. To minimize edge effects, a treated buffer  strip surrounds all fertilized plots.  All live plot trees were tagged and measured for heights and diameters at the time of  treatment and remeasured 4 years after treatment Any incidence of damage or mortality  was noted. Tree volumes were calculated using regional species-specific volume equations  (Wykoff et al. 1982). Basal areas and total volumes were summed over all trees to obtain  plot totals.  One year after treatment, dormant season foliage samples were obtained from two  dominant or co-dominant ponderosa pine trees on each plot (12 per installation, 72 total).  Current season foliage was collected from the third whorl from the top of each tree by  climbing. Foliage was processed and analyzed for content of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, Fe,  B, and Cu using procedures described by Mika and Moore (1991).  Fertilizer effects on total plot tree growth were estimated using a randomized block  analysis of covariance model. The particular model fit was (after Federer, 1955):  (1)  5  where Yjjk is the 4-year growth for the plot (ie. the Ie"" fertilizer treatment of the jib block  within the ilb installation), f.1 is the overall mean effect, Ii is a random effect due to the ilb  installation, Bj(j) is a random effect due to the jib block within the ilb installation, F k is the  effect due to the klb fertilizer treatment, Xvk is the basal area per ha at the start of the  experiment for the plot, 13 is the coefficient for the regression of growth on initial basal  area, and eijk is a random error effect.  The regression coefficient obtained by fitting Equation (1) was used to adjust plot  growth rates for within-installation differences in initial basal area per hal Growth response  to fertilization was then calculated by subtracting adjusted growth on control plots from .  similar growth on fertilized plots. These adjusted fertilizer response rates were used in  subsequent analysis. Standard regression techniques were employed to examine  relationships between fertilizer response and foliar nutrient levels. Parameter estimates and  adjusted means were obtained using a general linear models procedure (SAS Institute Inc.,  1985).  Results  Analysis of gross growth (accretion) data for the 4 years following treatment (Table  1) shows that fertilization has a significant effect (p=O.0115) on tree volume growth.  Estimates of gross volume growth for the various fertilizer treatment have been adjusted to  a common initial basal area of 27 m2 ha-I using Equation (1). The table also includes  estimates of differences between treatments and significance levels for tests that those  differences are zero. The difference between N fertilized and control plots shows the  growth response to N fertilization, while the difference between the N only and N+K  6  treatments represents the effect of K additions.  As expected, N fertilized trees grew significantly more (p=O.OOOI) on the average  than unfertilized trees: growth increased by 4.8 m3 ha·l  , an 11.6 % increase over control  plot growth rates. Plots treated with N+K grew even more (7.56 m3 ha-I  ), but the increase  over the N alone treatment (2.76 m3 ha·l  ) was not significant (p=0.2542).  Similar results for net volume growth are shown in Table 2. Overall variation in  growth is larger; the total sum of squares shows a 28 % increase over that for gross growth.  The pattern of response is much different: N alone treatments show a negative, non­significant  response of -2.58 m3 ha·1 (-6.3 % of the control net growth rate) while N+K  plots show a large, marginally-significant response (p=O.1234) of 7.87 m3 ha·l. In this case  the K amendment resulted in a large, highly-significant (p=O.0505), additional response of  10.45 m3 ha-I.  This large K effect can be better understood by looking at the cumulative frequency  distribution of net volume response presented in Figure 1. The horizontal axis shows  values of 4 year net volume response (difference between treated and control plots) while  the vertical axis shows the proportion of stands responding at a particular value or less.  While all stands showed positive growth response when fertilized with N+K, half of the  installations showed negative response to N alone. These negative responders are  installations where mortality was higher on the N-treated plots than on the controls. As  seen in Figure 2, nearly all mortality was caused by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus  ponderosae Hopkins). While mortality was fairly high on N plots, no bark beetle mortality  occurred when N and K were both applied, despite the close proximity of all the plots.  7  Trees on those plots only treated with N are apparently more susceptible to bark beetle  attack.  Regression of adjusted net volume response obtained from equation (1) on control  plot foliar nutrient status revealed that response was related to both foliar N concentration  and K:N ratios, but differed for the fertilizer treatments. The relationship of response to  foliar nutrient level for the two treatments is depicted in Figure 3: the solid line represents  the least-squares fit for plots treated with N only, while the dotted line shows the regression  for N+K treated plots.  For foliar N concentration, the model shown in Figure 3a was highly significant  (p=O.038) and accounted for 63 % of the variation in net volume response. The slope of  the relationship differed significantly between the two fertilizer treatment (p=O.0305). For  plots treated only with N, net volume response declined as N concentration of the control  plots increased. Large volume losses occurred on sites where N levels were already. high.  However, when treated with N+K, such sites responded to the same extent as all other sites;  the slope of the relationship for N+K treatments is not significantly different from 0  (p=0.4607).  The model for foliar K:N ratio shown in Figure 3b was also significant (p=O.0681)  and accounted for 57 % of the variation in net volume response. Again, slopes differed for  the two treatments (p=O.0549). Net volume response increased as the K:N ratio of the  control plots increased when only N was applied. Large volume losses were confined to  those installation where control plots had low K:N ratios. When K was also applied,  volume loss did not occur on those sites. Again the slope of the relationship for N+K  8  treated plots was not significantly different than 0 (p=O.5239).  Discussion  We have found evidence that, on some sites in northwest Montana, addition of N  through fertilization can lead to increased ponderosa pine mortality from mountain pine  beetle. An induced K deficiency is implicated, as addition of K prevented such mortality.  Trees on these sites had foliage with fairly high concentrations of N and low ratios of K to  N; addition of more N to these sites could easily produce conditions of nutrient imbalance  within the trees. While we do not know the exact mechanism by which lack of K  produces trees more susceptible to mountain pine beetle attack, combining the existing  knowledge about tree resistance to bark beetles with information on the role of K in tree  nutrition can give us some good clues.  Unlike most insects that feed on plants, bark beetles need to kill their host in order  to successfully reproduce. They are assisted by their mutualistic relationship with microbial  phytopathogens. The tree, when attacked, must combat both the insect and its fungal allies;  it attempts to do this by isolating the insect and its fungal symbionts within a lesion of dead  cells. This process, known as a secondary, or hypersensitive, response to bark beetle attack,  is known to occur in all conifers. The process involves a series of activities: local autolysis  of parenchyma cells, traumatic resin duct formation, and secondary resin production. The  end result is phloem tissue unsuitable for either insect or fungus development (Raffa and  Berryman 1982a).  Differences in tree resistance to bark beetle attack result from varying ability to  produce secondary resins. Resin production in resistant trees is more rapid and has higher  f  9  concentrations of monoterpenes (Wright et al. 1979, Raffa and Berryman 1982a) and other  acetone-soluble compounds (Raffa and Berryman 1983), and increased proportions of more  toxiclrepellant monoterpenes like limonene and myrcene (Raffa and Berryman 1982b). The  secondary response of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) to mountain pine beetle  attack is a rapid, localized, generalized reaction, involving an increased abundance of all  monoterpenes produced by on-site synthesis and/or transport from adjacent tissue.  Tree vigor is known to influence bark beetle resistance, with trees under various  types of stress (disease, crowding, artificial stress) showing increased susceptibility to bark  beetle attack. It is thought that stress alters the pattern of tree enzyme activation/synthesis  in response to attack (Raffa and Berryman 1982b). The response reaction is energy  demanding, switching acetyl-coenzyme A from the Krebs cycle to the mevalonic acid  pathway; each molecule of monoterpene produced costs 90 ATP molecules. Amounts of  sugars and starches in the inner bark are positively correlated with resin monoterpene  concentration, showing the importance of carbohydrate reserves for successful resistance  (Wright et af 1979).  Potassium functions in a plant include control of water relations through stomatal  control and regulation of turgor, energy relations including phosphorylation and  photoreduction, starch synthesis, and translocation of carbohydrates, enzyme activation, and  nitrogen assimilation and protein synthesis (Mengel and Kirkby 1980, Marschner 1986).  Given such a broad role in plant functioning, the likelihood of K impact on plant health is  high; in fact, the importance of proper levels of K for plant resistance to insects and disease  is well documented. Huber and Amy (1985), in their review of K interactions with disease,  10  state that the role of K as a mobile regulator of enzyme activity involve it in most cellular  functions influencing disease severity. Accumulation of inhibitory compounds around  infection sites is dependent on the level of K; high K levels promote rapid wound healing  and accumulation of fungitoxic compounds around wounds while, at low K levels,  compounds with fungicidal properties are rapidly broken down.  Given the important roles of K in the formation and transport of carbohydrates and  in enzyme activation, it is easy to see that K deficiency could reduce a tree's ability to  produce secondary resins. The next step in our research will be to attempt to show that N  and N+K fertilizer treatments do affect this hypersensitive reaction in ponderosa pine. To  establish this, we will look at bole chemistry and secondary resin production on these  installations. Additional trials will also be established in which bark beetles will be brought  to the plots by using attractants; beetle population parameters will be measured to determine  if tree resistance varies among treatments.  The nutrient budget of sites and a tree's internal nutrient balance may be altered in  ways other than by direct nutrient amendments. Forest practices may remove or redistribute  substantial amounts of biomass and, with that, significant amounts of nutrients.  Atmospheric depositions may differentially increase or decrease nutrient availability.  Events producing the kinds of imbalances observed in this study are likely to have similar  consequences for tree health.  References  Federer W T 1955 Experimental Design: Theory and ~pplication.

The experimental design model took the general form of a  covariance model:  GROWTH =P (INSTALLATION, BLOCK, TREATKENT, BAo)  3  where: GROWTH - the growth includes gross and net basal area  growth (ft2/acre) for two-year after treatment.  BAo - initial basal area as a covariate variable.  The analysis of variance for gross and net basal area growth  and response are provided in Table 1 and illustrated in Figures 1  and 2. The contrasts between treatment means are considered as  the average growth responses to the treatments. The growth  responses are smoothed estimates which were adjusted for initial  basal area.

Figure 5 shows a  significant trend of increasing N response versus increasing  pretreatment foliar K concentration. Sites that had higher K  concentrations responded better to fertilization with N. Nitrogen  response increases as foliar KIN ratio decreases after treatment  (Figure 6). This is counter to previous IFTNC results for the  Ponderosa pine experiment. Perhaps an explanation is that the  change in KIN ratio is dominated by the change in foliar N after  treatment. The largest change in the KIN ratio occurred on those  sites that had the highest KIN ratio initially.

[Traduit par la redactionl  Introduction  Probability distributions are often used to describe the fre­quency  distribution of tree breast-height diameters in forest  stands. These distributions can take on a variety of shapes and  typically can be described as nonsymmetric (either positively  or negatively skewed). Although many different distribution  functions have been used. the Weibull and Johnson's S8 dis­tributions  have probably received the most attention in the  forestry literature.  The method of percentiles or quantiles is one of several  methods used to estimate the parameters of these probability  distributions. Percentile parameter estimation involves solving  equations for the distribution parameters as functions of one  or more estimated quantiles. which can be derived as func­tions  of the sample-based order statistics. Several distribution­free  methods have been proposed for estimating the quantiles.  The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate several  of these sample quantile estimators in the process of modeling  forest diameter distributions with either the Weibull or John­son's  S8 distributions for even-aged Douglas-fir (Pselldotsllga  menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) stands in the Inland  Northwest.  Quantile estimation functions  Let X be a continuous random variilble and let XI. X2' ....  XII be a sample of size II from X.

X(II) be the sample-based order statistics such that  x(I) SX(2) S ,., S X(II)' Based on these assumptions, the sample­based  functions used to estimate the pth (0 &lt; p &lt; 1) quantile  are given in Table 1, The notation and naming conventions  used in Table 1 follow those in the UNIVARIATE procedure  (SAS Institute Inc. 1985) and Parrish (1990).  Most of the estimators. YI • f 2• f 3• fs, f6• and f 7 are based  on either x(j) and (or) x(j+ I) where np = j + g,j and g are the  integer and decimal portions of np. respectively. The estimate  of fl for the pth quantile as discussed by Parzen (1979) is the  weighted average. based on g. of the order statistics on either  side of the point np. This method was used by Bailey et aI.  (1981) in the process of estimating parameters of the Weibull  distribution for modeling diameter distributions of thinned  slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations. Methods f 2•  f), f 6• and Y7 utilize a single order statistic as the quantile  estimate. The f 2 method of estimating the pth quantile is the  order statistic closest to np. Method f 3• also discussed by  Parzen (1979) and used by Dubey (1967). can be described  as the smallest value of x such that Fcx) ~ p. Method f 7 can  g,enerally be described as the smallest value of X such that  F(x) &gt; p and method f 6 qlO generally be described as the larg­est  value of x such that F(x) S p. Minor exceptions to these  descriptions of f 6 and f 7 do occur at the extremes of the  distribution. Zarnoch and Dell (1985) and Shiver (1988) esti­mated  parameters of the Weibull distribution for stand diam­eter  distributions using f 6• Csorg6 and Revesz (1978) and  David (1981) defined the plh quantile a{tel: Yi  .

This is the  definition used for the pth quantile in Conover (1980).  Methods Y4 and Yg estimate the pth quantile as the weighted  average of adjacent order statistics as does YI • Method Y4•  mentioned by Harrell and Davies (1982) as a ""traditional""  quantile estimator. weights the order statistics around the  point (n + 1)p. while Yg weights the order statistics around  np +0.5. Parzen (1979) indicated that Yg should provide good  quantile estimates under conditions of small sample sizes and  symmetric distributions.  Using the equations from Table I. seven of the eight quan­tile  functions can be ranked according to the relative value of  their estimates. It can be shown. for g =O. that YI =Y2 =Y3=  Y6 &lt; Ys = Yg &lt; Y7; for 0 &lt; g &lt; 0.5. that Y2 = Y6 &lt; YI &lt; Yg &lt;  Y3 =Ys=Y7; for 0.5 ::;; g &lt; 1.0. that Y6 &lt; Y1 &lt; Y2 =Y3 =Ys=  Y7 ::;; Yg. Method Y4 cannot be so easily characterized. In  addition to g. the ranking of Y4 depends on p. In general. for  a given value of g. the value of Y4 increases (or at least does  not decrease) as p increases.  Parrish (1990) compared 10 methods for estimating quan­tiles  for normal distributions. eight of which are evaluated in  this study. The best estimators were Yg and an estimator  (Parrish's Y9) calculated as the weighted average of all sample  order statistics. This estimator has much greater computational  requirements than does Ys. and Parrish concluded this may  make Yg the most practical. We chose to evaluate only those  estimators that are relatively simple and easy to calculate.  Materials and methods  Data base description  The data used to evaluate the quantile estimation methods  were obtained from 92 installations eStablished by the Inter­mountain  Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative. The geographic  regions covered by these installations are central and north­eastern  Washington. northeastern Oregon. northern and central  Idaho. and western Montana. These installations were estab­lished  in even-aged and single-species Douglas-fir stands to  test effects of nitrogen fertilization regimes and represent a  broad range of second growth conditions. Most stands had  been thinned 5-12 years prior to installation establishment.  Each installation consists of six plots. two of which received  no fertilization treatments. Plot sizes ranged from 0.1 to  0.2 acres (l acre =00405 hal. The trees from the two control  plots were combined for the purposes of this analysis. All  trees were measured for diameter at 4.5 feet (I ft =0.305 m)  above ground level (DBH) to the nearest 0.01 inch. Table 2  summarizes some important characteristics of these installa­tions.  A more complete description of these data is given by  Moore and others (1983).  Methods  The three-parameter Weibull distribution (Weibull 1951)  has a probability density function (PDF) as follows:  (e)(x a)&lt;'-I [(x a)C] f(x) = b T exp - T  for a ::;; x &lt; 00  =0 elsewhere  where x is the Weibull random variable. a is the location  parameter (a ~ 0 and x ~ a). b is the scale parameter (b &gt; 0).  and c is lhe shape parameter (c &gt; 0). We used the method  proposed by zanakis (1979) to estimate the three parameters  using percentiles. This method utilizes x(l). x(2). and X(II) to  estimate lhe location parameter (a):  ,  ~ X(1)X(II) - X(2)  a =  x(I) + X(II) - 2X(2)  if X (2) -x(I) &lt;X(II) -x(2); otherwise a=x(I)' Th~ scale param­eter  (b) is estimated from the relationship a+ b =X63• where  X63 is the 63rd percentile of the Weibull distribution. The  shape parameter (e) is then estimated as  [  In(l - 0.97)]  In In(l - 0.17)  In[X9  7 - ~]  X17 - a  where X17 and X97 are the 17th and 97th percentiles. respec­tively.  of the Weibull distribution. Dubey (1967) showed the  17th and 97th percentiles provided the asymptotically most  efficient estimate of e.

This definition was recommended  and 95th percentiles, respectively. from the standard normal  distribution. Knoebel and Burkhart ( 1991 ) used x (I) - 0.5 and  x(,,) - x(1) + 1.5 to independently estimate the minimum and  range. respectively. We. therefore. chose the 50th and 95th  percentiles to estimate the two shape parameters given  Knoebel and Burkhart's estimates of the minimum and range.  The first step in our analysis was to estimate the 17th. 50th.  63rd, 95th, and 97th percentiles for each of the 92 installa­tions  using each of the eight sample quantile functions. For  each percentile and installation, pairwise differences and pair­wise  absolute differences were calculated among all eight  quantile estimates. These differences were averaged over all  92 installations for comparison and evaluation.  Next. using the appropriate percentiles and estimates for  the minimum and range as discussed above. we estimated the  parameters of both the Weibull and S8 distributions for each  installation by the method of percentiles. The predicted cumu­lative  distribution function (CDF using the parameters esti­mated  by the method of percentiles) was then compared with  the empirical CDF at each sample diameter for each installa­tion.  Our definition of the empirical CDF was  evaluation of different estimation methods for the Weibull  distribution.  The PDF of the Johnson' s S8 distribution (Johnson 1949)  can be expressed as  I(x) =[~J((x - E)(E'\ A - x) )  x exp{-1[y + 8 In(E : ~ ~ x )r}  for E &lt; x &lt; E + A  =0 elsewhere  where x is the SB random variable. Aand 8 &gt; O. -00 &lt; E&lt; 00.  and -00 &lt; y &lt; 00. The choice of percentiles for estimating the  parameters of the SB distribution is not clear. Typically. the  two shape parameters (rand 8) have been estimated following  independent estimates of the minimum (E) and range (A)  parameters (see for example. Knoebel and Burkhart (1991)  and Newberry and Burk (1985». Both of these studies used  the 50th and 95th percentiles to estimate the two shape param­eters  using the following system of equations:  Z50 = .y + 8X~i()  Z95 = .y + 8X95  where X50 and X95 are the 50th and 95th percentiles. respec­tively.  from the SB distribution and Z50 and Z95 are the 50th  .

(1983) since it closely approximates the  median of the distribution of X(I) for any continuous distribu­tion  where X(i) is the random variable associated with x(i). The  1/3 in the numerator and denominator is used to ensure that  x(n) is not considered the largest population value. The differ­ence  between the estimated cumulative probabilities of the  empirical and predicted distribution functions was calculated  at each sample diameter observation in an installation. The  average difference. average absolute difference. and maximum  difference were then determined for each installation. These  differences were averaged over all installations to determine  which quantile estimation method had the least error.  We divided the installations into three categories and repeated  the comparisons of the empirical and predicted distribution  functions in an attempt to assess whether certain distributional  shapes affect the choice of the quantile estimation function.  To this end. installations were categorized by the amount and  direction of distribution skewness. We used the skewness  classes of less than -0.20. -0.20 to 0.20. and greater than  0.20. Although the choice of these classes is somewhat arbi­trary.  it does separate the more highly negatively skewed  distributions from the more highly positively skewed distri­butions  and provides at least 10 installations in each category.  Results  The 17th. 50th. 63rd. 95th. and 97th percentiles were esti­mated  using each of the eight quantile functions. Tables 3 and  4 show the pairwise differences and pairwise absolute differ-ences.  respectively. among the eight quantile estimates aver­aged  over all 92 installations for each percentile. As we would  expect from our earlier analytical evaluations of the functions  in Table I. most of the average differences (relative to the  absolute differences) are in a particular direction (bias). The  differences among methods are. in general. greatest in the tails  of the distributions. Method Y6 estimates are most different  from the other methods for all five percentiles. For the 17th  percentile. the largest difference is 0.22 inches (I inch =  2.54 cm) between Y6 and Y3• Ys• and Y7• Methods Y6 and  Y7 have the largest difference of 0.14 inches for the 50th  percentile. For the 63rd. 95th. and 97th percentiles. Y4 and  Y6 have the largest differences of 0.17,0.79, and 1.24 inches.  respectively.  For estimating the median. Y2 and Y3 provide the same  estimate in all cases. This follows since Y2 and Y3 equal x(j)  for g =0 (n even) and x(j+ I) for g =0.5 (n odd). Methods  Y4, Ys, and Yg which give identical estimates of the median are  the only methods, out of the eight evaluated, which produce  median estimates consistent with the traditional definition.  Methods Y3• Ys• and Y7 yield the same estimates for the  17th. 63rd. and 97th percentiles since g '¢ 0 for these percen­tiles  and number of sample observations. This implies these  three methods will lead to the same parameter estimates for  the Weibull distribution using the method of percentiles.  However. estimates of the 50th and 95th percentiles are dif­ferent  among methods Y3, Ys, and Y7 and result in different  parameter estimates for the Sil distributions.  0.04 ..  0.04J:rr-------------------.

In general,  shape of the distribution did not greatly affect the ranking of  the quantile estimation methods for the Weibul1 distribution.  5H distribution  Methods Y., Y2, and Y3 have the smal1est average differ­ences  between the empirical and predicted Sn cumulative  distribution functions for the eight quantile estimation  methods. The three methods performed poorly with positively  skewed distributions.  The largest average differences were obtained with Y.. and  Y,. Recall that percentiles used to estimate the Sn parameters  in this study do not lead to identical distributions for methods  Y3, Ys, and Y,. All methods had more bias with the symmetric  distributions than with either negatively or positively skewed  distributions. Methods YI , Y2, and Yll have the smallest average  absolute differences with Yll being the most consistent across  all categories. Methods Yt and Y2 have larger differences with  the negatively skewed distributions as well as Y2 with the  symmetric distributions. The largest average absolute differ­ences  were associated with methods Y.. and Y"" although Y..  does quite well with negatively skewed distributions. Methods  YI , Y6, and Yg were best with respect to average maximum  differences. Again there was at least one category where the  perfonnance of each of these methods declined. Methods Y2  and Y3 produced the largest average absolute differences. As  with the Weibull distribution the estimators performed better  with the symmetric and positively skewed distributions.  For the S8 distribution, YI outperfonns the other methods.  Methods Y2 and Yg also have smaller differences. Similar to  its performance with the Weibull, Y6 has larger average dif­ferences  than most of the other methods. Method Y2 did poorly  for the average maximum differences. Methods Y.. and Y, had  the poorest performances for the Sn distribution. Similar to  the results for the Weibull, the selection of the best quantile  estimation method did not vary greatly with empirical dis­tributional  shapes; however, results were more variable for  the Sn distribution. Usually, the best overall methods had at  least one category with poorer than average differences.  Discussion and conclusions  The quantile estimation methods that performed best in this  evaluation were those that, in some manner, averaged two  adjacent order statistics. Methods Y1 and Yll performed quite  well for both the Weibull and S8 distributions. Method Yg  almost always had larger average differences than did Yt• The  results for YI were slightly more variable across the categories  evaluated than Ys. As we discussed earlier, Ys is consistent  with the traditional definition of the median; Y1 is not. Parzen  (1979) suggested Ys should work well for symmetric distri­butions  and Parrish (1990) lends evidence to this assertion.  Our evaluation suggests both methods work well for nonsym­metric  situations.  With the exception of average maximum differences for the  Sn distribution, method Y2 performed best of the methods  using one order statistic in their calculation. However, results  for Y2 were more highly influenced by distribution shape cat-egories.  Method Y6 did not perform as well with the Weibull  distribution as with the Sn distribution.  Our results show Y. and Yg are the best methods evaluated  for estimating quantiles from our sample-based order statis­tics.  It is our hope these results will be tested on other popu­lations  and the theoretical properties of these estimators will  be evaluated for the types of distributions commonly found  in forestry. We see no reason, however, why our results should  not apply to situations with similar distributions.

Disaggregating Stand Volume Growth to Individual Trees,"Zhang, L.; Moore, J.A.; Newberry, J.D.","A disaggregation function, relative size-growth (RSG), was proposed and developed for interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn] Franco) to distribute stand volume to a list of individual trees. The RSG function was formulated as a quadratic equation relating relative tree growth to relative tree size in a stand. The shape of the RSG function was linear, convex, or concave depending on initial stand conditions and structure. A recursive system of equations was developed to predict the three coefficients of the RSG function using initial stand density, mean tree size, and coefficient of variation of tree size distribution as predictor variables. This disaggregation function determines within-stand growth of individual trees and simulates stand development and dynamics. The RSG function provides a biologically based link between whole-stand and individual tree resolution models.",1993-05-01,yes,research (document genres); trees; statistics;,"Zhang, L., J.A.

MODEL DEVELOPMENT  DEFINITION OF THE RELATIVE SIZE-GROWTH FUNCTION  We assume that the dynamics of stand structure are affected by competitive  interactionsa mongin dividualsT. he growtho f an individuatlr ee is size-dependent.  The contributiono f an individuatlr ee's growtht o standt otal growth is propor-tional  to that tree's relative size in the stand. Relative tree growth (RTG) is  defineda s the ratioo f individuatrl ee volumeg rowtht o standt otalv olumeg rowth  (i.e., the sum of the individual trees) on a unit area. Relative tree size (RTS) is  defined as the ratio of individual tree volume to stand total volume on a unit area.  Relativet ree growthi s expresseda s a functiono f relativet ree size. The following  quadraticf unctionw as used to describet he relative size-growth( RSG) relation-ship:  RTG -= •3o + •3•* RTS + •32* RTS2 (1)  where [3o , [31,a nd [32a re coefficienttso be estimatedfo r eachp lot.

Althoughu singi ndependendt ata  MAY 1993/299  has several positive aspects, we chose to test the RSG function differently for  three reasons.

Plot Reconnaissance  1. Each installation will consist of 7 or 14 plots, depending on parent material,  vegetation series, and the fertilizer treatment to be applied, as detailed in the  IFfNC study plan. Each plot will consist of a growth plot (1/10 ac) inside of  a 1/2 ac plot, which is surrounded by a 20 foot buffer zone. The 1/2 ac plot  will be subdivided into 9 subplots. The growth plots will be used for periodic  growth remeasurement. The 1/2 ac plots will provide adequate space and  number of sample trees for future sampling of fertilized areas without  disturbing the growth plot. The subplots will be used for measurement of  regeneration (trees&gt; 4.5' tall and &lt; 2"" dbh) and tracking of disease pockets.  The buffer zone provides an additional ""safety zone"" and decreases edge  effects on the main plot.  2. At each site the desired number of plots to be established should be laid out  where site and stand factors are as unifonn as possible. The completed plot  should contain a minimum number of trees of each species (at least two  healthy dominants/codominants of each of two dominant species), of a  minimum diameter or greater. The number of trees and minimum diameter  will vary for each stand, and will be determined by IFTNC staff.  3. IFTNC field staff will ""flag"" tentative plots for each installation, preferably  before crew arrival. This procedure should be followed to be certain that all  \  2  plots can be established in the area under uniform conditions of aspect. slope.  soil. stand density. and species composition. The reconnaissance person  should use a hand compass to pace off the sides of each growth plot (66 feet  square). and place flagging at center and comers. A minimum of three chains  should be left between flagged growth plots to ensure sufficient space for  surrounding 112 ac plots and buffer strips. The trees per acre and species  composition. along with any additional comments. will be noted and passed on  to the field crew for plot establishment.  II. Plot Establishment  1. All 1110 ac (growth) plots will be established flISt. followed by the  corresponding 1/2 ac plots. subplots and buffer zones. In some stands we may  establish all of the growth plots before starting 1/2 ac plots in order to ensure  uniformity between the growth plots. The 112 ac plots are of secondary  priority for uniformity; we generally ""fit"" the 112 ac plots in where we can in  order to accommodate the growth plots. The IFTNC field crew will establish  the permanent plots by using staff compass and fiberglass measuring tape to  layout each 1110 ac plot. 1/2 ac plot. 9 subplots and buffer strip.  Measurements will be in horizontal distance rather than slope distance, so on  steep slopes a technique for ""breaking-chain"" or correcting for slope angle  must be employed to get the correct horizontal distance.  2. At each flagged location, a tentative growth plot should be established. and the  trees on the plot tallied. For the Tally procedure, one person will measure  3  diameters of all trees on the plot, one person will record diameters either on  the Initial Tally sheet (Figure 1) or on the Husky (using the TALLY program),  while other crew members stand on the comers and help the measuring person  keep track of the trees. At least three growth plots should be completed prior  to scooching (see below), to get an idea of the ""target"" basal area (BA) and  trees per acre (TPA) for the overall installation.  3. At this point ""Scoochingn may be necessary. Scooching refers to shifting the  growth plot a few feet in one direction or another in order to add or lose trees  in order to reach the target BA and TPA levels. Scooching may also be  employed in order to obtain the desired species composition. Once the  satisfactory BA, TPA and species composition have been attained for a growth  plot, comer stakes should be pounded in and the crew may proceed to  establishment of 1/2 ac, subplots and buffer zone.  4. Two common methods of setting up the 1/2 ac plot and buffers have been  developed and are shown in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows the ""Double  Comer Method, II which involves using one comer of the growth plot as a  comer for the 1/2 ac plot. Figure 3 shows the ""Double Center Method, ""  which involves using the center of the growth plot as plot center for the 1/2 ac  plot. For both methods, a convenient procedure is to place the staff compass  at growth plot center and layout growth plot comers from there. Then, (or  the Double Center Method, no further moving of the staff compass is  necessary; all 1/2 ac comers, buffer comers and subplot centers can also be  Plot Number  INITIAL TALLY SHEET  lnstallaIioD Name !DBR !sp: f sp: !sp: Isp: , Total Number IBasal ARa I  2  2.5  3  3.5  4  4.5  5  5.5  6  6.5  7  7.5  8 .  8.5  9  9.5  10 .  10.5  11  11.5  12  12.5  13  13.5  14  14.5  15  15.5  16  16.5  17  17.5  TOTAL  -ri~vre ~  Va.

For the Double Comer Method. the staff compass  needs to be moved once. from the growth plot center to the 1/2 ac plot center.  to fmish layout of the 1/2 ac comers, buffer comers and subplot centers.Stakes  should be set at growth plot center (4.5' gray stake). comers of growth plots.  1/2 ac plots. and buffer strips (2.5' gray stakes), and centers of the subplots  (2' white).  5. When the stakes have been set (pound them in tight) paint them and place a  stick with flagging in them using the following color scheme:  Growth plot comers - Yellow  Growth plot center - Yellow  1/2 ac plot comers - Blue  Buffer comers - Yellow  Double comers = 1/2 Blue, 1/2 Yellow  Subplot centers - do nothing  Also mark trees just outside the border with 2 short diagonal stripes on the  side facing the plot. These marks help indicate ""in"" and ""outll trees for  numbering and measurement, and also facilitate finding the boundaries when  we fertilize in the fall, especially in the snow!  6. Time-permitting. use the brush hook or hatchet to prune off all dead branches  on trees within the growth plot to a height of about six or seven feet.  7. Once all plots have been established for an installation, the plot locations  should be documented using the Plot Establishment Checklist forms (Figure 4),  F"":jLJre Lf  PLOT ESTABLISHMENT CHECKLIST  Plot  Installation Name----------- Installation Number__  Technician _  From Plot Center:  Date----  SLOPE _ ASPECT----  From 1/10 Ac.

Two persons are needed to record plot locations. One person  stands at the reference point or current growth plot center stake, and the other  goes to the next growth plot center stake. Calling out to each other, the fll'St  person (recorder) uses a hand compass and pacing to determine azimuth  anddistance to the person waiting at the next plot. While waiting for the  recorder, the other person should affix the red IFTNC tag and treatment tag to  the plot center stake. Upon arrival, the recorder gathers information requested  on forms, while the other person takes soil surface samples (See Section V.l).  The recorder must create a detailed sketch (See Section V.3) which will be  used help us fmd the plots in the future, and also indicates access points for  fall fertilizer application.  8. Information to be recorded at each plot includes:  a) Plot Establishment Checklists: slope, aspect, directions, plot sketch  b) Cover Percentages (Figure 5): shrubs, grasses/forbs, and bare ground.  Coverage codes are provided on the form.  c) Any other pertinent information  m. Tree Marking  1. All trees will be marked at dbh for fall measurement and future  remeasurements. A gray PVC stake with a black line at 4.5', or any stick  with a mark at 4.5', will be used as a guide to mark d.b.h. on the plot trees.  Locate the section of the stem representing d.b.h. (4.5 feet above the ground  on the upmLL side of the tree).

Carefully paint a horizontal band at the point where the  diameter will be taken. On the growth plot trees, yellow paint will be used,  and the band should extend all the way around the tree. On the 1/2 acre trees,  blue paint will be used and the band should extend about halfway around  thetree, clearly visible from the uphill side of the tree.  2. All trees will also be numbered just above the dbh mark in order to track  individual tree growth/mortality over the course of the study. Standing at the  center of the growth plot, face uphill and select the comer on the uphill left­hand  side to begin numbering. Paint a number on each tree at about eye level  on the uphill side of the tree. Number the trees systematically so that it is  easy to fmd the trees in consecutive order. Numbering for growth plots  should start at 1 on Plot I, and run continuously through all growth plots,  using yellow paint. Numbering for 1/2 acre trees will start over at 1 on each  subplot, and run continuously through that subplot only, using blue paint.  Include the subplot number (1 through 9) before the tree number. Subplots  will be numbered starting on the uphill, left-hand comer of the plot and run  consecutively.  5. At the time of numbering trees, each tree number and species should be  recorded on the Final Tally form (Figure 6) or on the Husky (using FINAL  program) in order to create a data me for fall measurements.

If a snag, solid log or exposed rock is present near the growth plot center,  paint the plot number to identify the plot on successive visits (Le. ""Plot 2"").  Repeat this procedure at the edge of the road nearest the plot area, making the  number readily visible from the road.  2. Place several of the red IFTNC signs in the area, particularly near the 1st plot  encountered when entering the installation, and at any visible, central points  within the installation. Avoid putting them on live trees.  3. Draw a map of the area using the Installation Sketch (Figure 7). Include the  contour of the road near the plots (curves, turnouts, etc.) and spur roads that  might aid in fmding the plot area. Also include ridges, draws, any dominant  features in the area near the plots, and of course, the plots. Indicate azimuths  and distances between plots and a reference point from the road to at least one  plot. The map need be only hand drawn, but should be accurate enough that  anyone can fmd the plot once they are in the area.  V Other Data Collection  1. Surface Soil Sampling: One sample will be collected from each plot using the  soil auger. The sample will be taken from the upper 10"" of mineral soil near  the growth plot center. Before taking the core sample, remove any litter or  duff from the soil surface. Avoid taking the sample where trees are decaying  where there are other irregularities. Composite all samples for the installation  in a bucket and mix them. Remove a sample from the bucket and place it in a  rl~u,e T  INSTALLATION SKETCH (NK Surface Response. 14 Plots)  Installation Number Date-----  Installation Name---------- Technician-------  300N/400K (21.5)  512.

Soil Pit Sampling: At each site, dig a pit down to bedrock, hardpan,  restrictive layer, or to unaltered parent material, whichever comes fIrSt. Using  the Soil ProfIle Description (Figure 8), describe the soil horizons present, the  depths of each, and the characteristics of the peds in each horizon. Note any  soil characteristics that may be pertinent to understanding the quality of the  site. Include any surface ash layer in the comments.  3. Vegetative Abundance: For each plot carefully observe the vegetation present  within the plot boundaries. On the form provided (Figure 9), note the relative  abundance of each species present, including trees, shrubs, grasses and forbs.  If you observe species on the plot that are not listed on the form, write them  in the spaces provided. If some species are present which you cannot identify  but which are relatively abundant throughout the stand, collect and press them.  Fill out ID sheets for each species collected. Temporarily give this species a  code name, record it on the vegetative description sheet and record its  abundance on each plot. After identification change the code name to the  species name.  4. Habitat Type: Habitat type or plant association should be determined using  information on vegetative abundance, soils, slope, aspect, elevation and other  necessary information. This determination should be made using a manual  specific to the region. Record habitat type on the Vegetative Abundance form  StaDd No Local Feature Photo No  , .. Plot No Plot No  .

VI. Installation Information  1. Provide as much information as possible about the stand, using the Installation  Checklist (Figure 10).  2. Provide written directions to the plot area from a prominent place on an area  map (Le. specific place in a town or a major road intersection that can be  easily found by anyone with little knowledge of the area). Provide mileage  estimates to road intersections or prominent features so that anyone with the  directions can locate the plot area.  4. Record the name of the nearest local feature to the plot area (Le. Deer Creek,  Thompson Butte, Johnson's Mill, etc.). This will be the name that applies to  this site.  S. If possible, locate the position of the plot area to the nearest quarter-section,  using a topographic quadrangle. Record the township, range, section and  subsection. Also include ownership, soils information, and other information  requested on the Installation Checklist.  6. If the crew must leave the installation before completing all of the above steps,  then note ALL remaining tasks on the TO DO CHECKLIST (Figure 11).  ~STALLATIONCHECKL~T  (To be completed before leaving site)  Installation Name----------- Number of Plots---  O~e~mp __  Installation Number---  Date Completed _  Region-----------  Contacts:  Legal Description: (T)  Instructions for how to arrive:  (R) (S)  Ash Depth (in) _  Vegetation & Soil Information  Habitat Type  Parent Material  Soil-forming Process _  Soil Depth (in) _  Tasks completed:  Stakes placed & painted  Boundaries marked  Growth plot center stakes  IFTNC red tags  Subplot center stakes  Final tallies completed  Tree numbers painted(1I10) __  Tree numbers painted (112)  Soil samples  Plot numbers by roads  Forms completed:  Plot Establishment (14)__  Installation Sketch  Cover Percentages  Vegetation List  Soil Pit  To Do List  Initial Tally (14)  Final Tally (14)  TO BE COMPLETED  1995 Installations  INSTALLATION NUMBER:__  General jobs:  PLOT: JOB:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  Other instructions. comments:  NAME: ------------  21  VIT. Initial Tree Measurements  1. Initial tree measurements will be taken in the fall of the year of installation.  Using the IFTNC2 program on the Husky data recorder, record the following  information for each tree, using the codes shown in Figure 12:  a. Tree number (should be in the startup data set)  b. Species (should also be in the startup data set; if not use number codes  for species)  c. Crown Ratio for trees being measured by height pole rather than  clinometer (generally trees less than 20' tall, or  deformedlsweepyIleaning trees).  d. Management codes and defects  e. Diameter of the tree at the painted dbh line. Record this diameter to  the nearest 1/100 inch. Make sure the D-tape is straight and that no  debris is wedged between the tape and the tree.  f. Height is automatically calculated by the Husky using the following  four angles (measured in percent with a Suunto clinometer): Top  Height, Misc. Angle (greater than dbh but less than top height), Base  of Live Crown, and DBH line. Also enter distance to the tree, using  measuring tape or Sonins to obtain horizontal distance from clinometer  to the center of the tree. The data recorder person should inform the  clinometer person of the resultant tree height, to try and screen out  incorrect measurements.

Also at this time. any tasks which were not accomplished during the  installation process should be completed. These tasks may be found on the TO  DO form (see VI.6).  vm. Fertilization  1. Determine the exact amount of fertilizer compound needed for each plot by  multiplying the number of pounds per acre to be applied by the total plot size  (.8 ac). Then divide this number by the percentage of element in the fertilizer  compound (46% N in urea, 60%K in potash, 50% K20 in potassium  sulphate). This gives the total pounds of each fertilizer compound to be  delivered to the plot; divide this number by 50 to get the number of 50# bags  required for that plot.  2. Hand spreaders will be used to spread the fertilizer over the plot. Subdivide  the plot according to growth plot, remaining 1/2 ac plot, and buffer zone. The  growth plot will receive 1/8 of the total fertilizer, the remaining 1/2 ac plot  will receive 4/8 of the fertilizer, and the buffer strip gets the rest (3/8 of the  fertilizer). Apply the fertilizer as evenly as possible over the entire plot.  Until precision in applying the fertilizer is gained, it is best to begin  conservatively. going over each area several times if necessary. This would  avoid the possibility of running out of fertilizer before fInishing the plot.  3. Record the fertilizer treatment and weather conditions at time of application on  the Treatment Checklist (Figure 13).  24  TREATMENT CHECKLIST  (N Rate and N-K Response Surface Experiments)  Installation Name:  Installation Number:  Plots Fertilized  Plot Treatment  I  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  Weather Conditions  Treatments:  (I4-Plot): N-K Resp.

Nitrogen and Potassium Concentrations after Fertilization on Mixed Conifer Stands in North Central Washington,"Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.","Post fertilization foliar nitrogen and potassium concentrations and needle weights were examined for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii), lodgepole pine (pinus contorta) and ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa) in north central Washington. Foliar nitrogen concentration was found to increase and foliar potassium concentration to remain the same or decrease following fertilization. Lodgepole pine showed the most efficient uptake for both nitrogen and potassium. Potassium to nitrogen ratios decreased following treatment. Needle weights for lodgepole pine  increased following fertilization. Foliar magnesium, boron, iron and zinc levels were also examined for lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine occurring on pumice soils versus glacial till soils. Response to treatment varied widely, but expected nutrient deficiencies due to pumice soils did not materialize except for lodgepole pine magnesium levels on untreated plots. Boron and iron showed unexpected increases on pumice soils following combined nitrogen and potassium treatment, leading us to suspect that some other soil layer may underlie the pumice soil.",1995-04-01,yes,research (document genres); forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,"Garrison, M.T., and J.A.

In this paper we present evidence supporting the premise that forest nutrition, nutrient cycling and nutrient manage­ment are critical factors for the health of Inland Western forests and for management of the ecosystems. The current state of knowledge suggests that inadequate tree nutrition, particularly potassium short­age, influences tree chemistry such that inadequate plant defensive compounds are produced. Pathogens and insects are unusually suc­cessful in attacking such trees. Forest managers have substantial influence on the forest nutritional environment through nearly all types of silvicultural treatments.  INTRODUCTION  In this paper we summarize evidence supporting the premise that nutri­tion, nutrient cycling and nutrient management are critical factors to con­sider when assessing Inland Western forest health and ecosystem manage­ment.

Moore  eral nutrient deficiency and consequent implications for Inland Western forest ecosystem heallh. We agree that carbon and nitrogen are key nutri­ent elements (Harvey et al. 1994) but we also strongly suggest that other inorganic nutrient elements should be recognized as significant determi­nants of plant, and therefore forest ecosystem, vigor. We will describe results implicating potassium as an example of a critical ""other element."" We will also explore how human intervention, by design or not, can affect forest nutrient reserves and consequently inland forest health (Harvey et al. 1989). We presume that the nutritional status of inland forests is outside the historic range of variation since nutrient deficiencies are universal in the region (Mika et al. 1992) and humans have recently excluded fire from forest ecosystems and have often displaced or otherwise removed nutri­ents during harvesting or silvicultural activities. A more detailed under­standing of all the relationships between mineral nutrient status and cur­rent forest health status is beyond the scope of this paper and would require more speculation than lhe authors are comfortable with. We there­fore will concentrate on the research needed to improve our basis for understanding these relationships.  OVERVIEW OF NUTRITIONAL PROCESSES  Nutrient Requirements ofPlants  An essential inorganic nutrient element for plants is defined as an ele­ment required to complete its life cycle. The common list of essential inorganic nutrient elements for green plants includes Carbon(C), Hydrogen(H), Oxygcn(O), Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus(P), Potassium(K), Sulfur(S), Cal­cium(Ca), Magnesium(Mg), Iron(Fe), Manganese(Mn), Molybdenum(Mo), Copper(Cu), Boron(B), Zinc(Zn), Cobalt(Co) and Chlorine(Cl). Other ele­ments such as Sodium (Na), Silicon(Si) or Selenium(Se) have also been demonstrated to be necessary for some plant and animal species.  Concepts ofNutrient Deficiency and Sufficiency  Plants fundamentally are""fixers"" of atmospheric carbon. Plants create building block carbon, hydrogen and oxygen molecules and in the process ""split"" water, releasing oxygen. Forest process models typically use nitro­gen reserves in forest ecosystems as a key variable to represent the poten­tial for plant and ecosystem function, vigor and productivity. The relation­ship or ratio between inorganic nutrient elements such as nitrogen to the quantity of carbon (biomass) that can be fixed (Running and Gower 1991) /94 ASSESSING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST  is used along with other primary growth factors such as light, oxygen, water, and heat in these process models to predict the ability of a site to fix carbon. In addition to carbon/nitrogen, the relationships between all essen­tial inorganic nutrient elements can be expressed as critical nutrient ratios (Ingestad 1979). Later in this paper we will give examples of the nitrogen! potassium relationships we have been exploring. Since quantities and ratios of 16 or more elements can influence carbon fixation, it is reason­able that inorganic elements can strongly influence plant, and therefore ecosystem, function in a profound manner. Typically though, only a few inorganic nutrient elements limit carbon assimilation and allocation on most individual sites.  Inorganic Plant Nutrients in Inland Forest Ecosystems  The nutrient capital of a forested site is contained in the soil, living and dead plants and animals (Tomlinson and Tomlinson 1990; Buol et al. 1989). The soil fonning factors are climate, parent materials, organisms, relief and time, and maybe subsequently indentified human activity. Soils of the Inland West are predominantly young in the time scales of soil formation, primarily because of a relatively recent geologic history of glacial, interglacial, and volcanic activity. Because of the relatively cool and dry climate, mineral weathering and soil development processes occur slowly and the steep terrain limits soil profile development. Current soil properties of the Inland West, including the ability to supply nutrients, are therefore predominantly a function of the accumulated soil organic matter and the relatively unaltered soil parent material reflecting the rock, miner­als and geomorphic processes from which the soil profiles were devel­oped. Nitrogen is the only essential inorganic element which is fixed from the atmosphere by plants and microorganisms predominantly on site. Oth­er removals and additions to the nutrient capital occur mostly through precipitation, wind transport, leaching and soil movement.  Brockley et al. (1992), state that""... inadequate nutrition is character­istic of many forests of the Interior Northwest Nitrogen deficiencies are widespread and serious enough to dominate nutrient management con­cerns. On many sites, forest management activities and recurring wildfires may exacerbate existing nutritional problems. Because a large proportion of site nutrients may be contained in the forest floor and surface mineral soil, many interior forest soils-those where organic matter is produced, recycled, or replaced very slowly (e.g., dry, cold or fire-&lt;lamaged sites)-are vulnerable to harvesting or site preparation practices that remove or dis­place surface organic layers and nutrient rich topsoil (Jurgensen et al. 1990).""

Nutritiollallmplicatiolls ofEcosystem Disturbance atUf Recovery  In the discussion above, location and compartmentalization of inorgan­ic nutrients in the living and dead biomass and soil was described. This is a dynamic process with nutrient transfers occurring in a process termed nutri­ent cycling (Cole et al. 1967). It is clear that among other effects, nutrient cycling often occurs in ways uncommon in presettlement conditions. These effects can be characterized, at least at this time, as abnonnallack of disturbance. Large volumes of standing live and dead biomass contain much of the inorganic nutrients previously held in the soil, or in the case of nitrogen, there may be higher quantities stored than in conditions receiv­ing regular disturbance (McDonald 1993; Cochran and Hopkins 1991).  Fire-Fire is the primary carbon and inorganic nutrient recycling agent for the majority of forest types in the Inland West (Harvey et al. 1992; Arno 1988). Most nutrient elements are non-volatile; that is, they remain behind in ash (except perhaps in very hot bums of long duration). Nitrogen is volatilized during combustion and is returned to the atmosphere primar­ily as nitrogen oxides. The greatest risks to nutrient reserves as a conse­quence of fire are excessive nitrogen volatilization and the potential ero­sion of nutrient rich ash after very intense fire events.  Windthrow-Windthrow itself does not have a large impact on nutrient reserves since nutrients are returned through decomposition. The danger in the Inland West, though, is that a fire in the resulting downed and heavy fuels can be very intense, leading to excessive soil heating and to the loss of nitrogen and soil organic matter.  Harvesting & Slash Disposal-Effects of harvesting and slash disposal vary widely, depending on site conditions and the specific site treatments. The key point to remember is that nutrients are most concentrated in the fine branches and needles. Bole wood (logs) are relatively low in nutrient content. Whole tree harvesting is a process by which whole trees and attached crowns are transported to landings for processing and disposaL This process can result in significant export of nutrients, which ultimately may need to be replaced by fertilization. Follow-up slash disposal can have a great impact on nutrient capital as well, particularly if very intense slash fires volatilize nitrogen from the slash, duff and upper soil horizons. Dozer and windthrow piling, prior to burning, localizes nutrients, making access to nutrients for the next stand unevenly distributed. Brockley et al. (1992) and Kimmins (1977) provide comprehensive reviews of these topics.  Insects-Insect effects depend on the severity of the infestation and 196 ASSESSING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST  consequent level of tree mortality. In a mass mortality event, such as by pine bark beetles, effects on nutrient capital can be compared to wind­throw mortality. Defoliation episodes result in accelerated nutrient recycl­ing as nutrient rich foliage is returned to the forest floor as fecal material. Again; no severe loss of nutrient capital may occur, particularly if under­story plants and recovering trees quickly reabsorb nutrients.  Root disease-Root disease effects on nutrient capital are relatively un­dramatic. Mortality occurs at a relatively low rate and is often quite local­ized such as in Armillaria root disease centers.  Current Conditions and Studier  Nitrogen concentration in foliage of inland conifers is apparently inade­quate for optimum forest growth, based on results in almost all studies completed (Moore et al. 1991; Shafii et al. 1989; Brockley et al. 1992). In addition to the prevailing nitrogen deficiency, potassium (Mika and Moore 1991), sulfur, and micronutrients-particularly boron, iron and magnesium­have also been suggested as deficient on some sites. This list will likely be expanded as investigations continue.  Nutrient and Water Stress Relationships: Insightrfrom Fertilizer and Herbicide Treatments  Soil moisture deficits are clearly another significant limiting factor for growth of inland forests. Data from Montana trials (Mandzak, unpub­lished), including combinations of herbicide and fertilization treatments, indicate that nutrient status influences water relations and that competition with understory plants affects both water status and foliar nutrient content. Figure I shows predawn moisture stress at a typical installation for herbi­cide removal of competing vegetation (PRONONE), fertilization with a ""complete"" fertilizer mix, a combined ""weed and feed"" treatment and no treatment options. Predawn moisture stress in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) stand with a well developed grass and low shrub un­derstory is lowest for the herbicide and greatest for the control treatment, thus indicating substantial interspecies competition for water. It is espe­cially interesting that moisture stress is low after the fertilizer treatment, in spite of substantial increases in conifer foliage and understory biomass. The increased potential for evapotranspiration resulting from the increase in leaf area is presumed to be offset by improvements in plant water control, such as through turgor pressure adjustments and stomatal control. Water potential was intermediate with the combined fertilizer and herbi­cide treatment.

These installa­tions are displayed from left to right on the graph in ascending order of control foliar nitrogen. Note that herbicide control of the understory usual­ly resulted in increased foliar nitrogen concentration, suggesting a signifi­cant reduction in competition for nutrients. Substantial tree growth re­sponse was measured after two years for all treatments. Similar effects occur with other elements such as potassium. Smethurist et al. (1993) reported similar results for slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii) in Florida. Understory plants may have a significant role in nutrient cycl­ing; however, other than for N-fixation, nutritional ecology of the under­story has been little studied.  Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative Studies  The Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative located at the University of Idaho was organized partially around the presumption that a 198 ASSESSING rVJ&lt;/!,.H L:,\""V.&gt;.1 'H .lJ,.~ ""AJ'~••' •.. _  FIGURE 2.

Figure 3 shows average dormant season foliar N concentrations for various com­binations of geographic region and fertilizer treatments within the Inland West. The results show that the presumption of nitrogen deficiency was correct and that nitrogen fertilizer was taken up by the trees, resulting in increased foliar concentrations. Growth rates were also shown to increase significantly for all study regions. While a general dosage-dependent growth response was obtained, some installations produced little or no response, in spite of nitrogen uptake and deficiency.  In an effort to explain why some installations did not respond, pre-and post-treatment tree nutritional status was examined more closely. Evi­dence pointed to potassium as a nutrient potentially in low supply.

Furthermore, post-treatment tree mortality was related to pre-treatment foliar potassium status. While gross growth response was about equal regardless of K nutrition status, net (after mortality) response was greatly reduced on sites with poor pre-treatment K status (Figure 5). This work is reported in detail in Mika and Moore (1991).  In 1987, six fertilizer trials were established in ponderosa pine stands in western Montana. By that time, interest had developed in the potassium­nitrogen relationship such that the IFTNC decided to substitute a nitrogen plus potassium treatment for the higher nitrogen rate treatment that had been standard for the regional ponderosa pine experiment. After four years, two very interesting responses resulted. First, mortality was higher in the plots treated with 200 pounds per acre of nitrogen as urea (200N) than in the 200N + 200K plots. In fact, three of the six installations had ------------'-',,­200  ASSESSING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST 90 N TREATMENT: --0 Ib/ac -200Ib/ac -400Ib/ac / / 70 / I ( /, , I I J / I ( J I J I / I I / r 5030 0.4 0.0 -+--.:..­__~-----+----.J'----.--------l..--_____.----10 0.2 0.8 0.6 1.0 ---.----------r-----=::;;;;;;;o,----::::===;;=~---______, KIN RATIO (%) CUMULATIVE IFREQUENCY FIGURE 4.

Even more interesting was that mountain pine beetles (Dendroctanus ponderosa Dougl.) were the primary cause of mortality, and their activities were concentrated in the nitrogen only plots. No trees were lost to beetles in the N + K plots (Figure 7). This work is reported in Mika et al. (1994). Follow-up investigations continue to elucidate what mechanisms ""pro­tected"" the trees in the N + K plots. A paLLern is emerging that indicates potassium deficiency causes inadequate chemical defense compounds to be produced when nitrogen alone is used. There is considerable evidence from agricultural studies documenting a link between plant nutrition, chemistry and incidence of insects or diseases (Huber and Amy 1985).

The mortality was greatest in installations with poor foliar K status and in plots with 400 N treatments when compared with those sites having good pre-treatment foliar K status.  Work by Entry et al. (1991) may explain the physiological basis for the root rot mortality and for favorable N + K fertilization results. They investi­gated some previously installed fertilizer trials in northern Idaho and in­oculated trees located in the treatments with Armillaria root rot. They found that fertilizer-induced Armillaria infection was greatest on thinned and nitrogen fertilized plots and that it was related to root chemistry. Tree roots from thinned-only stands contained high concentrations of phenols and low sugar concentrations while nitrogen fertilized trees had high root sugar concentrations. The ratio of phenols to sugars was strongly corre­202  ASSESSING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST 0.0 -;---r---.--..,..--..---t---,,..----.----r-----l -350 -280 -210 -140 -70 0 70 140 210 Net Volume Response (ft3 ac·') . .....--------------­---.... -----­·)lE·N + K ~ ... ftnlu ~~~ --------r-------­I I I---------------+--­, I I 1.0 &gt;. u c ~ 0.8 IT (1) (1) &gt; L +J LL 0.6 ltl (1) -&gt; &lt;lJ 0: +J 0.4 ltl :J E :J 0.2 u lated to incidence of Armillaria infection (Figure 9). Several IFfNC coop­erators established nutrition experiments including combinations of nitro­gen and potassium fertilizer treatments in Douglas-fir stands with active Armillaria infestation. Four years after the fertilizer treatments were ap­plied, root samples were collected and analyzed using methods similar to Entry et al. (1991). The root phenol/sugar ratios by treatment are provided in Figure 10. These ratios are proportional to Entry et al.'s values shown in Figure 9. Potassium treatments significantly increased the root phenol/ sugar ratio. Given that a high ratio is bad for the fungus and good for the trees, this experiment demonstrates that it may be possible to change tree root chemistry to the detriment of Armillaria by manipulating tree nutri­tional status (Moore et al. 1993).

(1987) suggested that in mountain hemlock stands of the Oregon cascades, increases in nutrient availability and light, following death of the mature forest caused by the root rot fungus Phellinus weirii (MuIT.) Gilbeatson, increased resistance of young replacement trees to infection by the pathogen. Dmitri (1977) stated that ""As in human or veterinary medicine insufficient or excess nutrition of forest plants often leads to disease."" Arbitrary fertilizer dressings, often applied without prior soil or needle analysis, may have more negative than positive results. But there is impressive evidence that stand improvement and fertilizer applications according to site, tree species and stand age can contribute to increasing ""ecological resistance and health of the system."" Garraway (1975) helped elucidate the effects of root chemistry on Armil­laria mellea (Vah1:Fr.)

Other Investigations  Investigation of the relationships between defoliating insects and tree nutrient status and physiological defense mechanisms has been pursued to some extent. Mason et aL (1992) fertilized Douglas-fir and grand fir (Abies grandis [Dougl] Forbes) stands with nitrogen during a period of heavy infestation by spruce budworm (Christoneura occidentalis Free­man). They found that both populations and individual spruce budworm larvae increased in size. The trees, though, responded by producing more foliage and increased stem growth, tlIus indicating compensation by fertilization for defoliation effects. Waring et al.

Clancy et al. (1988) investigated the effect of seasonal and interspecific variation in foliar nutrients on spruce budworm performance. They suggest that foliar nutrition may be a key factor in budworm feeding behavior. Joseph et al. (1993), working with gypsy moth (Lyman tria dispar L.) feeding on Douglas-fir in Oregon, found that increased foliar nitrogen improved larval growth and survival. However, high phenolics were shown to be lethal to gypsy moth larvae. Chiu et al. (1992) investigated Douglas-fir I needles from treated and untreated IFfNC plots. Nitrogen and potassium  I  l treatments usually changed foliage color from green to a blue green (glaucous). It was found that the epicuticular wax changed to a different  ~  tubular, ornate morphology (waxes are phenolic compounds). Such  I  structures may have beneficial effects on resistance to sunscald, to water  j  loss and to pests.  .~  j ¥  206 ASSESSING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN THE INLAND WEST  FIGURE 10.

Followups ofExisting Nutrition Trials. Much has been learned from IFfNC and other fertilizer trials in this and other regions. The origi­nal focus of these efforts was timber production. but they are well designed forest nutrition experiments and we can make many infer­ences for forest health ramifications of nutrition management.  2.  Designsfor Future Nutrition IForest Health Studies. IFTNC has now developed installation designs that will help us understand the po­tential of forest nutrition management to deal with Armillaria root disease. bark beetles and other mortality causing agents. Optimum 207  3.rs  rom  -lgl­\  vell Jer­:  lOW  po­root lum  John M. Mandzak and James A. Moore  nutrition trials (response surfaces) are a planned first step. This ef­fort should be expanded.  3.  Inland Western Nutrient Cycling Studies. Basic nutrient cycling studies are needed across a variety of sites, especially those experi­encing health problems.  4.  Genetics in Forest Nutrition. One issue in forest health is the loss of seral species from our forest communities. We need more infonnation regarding how these species shifts affect nutrient cycling and the im­plications of those changes for forest health. Also, perhaps most im­portantly, it is recognized that there is substantial genetic control of nutrient uptake at both the species and intraspecific levels. More work is needed in this area of genetic/nutrition/forest health ecology.  5. Collaborative Studies Between Forest Pathologists, Entomologists, Geneticists, and Physiologists with Forest Nutrition and Soil Scien­tists. We feel that we have given some good examples of successful cross discipline efforts and strongly suggest that more be undertaken.  CONCLUSIONS  We must decide how, in managing forest ecosystems and their health in this Region, we can utilize what we have learned about forest nutrition. We have several suggestions for immediate application to forest management operations including forest harvesting, thinning, fertilization and pre­scribed fire. Nutrients should be conserved, particularly on nutrient poor sites, by learning tree foliage and branches on the site; fire should be reintroduced where possible and appropriate; and sometimes site nutrient capital will need to be restored through forest fertilization. We feel that a fundamental understanding of forest nutrition will be integral to develop­ing effective solutions to the Inland Western forest health problems.  REFERENCES  Adams, D.L and L.

Moore  Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative  University of Idaho  March 27, 1995  1  Four Year Response to Nand K Fertilization for  Douglas-fir in South-Central Washington (Klickitat)  SUMMARY  Four years after fertilizer treatments were applied, the average gross rf volume per  acre increased 13% on those plots receiving 200 lb. nitrogen (N) acre and 10% on those  plots receiving 200 lb. N acre plus 200 lb. potassium (K) acre. Absolute and relative gross  and net volume response show similar treatment effects. The addition of K in the fertilizer  mix did not directly increase volume growth over the controls, but K did decrease  mortality. In addition, results from this study show that K significantly irrcreased tree  height growth.  Methods  Study Area  The study area is located on the east slopes of the Cascade Mountains in the  Klickitat area of south-central Washington. Th~ cooperative fertilization project is located  on private and state lands in the Klickitat region. The land owners are: Champion  Timberlands, Longview Fibre and Washington Dept. Natural Resources. Appendix A.  shows regional and area installation locations in south-central Washington.  Design and Treatments  The six study sites (36 piots) were established in October, 1990 and consist of six  square 0.1 acre plots. The plots were grouped into two blocks of three plots each, based on  tree and site similarities and by treatment. Fertilization treatments were control, 200 lb. N  /acre and 200 lb. N/acre plus 200 lb. Klacre. Nitrogen was applied in the urea form and K  in the murate of potash form. All live trees larger than 3 inches in diameter were tagged  2  and then measured for total height and diameter. Site characteristics and tree measurements  were taken before the application of the treatments. Diameters were measured every two  years after treatment, while heights were measured four years after treatment. In addition,  any incidence of damage or mortality along with probable cause was noted. Foliage  samples were collected from the upper crown of the two dominant or codominant trees on  each plot in the Fall, 1991 and analyzed by Camas Analytical Lab, Missoula, Montana.  Detailed information for each installation on foliar nutrient levels one year after treatment  and on stand characteristics at time of establishment, two years and four years after  treatment are provided in Appendix B and C. Tree volumes were estimated using regional  species-specific volume equations from Prognosis Model (Wykoff, 1982).  Data Analysis  Relative and relative periodic annual volume increment (PAI) growth was calculated  using these two formulas:  %Growth Growth Xl00  Volumeo  %PAI= PAl X100  Volumeo  The experimental design model used for the four-year net and gross volume growth  and response took the general form of a covariate model:  Growth = F (Installation, ~lock, Treatment, BAo)  where: Growth - net and gross volume (cu. ftlacre)  BAO - initial basal area as a covariate variable  General linear contrasts and differences between means by treatment for the volume  growth were determined by using the least-squares routine of the general linear models  procedure (PROC GLM) of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute Inc. 1985).  The analysis of variance for absolute, relative and relative periodic gross and net  volume growth and response, plus height growth and response are given in Tables 1, 2, 3  and 4. The contrasts between treatment means are considered as average growth responses  to the treatments. The growth responses are smoothed estimates which are adjusted for a  common initial basal area of 192 rr/acre.  Table 1.

The K gross volume growth  response (-2.4%) was insignificantly negative (Figure la). For net volume response, the  difference between the two fertilizer treatments was not statistically significant.

The results for relative volume response (expressing the growth as a percentage of  the initial volume) on the Douglas-fIr sites parallel the absolute results (Table 2). Relative  response to the N alone treatment was higher for gross volume but lower for net volume  than the N plus K treatment (Figure 2). Although the differences between treatments were  not significant, the results agree with the Douglas-fIr ""regionwide"" trials showing  relationships between K and mortality rates within stands.

Gross relative periodic growth response to the fertilizer treatments was significant (p  :s 0.10) for both two-year growth periods after fertilization (Table 3). Relative gross  volume response was nearly 4%. higher on the N alone treatments and 1.6% higher on the  N plus K treatments in years 3 and 4 than in years 1 and 2 (Figure 3a).

Interestingly the addition of K to the fertilizer mix did not produce any effect on  gross or net growth, but it did produce a significant four-year average height growth  response (Figure 4). Height growth response was 7.3% on the N alone treatment and  14.2% on the N plus K treatment; however, the response differences between the two  treatments was not significantly different, the addition of K to the fertilizer mix tended to  increase height growth (Table 4).  8  9  Table 4.

Four-year average height response to N and K fertilization for Douglas-fIr sites in  Klickitat area, south-central Washington.  Although K may not have a direct affect on growth (McDonald, 1991), the trend for K  treated plots to have higher height growth could be attributed to indirect K influences.  10  Potassium affects many plant processes (such as water relations, production of defensive  compounds or carbohydrate transport) other than photosynthesis. Including K along with N  may have increased height growth through indirect means such as improved water use  efficiency.  The results from the Klickitat Douglas-fir sites show that volume growth was  significantly increased by nitrogen fertilization. However, these sites did not respond as  much as other IFTNC sites in the central Washington region. Potassium fertilization  decreased mortality rates, although not significantly, and increased height growth over a  four-year period after treatment.  Literature Cited  McDonald, AJ.S., T.

Geochemical analyses are obtained by crushing and analyzing a rock, and they provide  the chemical composition of rocks by oxides. Mineralogical descriptions are the result of slicing  thin sections and performing grain counts of various minerals in the rock under microscopic  examination.  The preferred means of classifying parent materials for rock content is by results of on-site  geochemical analyses, which provide a direct estimate of K2O in the rock. If on-site geochemical  information is available, the next preference would be the use of geochemical analysis from a local  equivalent rock type. If local information is not available, several sources of world-wide averages  may be consulted (Nockolds 1954 for igneous, Pettijohn 1987 for sedimentary, Dutro et al. 1983 for  igneous and sedimentary).  If geochemical analyses are not available, then mineralogical descriptions may be used by  calculating the K2O content of the various minerals. A procedure for doing this is provided in the  original report. If neither mineralogical description nor geochemical analysis is available, then the  rock nomenclature may be used. Care must be taken when estimating potassium content by  nomenclature alone, because different geologists may call the same rock by different names, or  different rocks by the same name; in other words the available nomenclature systems are extremely  variable.  Following are the IFTNC breakdown by nomenclature and a section on conversion of  mineralogical modes to K2O percentage.  2  HIGH-K ROCKS: K2O &gt; 3.50 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Igneous Rocks  Plutonic Volcanic  Nepheline syenite Phonolite  Alkali granites, syenites Alkali rhyolites, trachytes  Granite Rhyolite  Quartz syenite Quartz trachyte  Syenite Trachyte  Monzonite Latite  MEDIUM-K ROCKS: K2O 1.76-3.50 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Igneous Rocks  Plutonic Volcanic  Some lower-K granites Rhyodacite  Quartz monzonite Quartz latite  Granodiorite Dacite  Quartz diorites Latite-andesites  Monzodiorite, diorite Latite-basalt  Sedimentary Rocks  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Mudstones Graywackes; K-clays (illite, sericite, phlogopite, biotite) predominant,  or era Paleozoic and earlier, OR no other information available  Clayey Sandstones Arkose, graywackes; modifiers micaceous, arkosic, feldspathic, lithic  Volcanic Rhyolitic detritus & tuffs  Metamorphic Rocks (partial list)  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Meta-mudstones Argillite, slate, siltite  Metamorphics Schists, phyllites, gneisses, etc., WITH modifiers indicating the  presence of high-K minerals: biotite, muscovite, phlogopite, K-feldspars)  3  LOW-K ROCKS: K20 &lt;= 1.75 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Igneous Rocks  Plutonic Volcanic  Tonalite Quartz andesite  Low-K quartz diorites Andesite  Gabbro, Anorthosite Basalt  Peridotite, Pyroxenite  Sedimentary Rocks  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Mudstones Graywackes, subgraywackes; K-clays not predominant, modifiers  carbonaceous, siliceous  Sandstones Arenite, quartzarenite; modifier quartz; anything with the prefix sub-  (this indicates a high quartz percentage); OR no other  information available  Undefined detritus Conglomerates, breccias, agglomerates, tuffs, tills  Volcanic Andesitic detritus & tuffs  Carbonate rocks Limestone, dolomite  Chemical precipitates Ironstones, evaporates, chert  Metamorphic Rocks (partial list)  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Meta-sandstones Quartzites  Metamorphics Schists, phyllites, gneisses, etc., WITH modifiers indicating the  presence of low-K minerals: hornblende, chlorite, albite,  epidote)  Hornblendite  Actinolite  Amphibolite  Eclogite  Greenschist  Greenstone  4  Introduction  The IFTNC currently classifies parent materials based on four rock types: Basic-Igneous  (Basaltic), Acid- Igneous (Granitic), Metasedimentary, and Mixed (glacial till). In order to  further clarify health-related issues and their potential association with parent materials, a more  specific classification of parent materials according to content of certain critical elements,  especially potassium (K) would be helpful. Such a classification system should allow us to  categorize the rock types found on geologic maps and publications according to element content  and contribution to soil-available nutrient supply. The purpose of this paper is to present a  classification of rock types based on K content; the discussion of rock contribution to soil-available  K supply will be discussed separately. The following classification system was  developed based on a literature review of basic mineralogical, petrographical, geochemical and  geological information.  Development of a K-based Classification  The three primary classes of rocks are igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. These  categories are interrelated as shown in Figure 1 (Gillen 1982). Within each of these categories,  there are various nomenclature systems available. While standard nomenclature systems exist  for all rock types, these classifications are rather complex and not directly suited to our needs. As  such, nomenclature should be our last resort when classifying rocks for K content. Instead, we  should go directly to a more specific mineralogical or geochemical breakdown for a given rock  at a given site, whenever this information is available.  ‘Mineralogy’ refers to the identification and classification of specific minerals according  to chemical composition, crystal form and physical properties. 'Petrography' refers to the visual  5  description of a given rock, usually from a thin section under a microscope, which breaks the  rock down into volume percent of each of its mineral components. 'Geochemistry' refers to the  process by which the rock is actually weighed, crushed and put through a number of analytic  chemical processes, resulting in an analysis of the individual elements in an oxide form, by  weight percent. Tables 1 and 2 show examples of mineralogical and geochemical descriptions,  respectively (Klein and Hurlbut 1989).  Geochemical descriptions are more indicative of the total K in a given rock than are  petrographical descriptions, and though expensive, they seem to be becoming a more common  practice. For our purposes, geochemical descriptions would be the preferred choice for  classifying a given rock. A review of available information from a variety of sources indicates  that a range of values is associated with any given rock type, as would be expected due to  variability within the nomenclature systems. However, we propose a breakdown of rock types  into high, medium and low- K categories according to K2O content (weight %) as follows:  High- K Rocks: &gt;3.50% K2O  Medium- K Rocks: 1.75-3.49% K2O  Low- K Rocks: &lt;1.75% K2O  This classification should work as long as we have geochemical information for a given rock  type. In lieu of geochemical analyses, petrographic descriptions would be the next choice for  classifying rock types by K content. In order to remain comparable with geochemical  descriptions, it would be desirable to convert petrographical descriptions from volume percent of  various minerals to weight percent of K2O. While this will not give us as precise an estimate of  K2O as would a geochemical analysis, there is a procedure available for making this conversion,  as shown in the appendix. Following is a brief review of minerals and mineralogy, followed by a  6  more detailed discussion of each of the rock categories (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic),  including standard nomenclature and a proposed K-classification system.  Mineralogy  The rock-forming minerals are grouped according to structure and chemical composition  (Battey 1981, Klein and Hurlbut 1977). Potassium is primarily found in three mineralogical  groups. These three groups are the K-feldspar group, the feldspathoid group and the mica group.  The only difference between the K-feldspar group and the feldspathoid group is that the  feldspathoids are silica deficient, and are less common. Of main interest to us are the K-feldspar  and the mica groups. The minerals pertaining to each of these groups are as follows:  Group Mineral Description  K-feldspar Sanidine extrusive, from high temperature lava  Orthoclase intrusive, a medium temperature rock  Microcline deep-seated, slow cooling  Micas Muscovite common, characteristic of granites; chief  constituent of mica schists. Muscovites are also the  source of the clay minerals sericite and illite.  Biotite dark colored mineral; found in granites, diorites  Feldspathoids Leucite rare except in certain lavas  Nepheline in silica-deficient rocks  Generally, if we have any of these minerals, then we have K. For the most part, these are light-colored  minerals which form felsic rocks (older terminology 'acid'). The darker, non-K minerals  form mafic rocks (older terminology 'basic'). The exception to this color rule is biotite, which is  a dark-colored K mineral. There are other K-bearing minerals, therefore if a rock name or  petrographic description contains the name of an unfamiliar mineral, a mineral index showing  7  the chemical formula should be consulted to determine whether or not K is present. For  purposes of addressing weathering, a flow chart showing the 'stability indices' of various sand  and silt-sized mineral particles is shown in Figure 2, along with an equivalent series for clay-sized  particles (from Buol et al. 1989).  Igneous Rocks  Igneous rocks are classified as either volcanic or plutonic rocks. Volcanic rocks are the  result of extruded magma, or magma that made it to the surface of the earth, and are faster  cooling and smaller grained than their plutonic counterparts. The plutonic rocks are deep-seated  or intrusive rocks, which cooled inside the earth's crust, and therefore cooled slower and have  larger grain size. Mineralogically speaking, volcanic and plutonic rocks do not differ greatly  from each other, they simply have different grain sizes. Therefore, a mineralogical classification  of volcanic rocks will have an equivalent classification of plutonic rocks.  While several igneous rock classification systems are available, the one which seems to  be most universally accepted and is commonly used on geologic maps and in the literature  follows the nomenclature provided by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS)  Commission of Petrography. This system is represented in Figures 3a and 3b on triangles which  classify the rocks according to quartz content and feldspar content, in volume  percent (from Klein and Hurlbut, 1977). The feldspar may be of the K/Na variety (alkali) or the  Na/Ca variety (plagioclasic). The base of the triangle shows the alkali (potentially high-K) rocks  on the left, and the plagioclasic (definitely low-K) rocks on the right. The top of the triangle  indicates high quartz percentage (definitely low-K), while the base indicates rocks lower in  quartz (possibly higher-K). Hence, there is a gradual transition from potentially high- to  8  definitely low- K rocks as we go across the triangle from left to right, and as we increase in  quartz going from bottom to top. It should be noted that the placement of lines on this diagram  is arbitrary, and that a great deal of variation occurs within and among these groups.  Again, for our purposes a geochemical description of the specific rock under scrutiny  would be preferred. In lieu of that, a great number of publications are available which list  average geochemical breakdowns for various igneous rock types (Dutro et al 1989, Hyndman  1972, Nockolds & Allen 1954). Using these figures in combination with the IUGS nomenclature  system, a breakdown of igneous rocks into three K categories would be as follows:  Igneous Rock K-Groups  K-Group Plutonic Volcanic  High Nepheline syenite Phonolite  (Felsic, Acid) Alkali granites, syenites Alkali rhyolites, trachytes  Granite Rhyolite  Quartz syenite Quartz trachyte  Syenite Trachyte  Monzonite Latite  Medium Some lower-K granites Rhyodacite  (Intermed.) Quartz monzonite Quartz latite  Granodiorite Dacite  Quartz diorites Latite-andesites  Monzodiorite, diorite Latite-basalt  Low Tonalite Quartz andesite  (Mafic, Basic) Low-K quartz diorites Andesite  Gabbro, Anorthosite Basalt  Peridotite, Pyroxenite  Modifiers may be used with any of these terms, and the modifiers will give more information  based on mineralogy and/or texture. This is particularly important if we have no other  geochemical/mineralogical information to work with, because addition of a modifier may allow  us to better categorize a particular rock.  9  Sedimentary Rocks  Sedimentary rocks are the result of weathering of igneous, metamorphic and other  sedimentary rocks (Blatt 1982, Pettijohn et al. 1987, Hatch and Rastall 1971). They tend to be  classified based on particle size rather than mineralogical components, for several reasons.  Since sedimentary rocks are the result of weathering of other rocks, the mineralogical  components tend to be fairly regionalized according to the source rock type and degree and type  of weathering. Mineralogical components of sedimentary rocks are often quite difficult to  identify in the field, especially the potentially K-bearing clay minerals. A fairly standard  breakdown of sedimentary rocks according to particle size is as follows:  Category Rock Types  detrital rocks mudstones, sandstones, other mixed types  (conglomerates, breccias, volcanic detritus, tuffs,  agglomerates)  carbonate rocks limestones, dolomites  chemical precipitates ironstones, evaporates, cherts, phosphates  For our purposes, sedimentary rocks of detrital origin will be of the most interest, both because  these rocks comprise 80-90% of all sedimentary rocks, and because K minerals will primarily be  found in this group. Volcanic tuffs may contain some K as well; the carbonate and chemical  precipitates will generally not contain K minerals except as impurities. Within the detrital rock  category, mudstones are most prevalent (65%), followed by sandstones (25%), and others (10%).  A review of available geochemical information on average sandstones and mudstones  indicate that sandstones generally fall into the lower end of our medium-K category (Ave. K2O  2.1), while average mudstones fall into the higher end of our medium- K categories (Ave. K2O  3.2-3.3). However, as previously mentioned, the mineralogy of sedimentary rocks can be highly  10  variable based on regional occurrences. For example, certain feldspathic sandstones can have  K2O percentages as high as 4.30-4.80 (Pettijohn et al. 1987) because of K-feldspar content,  while certain quartz-rich mudstones can have K2O percentages as low as 0.69 (Crook 1974).  Therefore, the detailed descriptions given on our geologic maps may be preferable for  classifying sedimentary rock as high, medium or low K. In reading descriptions from geological  maps, it would be a good idea to consult a dictionary of geologic terms, because there seems to  be a great deal of variation in sedimentary terminology among the different classification  schemes.  Generally speaking, sedimentary rocks will probably contain less K than our high-K  group (i.e. the felsic (acid) igneous rocks) due to the mobility and instability of K minerals under  weathering. Source materials are of primary interest to us when interpreting the K status of any  sedimentary rock. For example, a granitoid source rock will more likely contain the K-feldspars,  while a granodiorite or gabbro source rock will more likely result in plagioclase feldspars (Blatt  1982). We do know that K-feldspars, particularly microcline, are generally more abundant than  the plagioclasic feldspars (Pettijohn et al. 1972, Hatch and Rastall 1971). This is largely because  plagioclases tend to break down more quickly than orthoclases. We also know that the K-feldspars  weather to illite and sericite clays (alterations of muscovite); the plagioclase feldspars  to montmorillonite (Blatt 1982). Both illite and montmorillonite weather to kaolinite, a K-poor  clay. Other K-bearing clay minerals include phlogopite and biotite. Current climatic conditions  (cool and temperate) favor the stability of the clay minerals. An interesting note regarding clays  and geologic time: Illite forms about 25% of modern clay minerals, increasing to about 80% in  the Paleozoic era. This is thought to be the result of diagenesis, or the conversion of alternating  montmorillonite/illite clay sheets to pure illite under increasing pressure and temperature. We  11  might take this one step further to infer that our pre-Mesozoic (including Precambrian) clays  might also be higher in illite than our ""newer"" clays.  Mudstones include rocks of silt and clay-sized particles (here, clay is a size fraction and  not a mineral group), and may be categorized in order of increasing clay and decreasing silt  content: siltstone (&gt;2/3 silt), mudstone (1/3-2/3 clay), and claystone (&gt;2/3 clay) (Blatt 1982).  Illite, sericite, phlogopite, and biotite are K-bearing clay minerals which we would look for in  classifying a mudstone. Silt-sized particles may also include K-bearing micas or feldspars. As  far as placing a mudstone in a high-, medium- or low- K category, the modifiers listed in the  field description will often help (for example, 'carbonaceous' would indicate low K). If the rock  is known to exist from the Cambrian or preCambrian eras, we could classify it as medium-K.  Given the general prevalence of K-feldspars which weather to illite, and the geochemical  averages for mudstones which are in the medium category, in the absence of any identifiers, a  mudstone would be classified as a medium-K rock.  Sandstones consist of sand-sized grains, with or without a matrix or cement holding them  together (Jenks 1996, pers. comm.). The grains may consist of rock fragments (lithic grains),  quartz grains, and/or feldspar grains; some geologists include feldspar grains with the lithic  grains. The grains may be loose, or may be held together by either a matrix (detrital material), a  cement (chemical precipitate), or both. The three potential K sources include the detrital  materials in the matrix (specifically clay minerals and feldspar or lithic particles), lithic grains,  and feldspar grains. Lithic grains are often composed of micas, so they have a fair chance of  containing K. Feldspar grains cannot be differentiated into potassic and plagioclasic types  outside of a laboratory (Tucker 1982, Pettijohn et al. 1972, Hatch and Rastall 1971). In the  absence of a geochemical or petrographical description, we can look for several things. As  12  previously mentioned, if we know a source rock, this would help us out. Any information about  the quartz percentage would also help; a high quartz percentage would indicate a low-K rock. A  low quartz percentage would indicate greater clay, feldspar and/or lithic percentages and would  thus be a potentially higher-K rock. Modifiers such as micaceous, arkosic or feldspathic would  be indicators of a lower quartz percentage and therefore a potentially higher-K sandstone. Given  the broad geochemical average for sandstones and the knowledge that some sandstones in the  Inland northwest are of the micaceous variety, we could cautiously place sandstones in the  medium-K category, in lieu of other geochemical or mineralogical information.  Other sedimentary rocks in the detrital category include various mixes of weathered  rocks (larger than sand-sized particles) from a variety of sources. They are classified based on  origin, uniformity, texture, depositional mechanism, and presence or absence of a matrix. These  detrital mixes consist of large clasts with or without a muddy or sandy matrix. The clasts may be  of pebble size or larger, and they are often described as conglomerate if rounded, or breccia if  angular. Other terms used in this category include agglomerates, tuffs and tills. If a volcanic  source is known, then some information may be given as to whether the detrital material is of  rhyolitic (higher K) or andesitic/basaltic (lower K) composition. If we know that a depositional  rock group is primarily of intraformational (local) origin, then we could probably make a K-classification  call based on the surrounding rock type. However, our experience indicates that  within many depositional rock types (such as alluvial or glacial deposits), there can be a great  deal of variability even within a small unit area. Therefore, if we have a geologic map unit  indicating one of these detrital types and no detailed description, we really have no way of  classifying these rocks.  13  Sedimentary Rock K-Groups  K-Group Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Sedimentary Med.

'Regional'  metamorphism refers to large scale metamorphism, while 'contact' or 'local' metamorphism refers  generally to metamorphism on a local scale, usually by contact with magma from a local  intrusion. The 'grade' of metamorphism is also often referred to; the higher the degree of  pressure and temperature change, the higher the 'grade' of metamorphism. High grade  metamorphic rocks have undergone high temperature and pressure changes, and low grade  metamorphic rocks have undergone low temperature and pressure changes. During  metamorphism, certain groups of minerals tend to occur repeatedly, and are known as 'mineral  assemblages.' Metamorphic rocks are classified into groups known as 'facies' according to the  14  development of these mineral assemblages. The key minerals of a facies are known as the 'index  minerals.' Though a rock undergoing metamorphosis may progress through the various facies,  the same elements that we started with will generally still be there following metamorphism.  However, there is a process known as 'metasomatism' by which new replacement products  known as 'skarns' may be produced during metamorphosis. Metasomatism occurs due to  chemical reactions involving interstitial pore liquids or gases contained in the rock or introduced  from outside the rock body. Metasomatism is often associated with faults and mineral ridge  areas, and the replacement products may or may not contain K.  Textural terms used in conjunction with metamorphic rocks include hornfels, slate,  phyllite, schist, and gneiss, which represent metamorphosed rocks of increasing grain size and  layering from fine through coarse. The terms 'metacryst' and 'porphyroblast' refer to large  crystals formed in metamorphic rocks by recrystallization. The term 'fabric' refers to the  alignment of the grains in a rock. 'Schist' and 'gneiss' are fabric terms referring to how closely  spaced the 'bands' or layers in a rock are, which in turn relate to the amount of mica or other  platy minerals present. While not a rule, it is generally found that the schists (platy, narrower  bands) are mica-rich rocks and contain &lt;20% feldspars, while gneisses (wider bands) contain  &gt;20% feldspar. If a metamorphic rock is known to have a sedimentary protolith, then the prefix  'para-' is used. If an igneous rock was the source, then 'ortho-' is used. So a gneiss of  sedimentary origin is a paragneiss, and one of igneous origin would be an orthogneiss.  Unfortunately, none of these textural terms implies the presence of any characteristic  minerals. If a rock is described simply as a 'gneiss' or a 'schist,' we have no way of classifying  that for K content; in other words some descriptor of mineral constituents is needed. If low-grade  metamorphism occurred and the protolith is still identifiable, then we may classify a  15  metamorphic rock according to its sedimentary, felsic igneous or mafic igneous parent rock.  Unfortunately, more often than not the protolith is not identifiable, particularly if a rock has been  highly metamorphosed. Therefore, we will more often have to depend on the geologic map  description. Standard metamorphic nomenclature includes to a list of mineral constituents (the  mineral assemblage) placed in front of the rock name. In order to be included in this mineral  assemblage, a mineral must comprise more than 5% by volume of the rock. The minerals are  then listed in front of the rock name, in order of decreasing content. For example, a K-bearing  schist might be a 'biotite-garnet-staurilite schist (biotite is the primary constituent)', while a  lower-K schist might be a 'quartz-mica-garnet schist (quartz is the primary constituent, followed  by mica).' Due to the wide variety of potential mineral assemblages, only a few more common  metamorphic rocks will be listed in the summary of K-classification by rock type.  16  Summary of K-groupings:  HIGH-K ROCKS: K2O &gt; 3.50 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Acid Igneous Rocks  Plutonic Volcanic  Nepheline syenite Phonolite  Alkali granites, syenites Alkali rhyolites, trachytes  Granite Rhyolite  Quartz syenite Quartz trachyte  Syenite Trachyte  Monzonite Latite  MEDIUM-K ROCKS: K2O 1.76-3.50 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Intermediate Igneous Rocks  Plutonic Volcanic  Some lower-K granites Rhyodacite  Quartz monzonite Quartz latite  Granodiorite Dacite  Quartz diorites Latite-andesites  Monzodiorite, diorite Latite-basalt  Medium-K Sedimentary Rocks  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Mudstones Graywackes; K-clays (illite, sericite, phlogopite, biotite)  predominant, or era Paleozoic and earlier, OR no other information  available  Clayey Sandstones Arkose, graywackes; modifiers micaceous, arkosic, feldspathic,  lithic  Volcanic Rhyolitic detritus & tuffs  Medium-K Metamorphic Rocks (partial list)  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Meta-mudstones Argillite, slate, siltite  Metamorphics Schists, phyllites, gneisses, etc., WITH modifiers indicating the  presence of high-K minerals: biotite, muscovite, phlogopite, K-feldspars)  17  LOW-K ROCKS: K20 &lt;= 1.75 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Basic Igneous Rocks  Plutonic Volcanic  Tonalite Quartz andesite  Low-K quartz diorites Andesite  Gabbro, Anorthosite Basalt  Peridotite, Pyroxenite  Low-K Sedimentary Rocks  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Mudstones Graywackes, subgraywackes; K-clays not predominant, modifiers  carbonaceous, siliceous  Sandstones Arenite, quartzarenite; modifier quartz; anything with the prefix  sub- (this indicates a high quartz percentage); OR no other  information available  Undefined detritus Conglomerates, breccias, agglomerates, tuffs, tills  Volcanic Andesitic detritus & tuffs  Carbonate rocks Limestone, dolomite  Chemical precipitates Ironstones, evaporates, chert  Low-K Metamorphic Rocks (partial list)  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Meta-sandstones Quartzites  Metamorphics Schists, phyllites, gneisses, etc., WITH modifiers indicating the  presence of low-K minerals: hornblende, chlorite, albite, epidote)  Hornblendite  Actinolite  Amphibolite  Eclogite  Greenschist  Greenstone  18  LITERATURE CITED  Battey M.H. 1981.

Two years after fertilization, overall gross basal area response was 31.1% on  those plots receiving the 200 lb. nitrogen (N) acre and 33.8% on those plots receiving 200  lb. nitrogen plus 200 lb. potassium (K) acre.

Western larch and mixed species sites expressed good absolute response. Gross Basal area  response was similar to foliar nutrient and needle weight response. The addition of potassium to the  fertilizer mix did not significantly affect two year basal area growth or response.  Methods  Study Area  The study area is located in north central Washington within the Okanogan National Forest. The  eight study sites were established on the Chelan, Twisp and Winthrop Ranger Districts. Sites were  evenly distributed in two main areas located on either the east or west side of the Okanogan River  drainage. Appendix A shows the installation locations in north central Washington.  Design and Treatments  The eight study sites (48 plots) were established in the fall of 1993 and consist of six square 0.1  acre plots. The plots were grouped into two blocks of three plots based on tree and site similarities. The  treatments include control (C), nitrogen (N) and nitrogen plus potassium (NK). Nitrogen was applied in  2  the urea form and potassium in the murate of potash form at the rate of 200 lbs/acre for both nutrients by  treatment. Installations were located by design in young (mean DBH 3-11 inches) stands with nearly  homogeneous species compositions (basal area/ac. composition &gt; 65% for the dominant species).  Ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine and western larch are the dominate species composition types. Site  characteristics for the eight conifer study sites are given in Table 1.  Table 1.

At time of establishment all live trees taller  than 4.5 feet in height were tallied, tagged, heights and diameters measured and defect determination  recorded. Vegetation, soils and parent material information is also collected at time of establishment.  Every two years diameters are remeasured on all the trees and any incidence of damage or mortality  along with probable cause will be noted. Heights will be remeasured every four years after treatment on  all trees, but not after two years. Detailed mensurational and plot characteristics at time of  establishment and two years after treatment are given in Appendix B.  One year after treatment, dormant (fall) season foliage samples were obtained for foliar nutrient  determination (see Garrison and Moore, 1995). Two dominant or codominant trees from the two most  dominant species on each plot were selected for collection. Foliage was collected from the third whorl  3  from the top of each tree by climbing. Detailed information on foliar nutrient levels one year after  treatment are given in Appendix C.  Data Analysis  Growth is be defined as gross basal area (sq.ft./ac.) for a two year period. Response is defined as  the difference between the treated plots versus the control plots. Percent relative basal area response for  species comparisons was calculated using the following formula:  The experimental design model used for absolute  and relative two year gross basal area growth took this general form:  Growth = F(Installation, Block, Treatment)  Absolute gross two year basal area growth and relative (control treatment growth) percent basal area  response by species type took this general form:  Growth (response) = F(Species, Installation, Block, Treatment)  Species basal area response comparisons were based on species composition by installation. Basal area  growth and response by species was determined by pooling installations with composition greater than  65% for a given species.  General linear contrasts and differences between means by treatment for basal area growth were  determined by using the least-squares routine of the general linear models procedure (PROC GLM) of  the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute Inc. 1985).

Analysis of variance for absolute gross  basal area growth and response by species is given in Table 4. The contrasts between means are  considered average growth responses to the treatments. Tree mortality was low and did not affect the  response results, therefore, only gross basal area response will be presented for this report.  Results and Discussion  Nitrogen basal area response differed significantly between the fertilizer treatments and the  control treatment. Overall gross basal area response on N alone treated plots was 31.1% higher than  control plots. When K was added to the N fertilizer mix overall response was 33.8% higher over that of  the control plots. Basal area response was not significantly different between plots receiving N alone  and plots receiving the NK treatment (Table 2).  Table 2.

Two year absolute basal area growth response ranged from 0.4 to 4.0  sq. ft./ac. on the plots receiving N alone and 0.6 to 4.1 sq. ft./ac. on the plots receiving the NK treatment  (Table 3). Addition of K to the fertilizer mix did not significantly (p &lt; 0.10) increase growth response  over that of the N alone treatment for any installation. Although potassium has an indirect effect on  plant growth, existing literature and previous IFTNC results show that K primarily effects tree mortality  rather than tree growth. Therefore, growth effects from K fertilization would not likely be seen within  5  the first couple of years after treatment. The nitrogen plus potassium treatment on Installation 328 had  the highest basal area response on the NK treatment with a 87% increase over that of the control plots.  Installation 330 did not show a significant absolute growth response, however, relative basal area  response to the N alone treatment was higher (65%) than for any other installation (Table 3). High  percent response but low growth increase for installation 330 is an example of good fertilization  response on a slow growing site.  Table 3.

Two year absolute  gross basal area growth for all treatments was highest for the mixed conifer installation (#333) and sites  with species composition predominately western larch (basal area &gt; 65%) (Table 4). Two year gross  basal area response for each species type follow this order: LP &gt; MIX &gt; WL &gt; PP. Large growth rates  occur on the mixed conifer installation (#329) which is a young stand comprised of small trees (Table  1). The large basal area growth differences between installations may explain response differences and  therefore species comparisons. Further analysis will be required after the fourth growing season when  height growth will be measured.  All four species types show a positive response to the fertilization treatments. Response results  are illustrated graphically on an individual installation basis in Figure 1 and on a species composition  basis in Figure 2. Figure 1a shows that both ponderosa pine installations (327 and 330) produced a low  absolute growth response (wood production) but #330 had a percent response (70%) relative to the  controls. Lodgepole pine (Figure 1b) nitrogen fertilization response over the controls was very high on  installations 328 and 332 and high on installation 331. Western larch (Figure 1c) and mixed conifer  installations (Figure 1d) produced low growth response but installation #334 showed high percent  response.  Analysis by combined species type (Table 4 and Figure 2a) shows that absolute basal area  response to nitrogen fertilization was highest for those sites with species composition dominated by  lodgepole pine. Lodgepole pine fertilization response was significantly higher on fertilized plots (N  alone (p &lt; 0.0001) 2.6 sq. ft/ac. (50%) and NK 3.2 sq. ft/ac. (62%) (Table 4). Nitrogen alone and NK  treatment plots were significantly (p &lt; 0.10) higher than the control for both the western larch and mixed  species composition types. Ponderosa pine had the lowest growth response for both fertilizer treatments  8  but did show good percent response by treatment. Relative response by species type is shown in Figure  2b. Response relative to control plot relative growth for both fertilizer treatments by species type  followed this order: LP &gt; PP &gt; WL &gt; MIX. Relative percent response is consistant with absolute  percent response to the fertilizer treatments (Table 4 and Figure 2a).  Figure 1.

Lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine two year basal area results for these installations are  consistent with foliar nutrient and needle weight responses reported by Garrison and Moore (1995).  Results from the current report on basal area response and from Garrison and Moore (1995) on foliar  nutrition and needle weights show that lodgepole pine had the highest basal area response, the most  efficient nutrient uptake and the only significant increase in needle weight after treatment, when  compared to the other species in the study. Ponderosa pine followed lodgepole pine in foliar and needle  weight response. In addition, in a similar IFTNC mixed conifer study located on the Umatilla National  Forest, lodgepole pine expressed high two year relative basal area response with ponderosa pine  showing low or negative response.  11  Literature Cited  Garrison, M.T. and J.A.

Mensurational data  were collected from 55 Douglas-fir and 69 grand fir individual trees from 14 one-half  acre plots. Foliage samples from the third whorl ofeach tree were taken, and tree  positions were mapped using a Global Positional System (GPS). A stochastic modeling  method, the sequential conditional Gaussian simulation, was used to study tree volume  and foliar nutrient flow dynamics. Spatial variations were analyzed between individual  tree measurements and nitrogen, potassium and boron concentrations under different  fertilization treatments. The study showed that there are species differences in the  distribution of foliage nutrient concentrations and tree biomass. Potassium and boron  concentrations were lower in plots treated with high nitrogen rates. Boron concentration  values were higher on the untreated plot.  INTRODUCTION  Nutrient deficiency in Inland Northwest forests has been demonstrated in past  studies (Zasoski, 1979; Lavender and Walker, 1979). Nitrogen is commonly the limiting  nutrient for tree growth. According to results ofthe Intennountain Forest Tree Nutrition  Cooperative (IFmC), foliar nitrogen concentrations in Douglas-fir trees were below the  adequate level of 1.6% in the Inland Northwest region (Mika et al, 1994). Without  adequate nitrogen, tree growth is significantly reduced.  IFmc has been working in the Inland Northwest since 1980. Its primary focus  has been fertilization of forest tree species using nitrogen and potassium fertilizers.  Study sites are located throughout the region. Data on growth response has been  collected extensively for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziessi var. glauca). Other tree  species such as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), grand fir (Abies grandis), western  larch (Larix occidenta/is), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) also are being studied  (Moore et ai, 1991). According to IFTNC tree growth response data, nitrogen  fertilization has produced growth increases of trees across all regions in the area (Mika et  al, 1992).  One way to examine tree growth response is through foliage nutrient analysis.  Substantial numbers of foliage tree samples have been collected in most ofthe IFmC  trial plots under different fertilizer treatment regimes. Nutrient spatial distributions for  different tree species is being investigated as a means to assist in tree nutrition  management decisions. This paper presents the results ofa study to evaluate the spatial  variation in foliar nutrient concentrations of Douglas-fir and grand fir, as well as tree  biomass distribution. We also evaluated nutrient distribution maps by overlaying data  points not analyzed in the training data set. The research site is one ofthe IFmC  installations located near Bovill, Idaho. Preliminary spatial analysis results will help  relate tree biomass and nutrient distributions for this particular site that can be expanded  in the future for developing operational foliage sampling designs.  METHODS AND MATERIALS  Study area geology and vegetation  The study site is located in Latah County, I kilometer east ofBovill, Idaho. The  area is 600 by 600 meters square, or 3.6 hectares (89 acres), that is managged by Idaho  Department of Lands. Topography is gently sloping with elevations ranging from 849 to  1052 meters (2785 to 3451 feet). Geology is characterized by a mixture of parent  materials: colluvium, stream and lake deposits overlaying granite bedrock (Johnson and  Raines, 1995). Figure I shows the study area and geology.

Map ofthe study area and geology near Bovill, Idaho  The stand is comprised mainly ofDouglas-frr and grand fir. Western larch and  white pine are minor species in the study area. The research site was established in 1994  as a nitrogen and potassium multi-rate study trial composed of 14 one-half acre plots. A  description ofthe different plot treatments is provided in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the  location ofthe plots within the study area.  Table 1.

Sample plot locations within the study area (installation 335)  Data collection  Tree measurement. Individual tree measurements were taken in 1994 for all trees in the  plots. The tree data included: diameter at breast height, basal area, height, crown closure,  age; and physical site characteristics: slope, aspect, elevation, and habitat type. The DF  trees ranged from 56 to 89 years old, diameter between 10.75 and 24.94 inches, and  height between 72.6 and 108.6 feet. For GF trees ages ranged from 52 to 100 years old,  diameter between 10.46 and 21.70 inches, and height between 73.7 and 117.4 feet.  Foliage. In 1995, samples of foliage were collected for Douglas-fir and grand fir to  assess foliar nutrient concentrations. The samples were taken from the third internode  (whorl) down from the top ofthe tree from five selected dominant or co-dominant trees  for each ofthe two species in each ofthe 14 plots of the study area (lFTNC, 1995). A  total of 55 DF and 69 GF sample trees were sampled at this time (the requirement of five  DF per plot was not always met at some locations). Foliage samples were dried and sent  to Scotts laboratory for tissue analysis. The foliage analysis included aluminum, boron,  calcium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nitrogen,  sodium, phosphorus, and zinc concentrations (Scotts, 1996).  Tree location. To map the location ofeach tree on the ground, a Global Positional  System was utilized (Trimble, 1992). The receiver was placed at the base ofeach  sampled tree. Coordinates were expressed as longitude and latitude. These then were  converted to Albers metric projection coordinates.  Data analysis  Statistics. The data set for each species was analyzed independently. Variability within  the stand was analyzed. The first step was to conduct a multivariate statistical analysis in  order to identify the more important nutrient variables for subsequent modeling.  Principal component analysis and factor analysis are statistical procedures dealing with  situations where a number ofvariables have a joint multivariate distribution and lead to a  reduction in the number ofvariables selected for further study (Johnson and Wichern,  1992; Laar, 1987). The multivariate statistical analysis was achieved using SAS (1993).  Each data set of 13 nutrients was analyzed. For the DF data set, the first principal  component, nitrogen, produced one ofthe largest positive values (scores) among the other  nutrients, 0.327; and potassium produced the largest negative score -0.404. Thus, the  large difference in these scores indicates that nitrogen and potassium are important  nutrients in this multivariate data set. In this manner each component was analyzed. For  the DF data set, seven important nutrients were identified: nitrogen, potassium,  molybdenum, sodium, zinc, iron, and boron. For the OF data set, seven nutrients also  were identified: nitrogen, potassium, iron, sodium, boron, zinc, and phosphorus. The  results are shown in Tables 2 and 3 below.  Table 2.

The common tool used to describe spatial dependence is the variogram function,  which relates the difference in paired data values to the spatial distance that separates the  two sampling locations (see Appendix). Variograms are characterized by: 1) sill, the  variogram value to which the function rises then levels off at a plateau (equivalent to the  sample variance); 2) range, the separation distance at which the sill is reached; 3) nugget,  the variogram value at zero separation distance (Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989).  Once variograms were calculated and modeled, a spatial simulation procedure,  sequential Gaussian conditional simulation (sgCS), was used to map the nutrients by  estimating values at unsampled locations (Deutsch and Journel, 1992). Such a  ""conditional"" simulation will honor (reproduce) the known data values ifthey happen to  coincide with simulation grid nodes. To describe the uncertainty in the potential nutrient  levels at unsampled locations, 100 simulation passes (realizations) were generated. Each  realization is intended to produce one possible map ofnutrients. Further, to evaluate  simulation validity, four DF and six GF samples were reserved for testing and validation.

Two computer packages, one by Englund and Sparks (1991) GEO-EAS, and one  by Deutsh and Joumel (1992) GSLIB, were used to estimate variograms, then conduct the  conditional simulations, respectively. The simulation area was 600 by 600 meters  producing a grid map of40 by 40 nodes at a regular spacing of 15 meters. Once the  realization values were obtained, they were mapped using the grid module in Arclnfo  (ESRI, 1995), converted to vector mode, then displayed as the simulated realization maps  in ARCVIEW 2.1 (ESRI, 1993). Figure 4 presents sample variograms for the variables  under study.

Nitrogen mean values are high toward the west, northeast,  southeast, and north side ofthe research site (where high nitrogen fertilization rates  occurred), while lowest values are toward the northwest, northeast, southwest (where  control and low nitrogen fertilization rates occur), and at the center, even though plot 9  has a high nitrogen rate, (see Figure 2 and Table 1). High standard deviation values are  scattered throughout the area, while pronounced low values trend from northeast to  southwest. Highest potassium mean values are toward the center and in minor areas of  the northeast and southwest. Low values are in those areas where high nitrogen mean  values are found, while the highest standard deviation values occur throughout the area.  Boron shows the highest mean values toward the west, south, and northeast sides; and its  standard deviation values tend to be higher in the south portion ofthe study area.  Grand fir data. High nitrogen mean values are found toward the west, southeast,  and northeast portions ofthe study area and lowest values from the center toward the  southwest zone. This area of low means is more spatially continous for the GF values  compared to the DF values. Highest standard deviations are toward the southeast and  toward the east and north; low values occur from the center to the southwest portion of  the study area. Potassium shows high values toward the southwest zone and in the center  ofthe area. Again, its standard deviations are scattered throughout. Boron shows its  highest values toward the southwest comer and to a lesser extent in the northeast comer.  -.N UIU'  0.736 .1.400  Ell UOI .1.600  _ l.601 ·2.370  K Melina  0.377· 0.800  _ 0.801 • 1.000  _ 1.001 • 1.590  8 Mellns  10.00 • 20.00  _ 20.01 ·30.00  _ 30.01 ·40.30  N SlIndo'"" O..iolionl  0.265·0.365  _ 0.365 ·O.3n  _ 0.3n ·1.352  K SIllnd aid DeylaliGn a  0.121 ·0.182  _ 0.182·0223  _ 0.223·0.884  BS II ndo'd Ol.lahonl  6.148·7.528  _ 7.521 ·8082  _ 8.082 ·13475  Figure 5.

In general, the DF spatial maps show that the lowest potassium mean values are  found in areas having the highest nitrogen mean values, however the association was not  as strong for boron. By the same token, GF data behave similarly but the distribution is  wider than those ofthe DF data set. Also, the highest boron mean values are found near  the control plot area and the lowest concentrations are found at the high nitrogen  treatments.  Figure 7 represents exceedance probability values for selected cutoffs ofnitrogen,  potassium, and boron considerated to be adequate foliar nutrient levels (Webster and  Dobkowski, 1983; Ingestad, 1979; Powers, 1983). For nitrogen DF data the highest  probability that the stand will be above 1.6% is toward the east, southwest and northeast.  The lowest probability is in the center and southeast zone. This same pattern holds for  nitrogen GF data. Exceedance probability values for potassium are more pronounced for  the GF data set than that ofthe DF data. The potassium cutoff value of 0.5 % for GF is  low compared to most ofthe simulated values, which reflect the high original data values  (the minimum measured K value was 0.66%). Thus, the map ofGF K (P &gt; 0.5 %) shows  most ofthe area to have a very high probability of exceeding a K concentration of0.5%.  Boron exceedance probability values are lowest in the southwest quadrant for DF, but  highest for GF.  Figure 8 shows the spatial distribution oftree volumes for the study area.  Volumes are highest toward the southwest, center, and some parts toward the north for  the DF data. For the GF, data volume is evenly distributed across the whole area with  some volume concentration toward the center and southwest zones. Comparing tree  biomass and nutrient concentrations, it seems that the west side and particularly the  southwest side have adequate levels ofnitrogen and potassium and abundant amounts of  boron for both species. Also, by field observations of plots 2, 3, and 4, where most ofthe  highest nutrient values occur, the stand is doing well in terms oftree health and biomass  accumulation.  To validate the simulation models, we left out test samples to determine how well  the simulated nutrient maps agree with actual observations. Figure 9 portrays results for  the four DF and six GF trees used as controls for testing the simulated model against the  actual foliar nutrient concentrations. The point data set for these testing trees was overlaid  on the simulated nitrogen, potassium, and boron mean values. There were some  differences, but in general the simulation models performed quite well. The GF  potassium true and simulated means graph shows the closest comparison ofall the data  sets. For example, for tree 24 the true and simulated mean values are the same. Also, the  same is true for tree 20 for the GF boron comparisons. The largest differences were  shown by the DF potassium true and simulated means comparison, but even here the  simulated means tend to be well within one standard deviation ofthe true value (compare  Figure 9 to Figure 5).  ---------------.-------------  OF nitrogen true and simulated means GF nitrogen true and simulated  means  IIm.Ndata value Mean value  ~ al {:; ~ ~ ~  Tree number  -;  ij i.

CONCLUSIONS  A spatial analysis of Douglas-fir and grand fir foliar concentrations in the study  area shows similar spatial distribution patterns, but with generally wider distributions for  the OF data than for those ofthe DF data. When developing a foliage experimental  design, the spatial range ofinfluence for each nutrient under study should by considered,  as well as the nugget effect. For example, GF nitrogen has a longer range of influence  and lower nugget effect (more spatial dependency at shorter distances) than DF nitrogen  for this particular study area (See Figure 4 and Table 6). Thus, the long-term sampling  plan for GF nitrogen can use more widely spaced samples (Le., less sampling density)  than that used for DF nitrogen. Typically, for a range of influence r, the minimum  sample spacing can be set to about O.3r to O.5r and still provide adequate sampling for  reliable spatial modeling. Sampling plans with minimum spacings wider than this  distance will not provide sufficient spatial continuity information.  This assumes that an initial phase ofsampling already has provided adequate data  to compute and model variograms. Also, this study is based on one type ofgeological  parent material, which certainly can be different at other sites across the landscape.  Research should be expanded to other parent materials to understand the spatial  dependency in soils derived from other types ofrocks.  Spatial simulations provide a means to probabilistically describe spatial patterns  and distributions offoliar nutrients. This methodology can be useful in designing  nutrient treatment programs and sampling layouts, and in assisting with related timber  management decisions.  REFERENCES  Deutsch, C.V. and A.G.

In  order to further clarify health-related issues and their potential association with parent  materials, a more specific classification of parent materials according to content of certain  critical elements, especially potassium (K) would be helpful. Such a classification system  should allow us to categorize the rock types found on geologic maps and publications  according to element content and contribution to soil-available nutrient supply. The purpose  of this paper is to present a classification of rock types based on K content; the discussion of  rock contribution to soil-available K supply will be discussed separately. The following  classification system was developed based on a literature review of basic mineralogical,  petrographical, geochemical and geological infonnation.  Development of a K-based Classification  The three primary classes of rocks are igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. These  categories are interrelated as shown in Figure 1 (Gillen 1982). Within each of these  categories, there are various nomenclature systems available. While standard nomenclature  systems exist for both igneous and sedimentary rocks, these classifications tend to be quite  arbitrary, and it is not uncommon for different geologists to classify the same rock by  different names. As such, nomenclature should be our last resort when classifying rocks for  K content. Instead, we should go directly to a more specific mineralogical or geochemical  breakdown for a given rock at a given site, whenever this information is available.  melting  from mantle  :..-- recrystal/isation  crushing  recombination  (metamorphism)  • products  Qp,ocesses  2  3  'Petrography' or 'mineralogy' refers to the visual description of a given rock, usually from a  thin section under a microscope, which breaks the rock down into volume percent of each of  its mineral components. 'Geochemistry' refers to the process by which the rock is actually  weighed, crushed and put through a number of analytic chemical processes, resulting in an  analysis of the individual elements in an oxide form, by weight percent. Tables 1 and 2  show examples of mineralogical and geochemical descriptions, respectively (Hurlbut & Klein  1989).  Geochemical descriptions are more indicative of the total K in a given rock than are  petrographical descriptions, and though expensive, they seem to be becoming a more  common practice. For our purposes, geochemical descriptions would be the preferred choice  for classifying a given rock. A review of available information from a variety of sources  indicates that a range of values is associated with any given rock name, as would be expected  due to variability within the nomenclature systems. However, we propose a breakdown of  rock types into high, medium and low- K categories according to K20 content (% by weight)  as follows: High- K Rocks: &gt;3.50% K20  Medium- K Rocks: 1.75-3.49% K20  Low- K Rocks: &lt; 1.75%K20  This classification should work as long as we have geochemical information for a given rock  type. In lieu of geochemical analyses, petrographic descriptions would be the next choice for  classifying rock types by K content. In order to remain comparable with geochemical  descriptions, it would be desirable to convert petrographical descriptions from volume  percent of various minerals to weight percent of K20.

Following is a brief review of minerals  and mineralogy, followed by a more detailed discussion of each of the rock categories  (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic), including standard nomenclature and a proposed K-classification  system.  Mineralogy  The rock-forming minerals are grouped according to structure and chemical  composition (Battey 1981, Hurlbut & Klein 1977). Potassium is primarily found in three  mineralogical groups. These three groups are the K-feldspar group, the feldspathoid group  and the mica group. The only difference between the K-feldspar group and the feldspathoid  group is that the feldspathoids are silica (quartz) deficient, and do not seem to be too  common. Of main interest to us are the K-feldspar and the mica groups. The minerals  pertaining to each of these groups are as follows:  Group  K-feldspar  Micas  Feldspathoids  Mineral  Sanidine  Orthoclase  Microcline  Muscovite  Biotite  Leucite  Nepheline  Description  extrusive, from high temperature lava  intrusive, a medium temperature rock  deep-seated, slow cooling  common, characteristic of granites; chief  constituent of mica schists. Muscovites are also  the source of the clay minerals sericite and illite.  dark colored mineral; found in granites, diorites  rare except in certain lavas  in silica-deficient rocks  Generally, if we have any of these minerals, then we have K. For the most part, these are  light-colored minerals, or felsic minerals (older terminology 'acid'). The darker, non-K  6  minerals are termed mafic minerals (older terminology 'basic'). The exception to this color  role is biotite, which is a dark-eolored K mineral. There are other K-bearing minerals,  therefore if a rock name or petrographic description contains the name of an unfamiliar  mineral, a mineral index showing the chemical formula should be consulted to determine  whether or not K is present. For purposes of addressing weathering, a flow chart showing  the 'stability indices' of various sand and silt-sized mineral particles is shown in Figure 2,  along with an equivalent series for clay-sized particles (from Buol et al 1989).  Igneous Rocks  Igneous rocks are classified as either volcanic or plutonic rocks. Volcanic rocks are  the result of extruded lava, or lava that made it to the surface of the earth, and are faster  cooling and smaller grained than their plutonic counterparts. The plutonic rocks are deep­seated  or intrusive rocks, which cooled inside the earth's crust, and therefore cooled slower  and have larger grain size. Mineralogically speaking, volcanic and plutonic rocks do not  differ greatly from each other, they simply have different grain sizes. Therefore, a  mineralogical classification of volcanic rocks will have an equivalent classification of plutonic  rocks.  While several igneous rock classification systems are available, the one which seems  to be most universally accepted and is commonly used on geologic maps and in the literature  follows the nomenclature provided by the International Union of Geological Sciences (lUGS)  Commission of Petrography.

The feldspar may be of the KINa variety (alkali) or  the Na/Ca variety (plagioclasic). The base of the triangle shows the alkali (potentially high-  K) rocks on the left, and the plagioclasic (defmitely low-K) rocks on the right. The top of  the triangle indicates high quartz percentage (defmitely low-K), while the base indicates rocks  lower in quartz (possibly higher-K). Hence, there is a gradual transition from potentially  high- to defInitely low- K rocks as we go across the triangle from left to right, and as we  increase in quartz going from bottom to top. It should be noted that the placement of lines  on this diagram is arbitrary, and that a great deal of variation occurs within and among these  groups.  Again, for our purposes a geochemical description of the specifIc rock under scrutiny  would be preferred. In lieu of that, a great number of publications are available which list  average geochemical breakdowns for various igneous rock types (Dutro et al 1989, Hyndman  1972, Nockolds & Allen 1954). Using these fIgures in combination with the lUGS  nomenclature system, a breakdown of igneous rocks into three K categories would be as  follows:  Igneous Rock K-Groups  K-Group Plutonic  High Nepheline syenite  (Felsic, Acid) Alkali granites, syenites  Granite  Quartz syenite  Syenite  Monzonite  Volcanic  Phonolite  Alkali rhyolites, trachytes  Rhyolite  Quartz trachyte  Trachyte  Latite  Medium  (Intermed.)

This is particularly important if we have no other  geochemicaUmineralogical information to work with, because addition of a modifier may  allow us to better categorize a particular rock.  Sedimentary Rocks  Sedimentary rocks are the result of weathering of igneous, metamorphic and other  sedimentary rocks (Blatt 1982, Pettijohn et al 1987, Hatch & Rastall1971). They tend to be  classified based on particle size and composition rather than mineralogical components, for  several reasons. Since sedimentary rocks are the result of weathering of other rocks, the  mineralogical components tend to be fairly regionalized according to the source rock type  and degree and type of weathering. Mineralogical components of sedimentary rocks are  often quite difficult to identify in the field, especially the potentially K-bearing clay minerals~  A fairly standard breakdown of sedimentary rocks according to particle size is as foHows:  CategOlY  detrital rocks  carbonate rocks  chemical precipitates  Rock Types  mudstones, sandstones, other mixed types  (conglomerates, breccias, volcanic detritus, tuffs,  agglomerates)  limestones, dolomites  ironstones, evaporates, cherts, phosphates  For our purposes, sedimentary rocks of detrital origin will be of the most interest, both  11  because these rocks comprise 80-90% of all sedimentary rocks, and because K minerals will  primarily be found in this group. Volcanic tuffs may contain some K as well; the carbonate  and chemical precipitates will generally not contain K minerals except as impurities. Within  the detrital rock category, mudstones are most prevalent (65%), followed by sandstones  (25%), and others (10%).  A review of available geochemical information on average sandstones and mudstones  indicate that sandstones generally fall into the lower end of our medium-K category (Ave.  K20 2.1), while average mudstones fall into the higher end of our medium- K categories  (Ave. K20 3.2-3.3). However, as previously mentioned, the mineralogy of sedimentary  rocks can be highly variable based on regional occurrences. For example, certain feldspathic  sandstones can have K20 percentages as high as 4.30-4.80 (pettijohn et al 1987), while  certain quartz-rich mudstones can have K20 percentages as low as 0.69 (Crook 1974).  Therefore, the detailed descriptions given on our geologic maps may be preferable for  classifying sedimentary rock as high, medium or low K. In reading descriptions from  geological maps, it would be a good idea to consult a dictionary of geologic terms, because  there seems to be a great deal of variation in sedimentary terminology among the different  authorities.  Generally speaking, sedimentary rocks will probably contain less K than our high-K  group (i.e. the felsic (acid) igneous rocks) due to the mobility and instability of K minerals  under weathering. Source materials are of primary interest to us when interpreting the K  status of any sedimentary rock. For example, a granitoid source rock will more likely  contain the K-feldspars, while a granodiorite or gabbro source rock will more likely result in  12  plagioclase feldspars (Blatt 1982). We do know that K-feldspars, particularly microcline, are  generally more abundant than the plagioclasic feldspars (pettijohn et al1972, Hatch &  Rastall 1971). This is largely because plagioclases tend to break down more quickly than  orthoclases. We also know that the K-feldspars weather to illite and sericite clays  (alterations of muscovite); the plagioclase feldspars to montmorillonite (Blatt 1982). Both  illite and montmorillonite weather to kaolinite, a K-poor clay. Other K-bearing clay minerals  include phlogopite and biotite. Current climatic conditions (cool and temperate) favor the  stability of the clay minerals. An interesting note regarding clays and geologic time: Illite  forms about 25% of modem clay minerals, increasing to about 80% in the Paleozoic era.  This is thought to be the result of diagenesis, or the conversion of alternating  montmorillonite/illite clay sheets to pure illite under increasing pressure and temperature.  We might take this one step further to infer that our pre-Mesozoic (including Precambrian)  clays might also be higher in illite than our ""newer"" clays.  Mudstones include rocks of silt and clay composition, and may be categorized in  order of increasing clay and decreasing silt content: siltstone (&gt;2/3 silO, mudstone (113-2/3  clay), and claystone (&gt; 2/3 clay) (Blatt 1982). Illite, sericite, phlogopite, and biotite are K­bearing  clay minerals which we would look for in classifying a mudstone. Silt-sized particles  may also include K-bearing micas or feldspars. As far as placing a mudstone in a high-,  medium- or low- K category, the modifiers listed in the field description will often help (for  example, 'carbonaceous' would indicate low K). If the rock is known to exist from the  Cambrian or preCambrian eras, we could classify it as medium-K. Given the general  prevalence of K-feldspars which weather to illite, and the geochemical averages for  13  mudstones which are in the medium category, in the absence of any identifiers, a mudstone  would be classified as a medium-K rock.  Sandstones consist of grains, with or without a matrix or cement holding them  together (Jenks 1996, pers. comm.). The grains may consist of rock fragments (lithic  grains), quartz grains, and/or feldspar grains; some geologists include feldspar grains with  the lithic grains. The grains may be loose, or may be held together by either a matrix  (detrital material), a cement (chemical precipitate), or both. The three potential K sources  include the detrital materials in the matrix (specifically clay minerals and feldspar or lithic  particles), lithic grains, and feldspar grains. Lithic grains are often composed of micas, so  they have a fair chance of containing K. Feldspar grains cannot be differentiated into  potassic and plagioclasic types outside of a laboratory (Tucker 1982, Pettijohn 1972, Hatch  & Rastall 1971). In the absence of a geochemical or petrographical description, we can look  for several things. As previously mentioned, if we know a source rock, this would help us  out. Any information about the quartz percentage would also help; a high quartz percentage  would indicate a low-K rock. A low quartz percentage would indicate greater clay, feldspar  and/or lithic percentages and would thus be a potentially higher-K rock. Modifiers such as  micaceous, arkosic or feldspathic would be indicators of a lower quartz percentage and  therefore a potentially higher-K sandstone. Given the broad geochemical average for  sandstones and the knowledge that some sandstones in the Inland northwest are of the  micaceous variety, we could cautiously place sandstones in the medium-K category, in lieu of  other geochemical or mineralogical information.  Other sedimentary rocks in the detrital category include various mixes of weathered  14  rocks (larger than sand-sized particles) from a variety of sources. They are classified based  on origin, uniformity, texture, depositional mechanism, and presence or absence of a matrix.  These detrital mixes consist of large clasts with or without a muddy or sandy matrix. The  clasts may be of pebble size or larger, and they are often described as conglomerate if  rounded, or breccia if angular. Other terms used in this category include agglomerates, tuffs  and tills. If a volcanic source is known, then some information may be given as to whether  the detrital material is of rhyolitic (higher K) or andesiticlbasaltic (lower K) composition. If  we know that a depositional rock group is primarily of intraformational (local) origin, then  we could probably make a K-elassification call based on the surrounding rock type.  However, our experience indicates that within many depositional rock types (such as alluvial  or glacial deposits), there can be a great deal of variability even within a small unit area.  Therefore, if we have a geologic map unit indicating one of these detrital types and no  detailed description, we really have no way of classifying these rocks.

'Regional' metamorphism refers to large scale metamorphism, while 'contact' or 'local'  metamorphism refers generally to metamorphism on a local scale, usually by contact with  magma or lava from a local intrusion. The'grade' of metamorphism is also often referred  to; the higher the degree of pressure and temperature change, the higher the 'grade' of  metamorphism. High grade metamorphic rocks have undergone high temperature and  pressure changes, and low grade metamorphic rocks have undergone low temperature and  pressure changes. During metamorphism, certain groups of minerals tend to occur  repeatedly, and are known as 'mineral assemblages.' Metamorphic rocks are classified into  groups known as 'facies' according to the development of these mineral assemblages. The  key minerals of a facies are known as the 'index minerals.' Though a rock undergoing  metamorphosis may progress through the various facies, the same elements that we started  with will generally still be there following metamorphism. However, there is a process  known as 'metasomatism' by which new replacement products known as 'skarns' may be  produced during metamorphosis. Metasomatism occurs due to chemical reactions involving  interstitial pore liquids or gases contained in the rock or introduced from outside the rock  body. Metasomatism is often associated with faults and mineral ridge areas, and the  16  replacement products mayor may not contain K.  Textural terms used in conjunction with metamorphic rocks include hornfels, slate,  phyllite, schist, and gneiss, which represent metamorphosed rocks of increasing grain size  and layering from fme through coarse. The tenns 'metacryst' and 'porphyroblast' refer to  large crystals formed in metamorphic rocks by recrystallization. The term 'fabric' refers to  the alignment of the grains in a rock. 'Schist' and 'gneiss' are fabric terms referring to how  closely spaced the 'bands' or layers in a rock are, which in turn relate to the amount of mica  or other platy minerals present. While not a rule, it is generally found that the schists (platy,  narrower bands) are mica-rich and contain &lt;20% feldspars, while gneisses (wider bands)  contain &gt;20%feldspar. If a metamorphic rock is known to have a sedimentary protolith,  then the prefIx 'para-' is used. If an igneous rock was the source, then 'ortho-' is used. So  a gneiss of sedimentary origin is a paragneiss, and one of igneous origin would be an  orthogneiss.  Unfortunately, none of these textural tenns implies the presence of any characteristic  minerals. If a rock is described simply as a 'gneiss' or a 'schist,' we have no way of  classifying that for K content; in other words some descriptor of origin or mineral  constituents is needed. If low-grade metamorphism occurred and the protolith is still  identifIable, then we may classify a metamorphic rock according to its sedimentary, felsic  igneous or mafIc igneous parent rock. Unfortunately, more often than not the protolith is not  identifIable, particularly if a rock has been highly metamorphosed. Therefore, we will more  often have to depend on the geologic map description. Standard metamorphic nomenclature  includes to a list of mineral constituents (the mineral assemblage) placed in front of the rock  17  name. In order to be included in this mineral assemblage, a mineral must comprise more  than 5%by volume of the rock. The minerals are then listed in front of the rock name, in  order of decreasing content. For example, a K-bearing schist might be a 'biotite-garnet­staurilite  schist (biotite is the primary constituent)', while a lower-K schist might be a  'quartz-mica-garnet schist (quartz is the primary constituent, followed by mica).' Due to the  wide variety of potential mineral assemblages, only a few more common metamorphic rocks  will be listed in the summary of K-classification by rock type.  18  Summary of K-groupings:  mGH-K ROCKS: 100 &gt; 3.50 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Acid Igneous Rocks  Plutonic  Nepheline syenite  Alkali granitest syenites  Granite  Quartz syenite  Syenite  Monzonite  Volcanic  Phonolite  Alkali rhyolites, trachytes  Rhyolite  Quartz trachyte  Trachyte  Latite  MEDIUM-K ROCKS: 100 1.76-3.50 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Intermediate Igneous Rocks  Plutonic  Some lower-K granites  Quartz monzonite  Granodiorite  Quartz diorites  Monzodioritet diorite  Volcanic  Rhyodacite  Quartz latite  Dacite  Latite-andesites  Latite-basalt  Medium-K Sedimentaly Rocks  Rock Type Requisites and specific rock types  Mudstones Graywackes; K-clays (illite, sericite, phlogopite, biotite)  predominantt or era Paleozoic and earliert OR no other  information available  Clayey Sandstones  Volcanic  Arkose, graywackes; modifiers micaceous, arkosic, feldspathic t  lithic  Rhyolitic detritus & tuffs  Medium-K Metamomhic Rocks (partial list&gt;  Rock Type Requisites and SJ)eCific rock types  Meta-mudstones Argillite, slate, siltite  Metamorphics Schists, phyllites, gneisses, etc. t WITH modifiers indicating the  presence of high-K minerals: biotite, muscovitet phlogopite, K­feldspars)  19  LOW-K ROCKS: DO &lt; = 1.75 % BY WEIGHT  LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ROCK TYPES:  Basic Igneous Rocks  Plutonic  Tonalite  Low-K quartz diorites  Gabbro, Anorthosite  Peridotite, Pyroxenite  Low-K Sedimentao' Rocks  Rock Tme  Mudstones  Sandstones  Undefmed detritus  Volcanic  Carbonate rocks  Chemical precipitates  Volcanic  Quartz andesite  Andesite  Basalt  Requisites and specific rock types  Graywackes, subgraywackes; K-clays not predominant,  modifiers carbonaceous, siliceous  Arenite, quartzarenite; modifier quartz; anything with the prefIX  sub- (this indicates a high quartz percentage); OR no other  information available  Conglomerates, breccias, agglomerates, tuffs, tills  Andesitic detritus & tuffs  Limestone, dolomite  Ironstones, evaporates, chert  Low-K Metamorphic Rocks (partial list)  Rock Tme Requisites and specific rock types  Meta-sandstones Quartzites  Metamorphics  Hornblendite  Actinolite  Amphibolite  Eclogite  Greenschist  Greenstone  Schists, phyllites, gneisses, etc., WITH modifiers indicating the  presence of low-K minerals: hornblende, chlorite, albite,  epidote)  20  LITERATURE CITED  Battey M.H. 1981.

Springer-Verlag, New  York, 334 p.  A-i  Appendix: Calculation from Modes  Three methods for calculation of weight percent K20 from mineralogical analyses are given  here. Method 1 is quicker, Method 2 is more correct. Results are comparable.  Method la: Direct conversion of mineral percentages to weight percentages using  gravimetric factors ~tro et al 1983)  This method entails the use of gravimetric conversion factors which are based on molecular  equivalents of K20 in specific minerals. A list of ~vimetric conversion factors for  potassium-bearing minerals are given in Table A-I (from Dutro et al 1983). This is the most  straightforward method, and simply involves dividing the reported percentage of each  constituent by its gravimetric factor in order to obtain the equivalent amount of K20. An  example follows:  Example la: From Table 1 on page 4, we have an approximate mineral composition for  granite. Within the list of constituent minerals, we know that potassium occurs in orthoclase  and biotite. We would convert to K20 as follows:  Mineral  Orthoclase  Biotite  Non-K minerals  Description  40%  5%  55%  Gravimetric factor  5.91  8.93  0.00  TOTAL DO  % K20  6.77  0.56  0.00  7.33%  Method Ib: Conversion of mineral percentages to weight percentages using a breakdown of  mineral constituents into individual oxide components (Holmes 1921).  This method consists of first assigning values to the individual components of the mineral  constituents in a given rock, followed by the multiplication of that value by the reported total  amount of that mineral in the rock (Homes 1921). Table A-2 (Grout 1932) lists the  compositions of various rock minerals. NOTE: The values in Table A-2 are also based on  either molecular weights or chemical analyses of the minerals. The equivalent gravimetric  factor (such as that listed above) may be obtained by dividing 100 by the mineral % from  Table A-2. (For example, Orthoclase: 100/16.9 = 5.917, Biotite: 100/11.2 = 8.93, etc.)  Example Ib: Using the same granite listed above and the values from table A-2, the  following conversion would occur:  Mineral  Orthoclase  Biotite  Non-K minerals  Description  40%  5%  55%  %K20 in mineral  crable A-2)  16.9  11.2  00.0  TOTAL DO  %K20  in rock  6.76  0.56  0.00  7.32%  A-ii  Method 2: Conversion of mineral percentages to weight percentages using specific gravity  of the minerals (Holmes 1921), followed by use of method la or Ib above.  *NOTE: This is the more correct method!*  This method involves the conversion of mineral percentages in volume percent to weight  percent estimates using specific gravities of the various minerals. Specific gravities are listed  in most mineraI indices (see Hurlbut & Klein 1989 or 1977). A weighted average is then  compiled for the individual minerals, followed by use of either method la or Ib above. A  number of 'trial runs' using this method indicated that there is minor variation from the use  of straight volume percent values (Methods la and Ib above). This method is more involved  than the first two because in order to derive weighted averages of the minerals, it is  necessary to know all the mineral components of the rock. Following is an example using  the same granite from Table I, page 4:  Example 2:  Granite from Table I Conversion to Weight % Method Ib Method la  Mineral VoI.% Sp.Grav. Wt.

Mika  Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative  University of Idaho  October 29, 1996  In spring of 1995 two fertilizer trials were installed on Boise  Cascade lands in northeast Oregon, one at Clear Creek in a young  Ponderosa pine plantation, the other at Noregaard in a natural  mixed conifer stand. Six growth monitoring plots were established  at each site, three of which were treated with a multi-nutrient  fertilizer; the other three plots remained untreated for use as  experimental controls. Plot sizes of 0.05 and 0.1 acres were used  at the Clear Creek and Noregaard installations, respectively. The  elemental rates of the multi-nutrient fertilizer are shown in  Table I.  Table I.

Analysis of the initial foliar chemistry data was presented  by Terry Shaw (1996). The 1996 collections have not yet undergone  chemical analysis.  At the time of establishment all growth plot trees were examined  for condition and measured for diameter at breast height and total  height. Measurements were taken on 71 and 132 trees and Clear  Creek and Noregaard, respectively. Summaries of this information  were presented by Shaw (1996). Average stand conditions at the  start of the experiment for the two installations are shown in  Table II.  In fall of 1996, two growing seasons after fertilizer application,  all growth plot trees were measured for diameter at breast height.  Tree condition was also recorded. From this data and information  collected at the time of plot establishment, per acre values of  stand size, density, and volume were calculated. Summaries of  this information for the two installations are presented in  Appendix A.  Analysis Methods  Analysis of fertilizer effects on tree growth was made by  comparing growth rates of control and treated plots using analysis  of variance techniques. Two-year basal area growth and change in  quadratic mean diameter were both examined. Basal area growth was  calculated as the difference between initial and two-year total  basal area on each plot; similar calculations were made for mean  diameter change. As no mortality had yet occurred on any of the  plots, there was no need to calculate separate values for gross  and net growth.  Fertilizer effects on basal area growth were estimated using a  randomized block analysis of covariance model. The particular  model fit was (after Federer, 1955):  Yijk = μ + Ii + Fj + βXijk + eijk (1)  where Yijk is the two-year growth for the plot (ie. the kth replicate  of the jth fertilizer treatment within the ith installation), μ is  the overall mean effect, Ii is a random effect due to the ith  installation, Fj is the effect due to the jth fertilizer treatment,  Xijk is the basal area per acre at the start of the experiment for  the plot, β is the coefficient for the regression of growth on  initial basal area, and eijk is a random error effect. A similar  model was used for change in mean diameter, using initial  quadratic mean diameter as the covariate.  Results  Analysis of variance results for two-year basal area growth are  shown in Table III. The overall model was highly significant  (p=0.0035), accounted for 80% of the total variation in basal area  Table I.

The initial  basal area covariate was extremely useful in reducing variation.  After adjusting plots to a common basal area of 39.9 ft2/a, the  multi-nutrient fertilizer was estimated to produce an increase of  2.4 ft2/a over control plot growth rates; this response was highly  significant (p=0.0063).

This  was accomplished by including installation X treatment and  installation X basal area terms in the analysis of covariance  model. Results, shown in Table IV, indicate that basal area  response did not vary significantly between the two sites; the  installation X treatment term was non-significant (p=0.6030) and  any differences by treatment in covariate adjustment were  marginal (p=0.1463). These trends can be seen in the plot data  shown in Figure 1. For both sites, two-year growth rises as  initial basal area increases. The trend may be steeper for the  Clear Creek installation, but not to a significant extent.  Figure 1. Two-year basal area growth versus initial basal area.  Values on the left represent plots at Clear Creek (CC) while  those on the right are from Noregaard (NG).  Two-year basal area growth and response are summarized in Figure  2. Using the parameter estimates given in Table IV, basal area  growth was adjusted to a common initial basal area of 23 ft2/a for  Clear Creek and 57 ft2/a for Noregaard. At those starting  conditions, estimated average control two-year growth was quite  similar for the two sites, 10.6 and 10.1 ft2/a for Clear Creek and  Noregaard, respectively (Figure 2a). The Clear Creek site showed  better growth on the fertilized plots, averaging 13.2 ft2/a versus  12 ft2/a for the Noregaard site. Values for the average were  obtained from parameter estimates given in Table III using an  average initial basal area of 40 ft2/a.  6  8  10  12  14  16  10 20 30 40 50 60 70  Initial Basal Area (ft2/a)  Basal Area Growth  (ft2/a)  CC control CC multi NG control NG multi  Table III.

Because the Noregaard site was growing at a slower  rate, differences between relative responses to fertilization  (Figure 2c) at the two sites were smaller: 24.5 % at Clear Creek  versus 18.8 % at Noregaard. Averaged across the two sites, multi-nutrient  fertilizers produced a 23.5 % increase in basal area  growth.  Analysis of variance results for two-year mean diameter growth,  given in Table V were similar, but stronger; the model was highly  significant (p=0.0001), accounted for 98% of the variation in  diameter growth, and had a low coefficient of variation of 3.4%.  Note that a covariate was not included, as all tested showed lack  of significance. The data plotted in Figure 3 clearly shows the  lack of need for any covariate adjustment for initial diameter:  the trend in growth versus initial diameter is flat for both  sites.  Figure 3.

When expressed as percentages of control change in mean  diameter, the difference in response between the sites is greatly  reduced (Figure 4c): Clear Creek showed a 19.1 % response in mean  diameter while Noregaard showed a 16.9 % response, a reduction of  only 2.2 %.  Figure 4c. Two-year mean diameter % response by site. Response  is the difference between treated and control expressed as a  percentage of control change in mean diameter.  The two sites differed greatly in species composition which could  explain some of the differences in response to fertilization. As  Ponderosa pine made up 99 % of the Clear Creek stand but was  generally absent from the Noregaard site, a direct comparison of  species-specific response between the sites was not possible.  However, possible differences in species response could be checked  at Noregaard. Analysis of covariance indicated that basal area  growth rates did differ significantly (p=0.0074) among species,  with western larch showing slower growth, but there was no  evidence that responses to fertilizer were different (p=0.4736).

Six growth monitoring plots were established  at each site, three of which were treated with a multi-nutrient  fertilizer; the other three plots remained untreated for use as  experimental controls.

Two trees of each of the dominant species (Ponderosa pine  at Clear Creek, Douglas-fir and Grand fir at Noregaard) were  selected on each plot. Current year foliage was collected from  the third whorl. Samples were oven-dried and sent out for  chemical analysis. Statistical analysis of most of the 1995  foliar chemistry data was presented by Terry Shaw (1996).  However, laboratory analysis for sulphur concentrations has only  just been completed. This addendum reports the results of  statistical analysis of this foliar sulphur data. Chemical  analysis of the 1996 collections has yet to be done.  Plot averages for sulphur concentration and content, and  sulphur/nitrogen ratio were calculated by site, species, and  treatment; these, along with nitrogen concentrations and needle  weights, are shown in Table II. Analysis of variance of sulphur  concentration indicated the neither species nor treatment  differences were statistically significant; p-values were 0.1136  for treatment effects and 0.1919 for species differences. The  treatment X species interaction was also non-significant  (p=0.4408). There was a tendency for higher S concentrations in  Grand fir than in Douglas-fir. Ponderosa pine differences with  the other species were totally confounded with site differences  and thus could not be analyzed; control values were similar to  Douglas-fir. The multi-nutrient fertilizer tended to increase S  concentrations in Ponderosa pine and Grand fir, but not in  Douglas-fir.  Sulphur critical levels found in the literature are 0.11 for  Douglas-fir (Webster and Dobkowski 1983), 0.14 for Grand fir  (Powers 1981), and 0.15 for Ponderosa pine (Boyer 1978). Thus,  all foliar S levels at the two sites, even following treatment  with 90 lbs/a of S, were still well below critical.  Sulphur content, expressed in μg/100 needles, differed by species,  reflecting the large differences in needle weight among the  species. However, unlike concentration, there was statistical  evidence of a positive response to multi-nutrient fertilizers:  Ponderosa pine S content increased by 17 %, Douglas-fir by 7 %,  and Grand fir by 28 %, the later being statistically significant  (p=0.001).  Sulphur/Nitrogen ratios showed some species differences: Grand  fir, with its higher S concentrations and lower N concentrations,  had larger S/N ratios than Douglas-fir (p=0.1061). Ponderosa pine  ratios were similar to Douglas-fir. The fertilizer did not  produce any significant change in ratios for all species,  indicating that any increase in N following fertilization was  generally matched by a similar increase in S.

Data and Methods  We used 47,838 trees of ten species with observed  diameter at breast height (dbh, to the nearest 0.1 inch)  outside bark and total height (ht, to the nearest foot for  large trees and to the nearest 0.1 ft for smaller trees) to  develop and test height-diameter equations. The study  area covers western Montana, northeastern Oregon, and  eastern Washington, but most data were from northern  Idaho. The ten tree species are: (1) Western white pine  (Pinus monticola), (2) Western larch (Larix occidentalis),  (3) Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), (4)  Grand fir (Abies grandis), (5) Western hemlock (Tsuga  heterophylla), (6) Western redcedar (Thuja plicata), (7)  Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), (8) Engelmann spruce  (Picea engelmannii), (9) Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa),  and (10) Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). The available  tree height-diameter data were divided into two sets. The  majority of the data (90%) were used for model develop-ment.  Ten percent of the trees were systematically se-lected  across the range of diameters for each species and  reserved for model validation.

For example, the estimated tree height for  a 10 in. grand fir tree was 75 ft from the existing Prognosis  equation, 71 ft from the refitted Wykoff function, and 70  ft from the Lundqvist function.

The plot consists of a central block ( 7 x 7 central) of 49 trees (0)  surrounded by two rows of plot buffer trees, all of which will receive a fertilizer treatment. The  inner row of buffer trees consists of 32 sample trees (®) used for destructive sampling, while  the outer row of buffer trees consists of 40 trees (-Qo) and will serve as a treated buffer. Plot  layout design is shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1.

Sites selected for establishment will have a  paired design with one study site on ''bad rock"" and one study site on ""good rock"" for each stand  type within a local geographic area. Preliminary selection can be accomplished by using  geologic maps to locate rock types of interest on Cooperative ownership. It should be noted that  this stage ofthe selection process can only be accomplished through active communication and  cooperation between Coop members and IFTNC staff.

Paint,  flagging and 4 ' pvc pipe stakes will be used to establish boundaries that will help guide  cooperators in establishing boundaries during the site preparation process. Method of harvesting  and site preparation will vary by site and is the responsibility of each cooperator to accomplish.  General guidelines for this study are:  1. Uniform treatment over entire area.  a. harvesting  b. mechanical  c. burning  2. Treatment area should be large enough to accommodate study area (Figure 3.)  plus one tree length to the nearest timber.  3. Sufficient plantable spots for 4' x 4' spacing.  a. vegetation control (brush, regeneration etc.)  b. minimize woody debris  c. minimize compaction  4. Common treatment for both paired sites (""good rock - bad rock"").  Animal Control  To increase plantation success it is imperative that intensive steps be taken to reduce animal  impact. As in site harvesting and preparation, animal control objectives will require unique  management practices and will be the responsibility of each cooperator involved in the study.  Livestock, big game and gophers are the most common animal pests in plantations. To control  animal activity fencing and rodent extermination practices should be used.  Fencing- A 10' high ""New Zealand"" style electric fence would be the most effective barrier  against livestock and big game activity. Unfortunately, the high financial investment, time  involved to construct and high maintenance of this type of fence system is beyond most  cooperators resources. To meet our exclosure objectives we suggest a 5'-6' (six-strand) barbed  wire fence be constructed. At a minimum, fence dimensions should follow the circumference of  the schematic in Figure 3 (334 x 226). Fence construction should take place after site  preparation and before or immediately after plantation establishment.  Rodent Control - Porcupines, gophers, mice and hares can severely damage or destroy  seedlings in a conifer plantation. This is especially true in research plantation areas where every  seedling represents a significant amount of the study results. Cooperators should use all rodent  control resources available and practice an intensive program to control rodent damage in the  research plantations. Generally, gophers are the main rodent source of seedling damage and  mortality. Gopher activity in a plantation can easily be controlled through a poisoning or  trapping program. Poisoning with strychnine oats is generally the most effective way to control  gopher activity, but requires a licensed pesticide applicator. Treatment for gopher control can  begin any time after plantation establishment. Research areas should be monitored regularly for  reoccurring or increased activity.  Establishment  7  Establishment of research plantations will follow guidelines outlined in the design section of this  text. IFTNC staff will begin establishment as soon as site preparation has been completed in  summer/fall 1997.  Installation layout will be accomplished by establishing a grid-line system. Staff compass, 300'  nylon tapes, 4' pvc pipe, and wire flagging will be used to set-up comers, plantable spots and  plot lines. Four foot pvc pipe will be used to monument the four comers of the installation. Each  comer shall intersect at right angles. To increase efficiency and aid in establishment, the longest  side of the installation (334', Figure 3) should ""preferably"" run horizontal across the slope.  Comer stakes will be painted yellow at the time of establishment.  Once comers are established, one comer will be chosen to serve as a reference point and  respective right-angled baselines (226' parallel to slope and 334' horizontal across slope, Figure  3) for installation of the grid-line system. To increase installation efficiency, an additional  baseline should be established at installation center (172') and should run parallel with the slope  but perpendicular to the 334' foot baseline. Center baseline will be 5' off-set from true center to  account for the buffer distance between treatment plots. Flagging pins will be used to establish  the center baseline. Center baseline pin placement will follow pin placement outlined in the  following paragraph on line establishment. Care should be taken to match flag color patterns  with appropriate colors of lines to be established. Note: installation comers may need to be  adjusted (""Scooched"") to accomplish the ""best fit"" between comers and baseline boundaries.  Line establishment can best be accomplished using a three person system. One person to hold  and stretch (holders) each end of the of the nylon tape and one person setting pins (setter) at the  appropriate spots. The objectives of line establishment are to install buffer boundaries between  treatment plots and position spots for seedling establishment. The staff compass will not be  needed for line establishment. All alignment will be accomplished by tape measurement and by  visually siting down tape lines. The first line will run parallel with the baseline boundary  horizontal across slope and will account for the unplanted and untreated buffer, thus, the starting  point will be 1 0' in from both the horizontal and parallel slope (right-angled) baselines (Figure  4). A measurement tape will be stretch between the starting point and a centerline point located  1 0' in and perpendicular to the baseline horizontal to the slope. The pin setter will start by  placing a flagging pin at the 1 0' buffer comer. Pin placement will continue on line every four  feet for a total of eleven pins, then a 12th pin will be placed after 1 0' more feet. This will  complete a treatment plot with a shared 1 0' buffer and begin a new treatment plot Figures 3 and  4). Note: Interior plot boundaries will share a common 10' buffer. This pattern will continue  8  (one 10'buffer pin with ten 4' spaced pins) for three complete treatment plots (total of 34 pins  with 10' buffers) until center baseline is reached. It is the responsibility of the tape holders to  keep the pin setter in alignment. Flagging pin color should change every 12 pins, with the 12th  pin signifying the start of a new plot (Figure 4). Two flagging pin colors will be used per plot in  a alternate pattern, which will create a checker board appearance upon completion of each  installation grid-line system. Each completed line should be checked for alignment and  accuracy. Continue the line from center baseline to opposite boundary baseline using the same  pin placement pattern. If 334' long lines are used to complete the grid system, a total of 44  lines@ 66 (11 pins x 6 plots) pins/line will be needed to complete a installation (2904 total  pins). After all installation lines have been completed, adjust (scooch) ""out-of-line"" pins by  visually aligning them along horizontal and diagonal rows.

Planting  Plantation success will greatly depend on high quality planting practices. Planting shall take  place in spring of 1998 and will be performed by cooperator personel. IFTNC staff will bring  seedlings to sites for planting. Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedlings will be randomly  assigned by block and planted on a 4' x 4' spacing. Each planting spot will be marked by  flagging stakes that were previously established by IFTNC staff in summer/fall1997. IFTNC  staff will be present to monitor planting technique and procedures.  Fertilization  IFTNC staff will fertilize seedlings in spring/1998, immediately after the seedlings have been  planted. Within each block, one of the six treatments will be randomly assigned to one of the six  plots per block. Two treatment replications per species will be established. Treatment rates are  shown in Table 1.  Fertilizer placement will be accomplished with the use of a dibble bar. Fertilizer will be placed  in a 6 "" deep dibble hole 3"" on the up-hill side of each seedling. Each dibble hole should be  covered with soil after fertilizer placement. Treatments will be measured by volume with a  metered cylinder. The volume of each cylinder will equal each treatment rate in grams.  Retreatment- A second fertilization will be done in the fall of 1999, two years (two growing  seasons) after establishment. Preliminary discussion on treatment design calls for a spot  broadcast application of nitrogen, with the exception of the control plots.  9  Vegetation Management  Vegetation control will be conducted when needed for 3 consecutive growing seasons and will be  the responsibility of each cooperator involved in the study. The goal for this study is to provide a  level of vegetation control that will enable the seedlings to grow and survive without influences  of competing vegetation. The best strategy for successful plantations is to establish seedlings in a  vegetative free environment before competition captures site resources. The application of  herbicides is the most effective way to control competing vegetation. The type of herbicide,  application rate and application time are important factors to successful removal of competing  vegetation. Cooperator's will need to appraise each site to evaluate herbicide needs. General  guidelines for this study are:  1. Application of herbicides should not effect the growth of the seedlings. Great  care should be taken to avoid direct herbicide contact with the seedlings.  2. Use of soil active herbicides should be avoided.  3. Use of foliar active herbicides is recommended.  4. Spot application or broadcast application is acceptable.  5. Treatment should be uniform for each seedling and entire research area.  Measurement and Data Collection  Initial Measurements - Stem caliper and total tree height will be recorded in spring/1998 by  IFTNC staff for all central block (Figure 1) seedlings ( 49) in each treatment plot. A total of 98  trees per treatment per species or grand total of 1176 (98 trees x 12 treatment plots/species) trees  will be measured per installation. Stem caliper will be taken at ground level and will be  recorded to the nearest 1 OOih inch while total height will be recorded to the nearest 1 Olh of a foot.  Defect and causal agent will also be recorded at time of the initial measurements. Information  will be recorded on data recorders using IFTNC software.  Tree Numbering - Each seedling in the plots central block (Figure 1) per plot will be numbered  consecutively by block and plot. For example, the first tree in block 1 and plot 1 will be labeled  111 while the last tree (49) in block 1 and plot 1 will be labeled 1149. The first number  signifying the block the second the plot and the last number the tree. Tree numbering will begin  at 1 and end at 49 for each plot. Orientation for block, plot and tree numbering will always  begin at the upper (slope) left comer of each installation and run from left to right. Figure 3  shows block and plot numbering in relation to slope orientation. Fourteen inch ""pig-tail"" pins  with numbered aluminum tag will be placed on the uphill side of each seedling. Placement of  numbered pins will be completed with initial measurements.  Remeasurement - Stem caliper, total tree height and current leader growth will be measured  from the central block (Figure 1) at the end of the first and second growing seasons, then every  other year to project completion. Mortality and defect by causal agent will be recorded at this  time. Information will be recorded on data recorders using IFTNC software.  Foliage Collection- Current foliage will be collected at the end of the first and second growing  seasons. Five sample trees per plot of will be randomly collected from the inner destructive  sample buffer. Samples will be composited by species, treatment and block for chemical  analysis. Dry needle counts (3 reps of 30) of com posited needles will also be performed.  Drying and needle counting procedures will follow IFTNC standards given in Appendix A.  Rock Collection - Base rock will be collected from each site for geochemical analysis. Rock  will be collected from rock outcrops located in the vicinity. Two samples from each rock  outcrop will be sampled (l weathered, 1 fresh). Dependent upon base rock variability per site,  more than one outcrop may need to be sampled.  10  Site Characteristics - Aspect, slope, elevation, vegetation habitat type, soil profile description  and surface soil samples will be collected for each site during the establishment period. Habitat  type and vegetation determination will be made using manuals specific to the region. Soil profile  description and surface soil sampling will follow IFTNC guidelines given in Appendix A.  In addition, detailed notes and sketch will be made on site of pertinent site information and  installation layout (plot and block orientation, landmarks, insect and disease activity, stand  information, site conditions etc.). Written directions to the site from a prominent place in the  area and legal description will be provided. Each installation will be well monumented with  IFTNC research area tags.  11  APPENDIX A  IFTNC  SEEDLING FOLIAGE COLLECTION PROCEDURE  Time of Samplin&  Collection shall take place after dormancy begins in the fall (Sept., Oct., Nov ... ). An  entire installation should be completed during one continuous time block. If time  schedules permit, collect samples for each installation during the same time of the day (ie.  morning or afternoon).  Seedling Selection  Randomly select five seedlings from the destructive sample buffer for each plot.  Foliage Collection  Foliage is collected from the current years growth. The entire seedling current year  growth will be sampled and composited in a labeled bag.  Foliage Sample Storage  Immediately place foliage in roomy plastic bags (ziplocks) and store in an iced cooler.  Imprint each sample bag with date, installation name and number, plot number and tree  identification number. Samples should not be stored in field coolers over three to four  days. Bring samples in from the field for processing as soon as possible! Note: Samples  may be stored for longer periods (months) as long as storage temperatures are below  freezing.  NEEDLE DRYING AND GRINDING PROCEDURE  I. Remove green foliage samples from the cooler or freezer. Foliage samples should not be  taken out of cold storage unless they are to be dried or processed immediately. Only  remove enough foliage from cold storage that can be processed within a couple of hours.  Green foliage samples should be stored at I o c or colder while awaiting the drying process.  Ultra-cold ( -30° c) storage should be used if samples are to be in prolonged storage.  2. Carefully strip needles from stem at the base of the needle where attached to the stem,  making sure not to damage or break needles. Extreme care should be used if sample  quantities appear to be small. When stripping pine spp. needles the stripped needle should  include the fascicle bundle containing the needles.  3. Place stripped needles into marked paper bags by installation, plot and tree. Dry in a forced  air oven for 24 hours at 70° c.. Larger samples may need longer drying periods and should  be mixed periodically to achieve uni:from and proper dryness.  4. After drying the needles place 2-3 grams (1/2 cup) into coffee grinder and reduce to a  fine dust. This process can be expedited by shaking the coffee grinder. To prevent  a spill make sure the coffee grinder lid is secure or that lid is held on tightly.  5. After grinding carefully brush contents into small plastic bags. Extra care should be used  not to spill ground sample when removing the lid of coffee grinder or while brushing out  material. Any spilt ground foliage material is considered contaminated and should be  discarded. Between each sample processed clean coffee grinder, brush and work area  by blowing out excess material with a air hose and then wiping clean with a alcohol soaked  towel.  6. Record full tree number (includes installation, plot, and tree number, whorl number (if  given), species, date and your initials on each bag with a permanent marker.  Ex. (Inst) - 242*  (Block)- 2*  (Plot) - 6*  (Tree) - 193*  (Whorl) - 4W  (Species)- DF  (Initial)-MM  (Date) - 9/10/92  *242-2-6-193  NEEDLE COUNTING PROCEDURE  1. From each bag (which represents one sample from one tree) 3 replications of 30 needles are  to be counted. Use a sequence of3 weighing tins (i.e. 25, 26, 27) for each sample.  2. Wipe out residue from weighing tins if necessary.  3. Count needles for each installation in order, plot 1 first, plot 2 next, etc.  4. Record full tree number (includes installation, block, plot, and tree number, whorl number  (if given), initials of counter, date counted, and the 3 corresponding tin numbers.  Leave a space between entrees.  Ex. (lnst) - 242  (Block)- 2  (Plot) - 6  (Tree) - 187  (Whorl) - 4W  (Initial)- MM  (Date) - 9/10  242-6-193  JMM9/10  (SPACE)  (SPACE)  5. Shake bag of needles to mix samples thoroughly.  (Tin#)  25  26  27  28  29  30  6. Take out bunch of needles and spread out on desktop. A white background is helpful.  7. Count out needles in 10 groups of 10. Start counting from one side of pile (right side for  right-handed persons). Do not count diseased, broken, or abnormally small needles.  8. Put 30 needles in tin, making sure not to lose any.  9. Mix up pile of needles and repeat steps 7 & 8 until 3 tins of 30 have been counted. Note:  some samples may need to be composited. Consult project design or check with supervisor  before processing.  I 0. Record % of disease incidence.  II. Tins may be stacked (in 3's) on tray to facilitate transfer to oven.  12. Place tins singly (unstacked) on oven trays. Dry the needles at 68°C (check thermometer on  top of oven, not the dial on front of oven) for at least 12 hours (overnight). Put clamps,  pliers, or whatever next to outside row of tins to keep them from being blown around by  fan.  13. After 12+ hours, turn oven off and wait until the fan stops completely before opening -  otherwise the samples may be blown around. Open door~ slowly.  14. Take samples out of oven, stack 3 tins from each sample, and place immediately in  desiccator to prevent trees absorbing moisture from the air. Place tins on only one tray of  desiccator.  NEEDLE WEIGHING PROCEDURE  1. Zero the scale before each use. Use knob on back right-hand side of scale. Thereafter,  rezero the scale every §. weighings.  2. Open desiccator door, remove one tin with needles, close desiccator door, open scale door,  place tin (with needles) on pan, close scale door, weigh sample to 4 decimal places (i.e.  2.4132 grams).  3. Record weight - make sure it is recorded in the right spot in data book.  4. Turn off balance (arrest lever in ""up"" position ).  5. Remove tin and place in lower tray in desiccator.  6. Repeat steps 2-5 for remaining two tins. Tins can be stacked on lower tray indesiccator.  Continue until all samples weighed.  7. When done weighing all tins with needles:  a) Label zip-lock bags (use Sharpie pen) with: installation, block, plot, tree # and needles  in bag (#90).  Ex. 242-2-6-198  #90  b) Take all 3 stacked tins from desiccator and put needles in labeled bag. Do this on, or  over, a tray so spilled needles will not drop to floor. Close opening on whirly bag.  c) Replace stack of3 tins in desiccator (upper tray).  d) Repeat steps a-c until all samples are bagged.  e) Place all the samples from one installation in large (1-gallon) zip-loc bags with  installation # and supervisors name written on it.  Ex. Installation 24 7  Joe Needlehead  8. After all samples are bagged, reweigh the empty tins (which have been in the desiccator),  again making sure weights are recorded in the correct spot in the data book.  Soil Sampling and Description  Surface SoU Sampling  One sample will be collected from each plot using the soil auger. The sample will be  taken from the upper 10"" of mineral soil near each plot center. Before taking the core  sample, remove any litter or duff from the soil surface. Avoid taking the sample where  trees are decaying or any other irregularities. Composite all sample by plot for the  installation in a plastic bucket and mix. Remove a sample from the bucket and place it in  a single zip-lock bag. Label the bag with installation number and name and date of  sample.  Soil Pit Sampling  At each site, dig a pit down to bedrock, hardpan, restrictive layer or to unaltered parent  material, whichever comes first. Using the Soil Profile Description form, describe the  soil horizons present, the depths of each, and the characteristics of the peds in each  horizon. Note any soil characteristics that may be pertinent to understanding the quality  of the site. Include any surface ash layer in the comments .  . . • ? ....... s.aemm.

La repartition de la croissance en surface terriere aI'interieur d'un peuplement a la suite de travaux sylvicoles a ete etudiee a l'aide d'une fonction « taille relative-croissance relative » (RSG).

The plots each contain at least 10 Douglas-fir sample trees and were selected to minimize among-plot variation in terrain, vegetation composition, tree stocking, and tree size. Plots were grouped into two blocks of three plots based on simi­larity of these features to further reduce variation. Three fertilizer treatments (0, :200, and 400 Ib/acre of nitrogen) (lIb = 0.454 kg) were randomly assigned to the plots within each block. Nitrogen in the form of urea was applied in the late fall utilizing handheld spreaders. All live trees were measured every 2 years for diameter (to the nearest 0.0 I in.) (I in. = 2.54 cm) for a 6-year growth period. Most of these stands had been thinned 5-12 years prior to fertilizer treat­ments between 1980 and 1982; other stands were unthinned, but naturally well spaced. The data cover a wide range of stand densities, tree ages and sizes, and site productivities (Table I).  Model development  The RSG .fill1ctiol1 for tree basal area distribution  Since silvicultural treatments may influence tree stem profile, we decided to work with basal area relative size ­relative growth (RSG) relationships rather than volume RSG function. Relative basal area growth (RBAG) is defined as the ratio of individual tree basal area growth to stand total basal area growth (i.e., the sum of the individual trees) on a unit area. Relativc basal area (RBA) is defined as the ratio  TABLE I.

Since the frequency distributions of tree volume and basal area·have similar patterns, but different degrees of skewness (Hara 1984a, 1984b), the RSG relationships for tree volume and basal area should be similar. Thus, the RSG function for tree basal area distribution was expressed as a quadratic equation relating RBAG to RBA:  [II RBAG = f3() + f3IRBA + f3cRBAc  where f3(). f3 1, and f3 2 are coefficients to be estimated for each plot. This form is analogous to the RSG function for volume in Zhang et al. (I 993a). 400  CAN. J. FOR. RES. VOL. 24, 1994  The prediction models for the three coefficients (~o' ~ I' and ~2) of the RSG function were developed as a recursive sys­tem (see Zhang et al. (l993a) for more statistical detail regarding parameter estimation methodology). Stand attrib­utes representing stand growth stages, tree competition, and variability of tree size were used as predictor variables in the recursive system:  ~I =f(N, QMD, CV)  ~2 =f(~l' N, QMD, CV)  ~o =f(~"" ~2' N, QMD, CV) where N is initial stand density (trees per acre), QMD is initial quadratic mean diameter (in.), and CV is the coeffi­cient of variation (%) of initial tree basal area distribution for a plot.  Characteristics of the unfertilized plot RSG function  The RSG function (eq. 1) was fitted to the 6-year growth data from each of 188 unfertilized plots. The Pearson's cor­relation coefficients between 188 pairs of the three coeffi­cients were -0.86 (~o vs. ~I)' 0.58 (~o vs. ~2)' and -0.88 (~I vs. ~2)' respectively. Generally, if ~I equals one, both ~o and ~2 are nearly equal to zero; if ~ I is less than one, both ~o and ~2 are positive; and in contrast, if ~ I is larger than one, both ~o and ~2 have negative values. The above relationships represent three basic shapes of the RSG func­tion for tree basal area distribution: linear, convex, and con­cave, determining the future frequency distribution of tree basal area to be symmetric, positively skewed, and nega­tively skewed, respectively (Zhang et al. 1993a).  Prediction models for the RSG function coefficients Prediction model for ~ J  The linear coefficient 131 of the RSG function was related to three stand variables (N, QMD, and CV) using nonlin­ear least squares regression, resulting in  [2] 131= N[l -exp( -O.O~~QMD)]  The asymptotic standard error of the estimated parameter was 0.000 831 4. The R2 of the model was 0.84 (R2 for this nonlinear model is defined as 1 -(SSerro/SStotal))' Local minimum problems were not found in parameter estima­tion. Residual analysis showed no significant violation of nonlinear least squares assumptions.  Prediction model for ~2  The prediction model for the quadratic coefficient ~2 was developed using the linear ~I' N, and QMD as independent variables. The CV was tested and found statistically non­significant in the model. The final prediction equation was  [3] ~2 =6.7224 -1O.691O~1 + 0.002213 N  + 0.2526QMD  All independent variables were statistically significant (a =0.05). The R2 of the model was 0.78 and the root mean squared error was 3.02. We could not detect significant vio­lations of ordinary least squares assumptions. The diagnos­tics indicated that no multicollinearity problems existed among the independent variables since the largest condi­tion number was 16.8 (Meyers 1986).  Prediction model for 130  The coefficient ~o was related to both the linear coeffi­cient ~I and quadratic coefficient ~2 of the RSG function, as well as to the three stand variables. However, the CV was also statistically nonsignificant in this equation. The final prediction model for ~o was  [4] ~o = 0.032 85 -0.039 26 ~I -0.001 655 ~2  + 0.000 006 392 N + 0.000 649 6 QMD  All independent variables were statistically significant (a =0.05). The R2 of the model was 0.90 and the root mean squared error was 0.0041. The largest condition number was 18.3 indicating that no multicollinearity problems among the independent variables were diagnosed. Residual analy­sis showed no significant violations of ordinary least squares assumptions.  Model assessment  Fertilization effects  Nitrogen has been identified as a growth-limiting nutri­ent for interior Douglas-fir. Nitrogen fertilization can signif­icantly increase basal area and volume growth over a 6-year period following treatments (Moore et al. 1991). Shafii et al. (1990) found that nitrogen fertilization impacts the absolute change in diameter growth distribution across tree size classes within a stand. Initial tree size and initial stand den­sity produce significant interactions on an individual tree's response to fertilization. Thus, one objective of this study was to investigate the potential RSG function differences between unfertilized and fertilized plots and between levels of fer­tilization treatments.  A total of 350 nitrogen treatment plots from the IFTNC data were used to test and evaluate the RSG function, 175 plots for each of 200 and 400 Ib N/acre treatments, respectively. Mensurational characteristics of the three fer­tilizer treatment plots (0, 200, and 400 lb N/acre) are essen­tially identical since the data were derived from a silvi­cultural experiment designed to make the plots similar. The RSG function (eq. 1) was fitted to the 6-year growth data from each fertilized plot. The characteristics of the RSG function and relationships between the three coefficients for the fertilized plots were compared with those for the unfertilized plots.  The Pearson's correlations between the three coefficients of the RSG function for 200 and 400 lb N/acre treatment plots were nearly identical to those of the control plots. Correlations between ~o and ~ I' and between ~ I and ~2 are strongly negative. The positive correlation between ~o and ~2 is relatively weak. Importantly, the relationships between the RSG coefficients for 0, 200, and 400 lb N/acre plots were also nearly identical.  Statistical analyses were conducted to test the effects of fertilization treatments on the RSG function. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed on the three coefficients of the RSG function from all unfertilized and fertilized plots. The p-values for F approximations of Wilks' ~, Pillai's Trace and HoteHing-Lawley Trace were all approximately 0.63, thus' the treatments were not significantly different. Analysis of covariance (test for heterogeneity of slopes) was also conducted to test the differences of the RSG rela­tionships among the three fertilization treatments. The RSG function (eq. 1) was fitted to combined observations of three plots within a block. Fertilization treatment was coded as an indicator variable. For 92% of the installations, F·tests were statistically insignificant (a = 0.05) for the three coef­ficients of the RSG function. MOORE ET AL. 401  TABLE 2.

Therefore, it appears that the RSG function developed for the unfertilized plots can be used for fertilization treatments within single species, even-aged stands. Fertilization increases stand total growth and accelerates tree differentiation, but does not affect the distribution of tree basal area growth within a stand. The contribution of an individual tree's growth to stand growth is a function of its relative size in the stand. Thus, the additional growth due to fertilization can be disaggregated to individual trees using the previously developed RSG function. However, the characteristic pat­terns of within-stand growth depend on stand conditions such as density and structure.  Thinning effects  Thinning is also an important intermediate silvicultural practice. The type and intensity of thinning directly alter mean tree size, stand density and structure, and, depending on application, stimulates growth of the remaining trees. For example, thinning from below reduces stand density, increases mean tree size and truncates the frequency distri­bution of tree size from the left. Changes in tree basal area distribution due to thinning can be reflected in the shape and curvature of the RSG function, since the prediction models for the three coefficients (eqs. 2, 3, and 4) were developed as functions of initial stand density, mean tree size. and variability of tree size. Thus, the RSG function is formulated to include the effects of density management manipulations on stand dynamics and tree growth within a stand.  Long-term growth data from thinned plots where the trees were measured before and after treatment would be highly desirable for testing the RSG function's ability to represent thinning effects on the distribution of growth within a stand. Unfortunately, such data were not available. Thus, we have chosen to assess the behavior of the RSG function in rep­resenting thinning effects in two ways: (i) comparison of before and after thinning stand structure and consequent predicted RSG function and (ii) comparison of actual and pre-  area grov,lh.

The following example iHustrates the behavior of the RSG function in representing thinning effects on within-stand distribution of growth. We took an actual tree list from an unthinned plot and removed trees both from above and below such that the residual total basal area was nearly identical. Stand variables before and after simulated thin­nings are provided in Table 2. The appropriate resultant stand variables were then input to eqs. 2, 3, and 4 to obtain predicted RSG function (eq. I) parameters for the lll1thinned plot and the' simulated thinnings from above and below. The predicted parameters are also provided in Table 2, and the resultant RSG functions are illustrated in Fig. 2. Thinning from below has shifted the range of RBA such that the trees now span from 0.024 to 0.060 versus from 0.004 to 0.045 for the unthinned and thinned from above treatments. For illus­tration, two trees were selected from the actual tree list. Tree 235 was one of the larger trees (RBA = 0.032) in the unthinned stand (Table 3, Fig. 2). After thinning (both from above and below) its RBA changed to the same value (0.043). 402  CAN. J. FOR. RES.

Model validation  Independent validation data with a 6-year growth period were also obtained from three separate sources to test the RSG function behavior, including various thinning and fer­tilization treatment combinations. A total of 50 plots consisted of six silvicultural treatments: control (unfertilized); fertil­ized with nitrogen at 3 different rates (lOa, 200, and 400 Ib N/acre); thinned only; and thinned and fertilized with 200 Ib N/acre. These testing plots covered a broad range of tree sizes, stand densities and structures, including thinning from below and mechanical thinning. In addition, the plots with  ,~ (b)  11 13  1517 19  13  thinning treatments were thinned immediately prior to the growth period under study in contrast with the development data, wherein the thinnings occurred at least 5 years prior to the analysis growth period. This provides an additional test of the ""robustness"" of the RSG function. However, actual tree lists prior to the thinning treatments are not available from these data. Certain mensurational characteristics for each of the silvicultural treatments are shown in Table 4.  The three coefficients of the RSG function were estimated for each plot based on the stand variables at the beginning of the 6-year growth period using eqs. 2, 3, and 4 to obtain predicted RBAG for each tree. These predicted individual tree RBAGs were applied to actual 6-year stand basal area growth to obtain predicted 6-year individual tree basal area incre­ments. This predicted tree basal area growth was then COlll­pared with corresponding observed tree basal area growth. Prediction error is the difference between observation and pre­diction. Positive enor values are underprediction and negative values are overprediction. 404  CAN. J. FOR. RES. VOL. 24,1994  The prediction error was calculated for each tree and then averaged Jor each plot and treatment. Since the distribu­tions of the observed tree basal area growth and prediction error for some plots were asymmetric, both the means and medians of the observed 6-year basal area growth and pre­diction error for each treatment and across all treatments are provided in Table 5, The validation results indicated that the RSG function produced very small prediction errors across all silvicultural treatments (less than 0.1 % of the observed mean basal area growth). The percentages of the prediction error for the treated plots were very similar to those for the control plots, and there was no particular pat­tern for different treatments. If median terms were used, the RSG function overpredicted tree basal area growth by  2  O.0044ft2 (I ft2 ' 0.09 m ) (8.5% of the observed median tree basal area growth across all treatments).  The performance of the RSG function across diameter classes within a stand was also examined for all plots. To illustrate the RSG function prediction behavior, one plot was selected for each of the silvicultural treatments such that the prediction error of the selected plot was similar to the mean prediction error for the corresponding treatment. For each of the six plots, the observed and predicted 6-year basal area growth of individual trees were categorized into 2-inch diameter classes for initial tree diameter. A cumu­lative frequency distribution of the predicted basal area growth was plotted and compared with that for the observed basal area growth (Fig. 3). The graphs show that the distributions of the predicted basal area growth are similar to those of the observed basal area growth in both levels and shapes. The observed and predicted curve shapes vary according to stand density and structure for each plot.  Conclusions Validation results indicated that the RSG function per­formed well for distributing stand basal area growth to indi­vidual trees following silvicultural treatments. The similar­ities in shapes between the observed and predicted basal area growth showed that the RSG function reasonably rep­resented within-stand basal area growth across diameter classes. These silvicultural treatments did not change the relationship between relative tree basal area growth and relative tree basal area, and did not alter the characteristic relationships between average tree size, stand density and structure represented in egs. 2, 3, and 4. There is no need to develop treatment specific RSG functions. Thinning immediately alters stand density, mean tree size, and stand structure. Artificial reductions in stand density influence competitive status of individuals and enable the remaining trees to accelerate their occupancy of growing space and their diameter growth. Changes in these stand variables are directly incorporated into estimating the coef­ficients of the RSG function. Fertilization treatments do not directly change tree basal area distribution within a stand, but accelerate tree growth and thus speed up the rate of crown differentiation. A tree's response to fertilization depends on its initial size, since larger trees in a stand produce more  absolute growth response than smaller trees (Shafii et al. 1990). Our results suggest that if a tree is growing rela­tively well prior to fertilization, its response after treatment will be proportional to its prior relative growth. The absolute growth effects of these silvicultural treatments would need to be first estimated at the stand level. Growth could sub­sequently be distributed to a list of individual trees using the RSG function.

By locating  our study sites on ezistiDg geologic maps compiled by the United States  Geologic Survey (USGS), we estimated the x: Content of the rocks at each  I&gt;oIJgbIs.& atndy site. The graDite rocks were estimated to have about  twice the Ie ccmtent of the basalts (Ffgme 3), which iDitiaUy seems counter  to exp1ahting the observed II respcmae results for the two rock types.  Howeva; It availability to trees depends on~than just rock K content.  Buol et al. (1989) show tbat granite rocks weather into coarse. sandy soils  with low base status. while basalts weather Into fine, clay sails with high  base status. Buol et al.'s observations are ccmfirmed by analysis of soil  samples collected from the unfertilized plota of the IFTNC Doug:l4s·fir  study sites. Soils derived from basalts had about twice the exchangeable Ie  of soils derived from granites~4).

DougW;·fir  growing on baaaIt soils ueragedfoliar Kconcentration of about 8000  PPM. wbile those growIDg on granite soils averaged about 6000 PPM.  Statistically sfgnifirmrt, these ccmcentratioD differences are likely to be  biologica1ly significant as weD: research indicates that 8000 PPM is an  adequate foliar Kconceutration for Doug1as.~ while 6000 PPM is  inadequate (Webster and Dobkowski 1983).  We believe that soils developed from certain parent materials.  granites in this eumple, are UDable to supply sufficient K to meet the  demands of the stand. Potassium deficiencies became very apparent,  resulting in aigDificantly increased mortalit¥ rates (·square death- within  plot boundaries) afterNdeficiencies were eUmjnated byNfertilization.  Potassium defic:iency has been shown to affect plant resistance to insects  and diseases (Moore et aL 1994, Vanduk and Moore 1994, Huber and  Amy 1985).  113  Session Four  CJsslwn level  Hi'  ~,.....( l.cNI  _Medlum  _OpenWBter  _ Uncletenrined  Forest Health and Potassium Deficiencies  Based on these ez:perlmental results, the IFTNC member  organizations began to wonder if the substantial forest health prob­lems  in the inland Northwest could be associated with wide-scale Ie  deficiencl.es.

Douglas-fir and Ponderosa Pine Growth and Biochemical Response to Various Multinutrient Fertilizer Treatments,"Shaw, T.M.","Nearly all forest sites in the Inland Northwest are nutrient deficient, usually for nitrogen (N) but sometimes other nutrients as well.

Availability of nu1rients can dramatically  change biomass and nutrient allocation within seedlings and in turn change  the rate of leaf, root or stem production and tree survival (lngestad and Lund  1979). 'free growth and nutrient uptake responses to fertilizers are compli­cated  and vary constantly with many factors. Nutrients and their interactions  are a major determinant of tree growth and survival, successful management  of new plantations must consider the nutrient environment.  A number of studies have demonstrated that deficiencies in nutrients  result in reduced tree vigor and increased susceptibility to disease (Stakman  and Harrar 1957, Matson and Waring 1984, Entry et al. 1991a) as well as to  some insects (Mattson 1980, Joseph et al. 1993, Mika and Moore 1994).  Plants growing in suboptimal nutrient conditions become stressed and may  alter the production of chemical defenses (White 1984, Waring and Pitman  1985, Bryant et al. 1987). Nitrogen nu1rition has been a main focus in many  nutrient stress/defense chemical studies (Larsson et al. 1986, Entry 1991b).  However, few studies have been conducted that address seedling growth and  defense chemical relationships to other mineral nutrients such as potassium.  In 1980, a group of forestry organizations formed the Intermountain  Forest 'Iree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) to study forest tree nutrition in the  Inland Northwest region. Initial efforts were concentrated on studying the  effects of N fertilization on growth and survival of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir  (Pseudotsuga menzitsii var. glauca (Mirb.) Franco). Initial results showed that N  fertilization increased tree growth (Moore et al. 1991). However. the initial  results also indicated that mineral nutrient factors other than N might also  limit tree response and survival Upon investigation of all macro and micro  foliar nutrient concentrations only K was present in levels thought to limit  tree growth (Mika and Moore 1991b). Furthermore, evidence showed that low  K levels, either naturally occurring or induced by additions of N, were related  to poor N fertilizer response and high incidence of mortality (Mika and Moore  1991b).  Results from Entry et al. J1991b) may explain the physiological basis for  the IFTNC results. Entry et al. (1991b) conducted a nutrition/root disease  study in thinned and/or fertilized second-growth stands of Rocky Mountain  Douglas-fir located in the Inland Northwest Enhy's investigation involved  some of the same stands studied by the IFTNC cooperative. Results from  Entry's study found significant changes in growth. root balk chemistry and  incidence of infection of .Amu1laria ostoyae associated with N fertilizer amend­ment.  145  Session Four  Results from further IFTNC investigations (Moore et al. 1994, IFTNC  1994, 1996) into N, K and other mineral nutrient treatments have consistently  demonstrated that nutrient deficiencies result in reduced tree vigor and  altered tree chemistcy. Further investigations into the effects of mineral  nutrition on tree growth and tree chemistcy are now being undertaken.  Results from two IFTNC studies are presented in this paper. The first  contains the final results from a three year nurse:ry study on Douglas-fir  seedlings under various N and K treatments, while the second includes first  year growth effects from an ongoing ponderosa pine controlled-release  fertilizer field study.  Douglas-fir Seedling Response Under Various N and K Treahnents  146  In general, few studies, if any, have been conducted that have specifi·  cally addressed Douglas-fir seedling growth and development under high  (luxu:ry) and low (stressed) N and K treatments. However, evidence from  several IFTNC Douglas-fir fertilization field studies (Mika and Moore 1991b,  Moore et al. 1994) have shown evidence that low K levels, either naturally  occurring or induced by additions of N, were related to growth response and  the production of root defense chemistry. To further investigate the role of N  and K nutrition, Douglas-fir seedlings were grown in a nurse:ry shadehouse  environment designed to meet two main objectives: 1) to determine the effects  of N and K nutrition on Douglas-fir foliar nu1rient concentrations, plant growth  and carbon allocation patterns; and 2) to determine the effects of N and K  nutrition on Douglas-fir root storage and chemical composition. Table 1 shows  the nutrient treatments under which the Douglas-fir seedlings were grown.  Table 1.

Results from this  sub-sample showed that the dry matter stem, needle  and root allocation pattems matched the allocation  patterns !_Iom the entire population. SeecDing growth  and carbon allocation between the stems, roots and  needles showed little effect from the K treatments.  Nutrient Treatment  Figure 1. Dry matter aHocation to the roots, stems and needles  differed significantly by treatment.  A tree's abilizy to resist a particular kind of  stress can be assessed by evaluating how easily it can  mobilize carbohydrate reserves near the points of  potential need (Waring and Schlesinger 1985). Also,  competition for resources may affect the levels of  l~7  Session Four  (  storage carbohydrates in various tissues (Waring and Schlesinger 1985). 4  Concentrations of root storage and defensive compounds such as sugar,  starch, phenolics and protein-precipitable tannins in this study's Douglas-fir  seedlings were significantly higher at the root collar sample than in the root  tip area (Table 3). Furthermore, tree root storage and defensive compound  ratios may influence a plant's ability to resist attack from disease and insects.  For instance, Enby et al. (199lb) found a strong correlation of incidence of  infection and phenolic to sugar ratios. Root collar phenolic to sugar ratios  (P:S) in this study were higher than in the root tips, especially in the plants  receiving the HNLK treatment, with the P:S ratio more than twofold lower in  the root tips than the root collar (Table 3). Although sugar, starch, phenol and  tannin concentrations were substantially higher in the root collar than in the  root tip, the results show similar root chemistry trends by treatment. Observa-tions  from the two sampling locations were highly correlated with correlation  coefficients for sugar of r = 0.8476, starch r = 0. 7872, phenol r = 0.9296 and  tannin r = 0.8936.  In this study, root tip starch concentrations were significantly higher  (35%) under the low-N treatments, whereas sugar concentrations were lower  for those plants receiving the same treatments. Seedlings receiving the high  N -low K treatment had significantly lower concentrations of phenolics and  protein precipitable tannins and lower ratios of defensive compounds to  carbohydrates than seedlings receiving the high K treatments. This study  . shows that N and K imbalances led to secondary product imbalances, which  may decrease resistance to disease.  Table 3.

Considering that most site factors contributing to loss of  fertilizer in soils are directly related to rapid dissolution and hydrolysis.  Decisions must be made regarding the source, the amount applied. and the  application time. This study considered the impacts on tree growth from  different fertilizer release rates and application rates of several kinds of  fertilizers. The objectives of this study are: 1) to determine the optimal rate of  a complete fertilizer for establishment and early growth; and 2) to evaluate  the effects of different nutrient release characteristics.

New IFTNC Seedling Research  In 1995, observations from IFI'NC studies suggested a link between  forest health and existing bed rock. Forest stand mortality tended to be higher  on certain rock types with poor K status. In order to better understand and  evaluate this phenomenon, and continue the ongoing evaluation of growth  response to fertilization. a study focusing on rock types and forest health was  developed. In 1996 cooperative members of the IFTNC steering committee  directed IFTNC staff to establish 12 seedling research trials with the main  objective to establish experimental areas which will study the effects of  mineral nutrition on tree health and vigor within seedling establishment  stands on different mineralogy (""good and bad"") of underlying rock.  A randomized block design with two replicates of two species (Douglas­fir,  ponderosa. pine) and six slow release fertilizer treatment combinations was  used. Table 5 shows the slow release fertilizer treatments.

Nutrient deficiencies and imbalances result in reduced tree growth and  differences in carbon allocation to storage and secondary compounds. IFI'NC  studies have shown that N and K imbalances resulted in decreased growth  and changes in storage and secondary compounds. High and low N treatments  caused clear growth and carbon allocation differences. In addition, N nutrition  influenced levels of root storage compounds. K supply had little if any effect  on growth rates or carbon allocation to stems, roots or needles. K shortages,  however, reduced production of plant defensive compounds. These preliminary  results indicate that it may be possible to grow plants with optimal growth  and allocation patterns while controlling different root chemical properties.  Deficient and imbalanced nutrition are natural and common in forest  stands. However, forest practices may augment nutrient imbalances and  deficiencies in forest stands by removal or redistribution of substantial  amounts of biomass. Forest managers should consider the nutritional potential  of a site as a significant factor in making silvicultural decisions. Studies have  shown that forest sites lack sufficient mineral nutrients to express maximum  tree growth and suvival. Higher seedling productivizy and survival may be  achieved if improved and balanced mineral nutrition can be used to regulate  growth and allocation of resources to storage and secondary compounds.

Response of Planted Ponderosa Pine Trees to Slow Release Fertilizers,"Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.","Nutrient availability has long been recognized as a limiting factor to plant growth (Luxmoore et al. 1993). In the Pacific Northwest, of the elements needed for tree growth, nitrogen is the only one that is consistently deficient in the forests of the Northwest (Cole, et al., 1992). Foliage samples collected from 90 fertilizer trials in Douglas-fir scattered across eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, Idaho and western Montana showed nitrogen concentrations of unfertilized trees to be quite low throughout the area (Mika and Moore, 1990). Foliar analysis has also shown severe to very severe nitrogen deficiencies to be common in lodgepole pine stands throughout the interior of British Columbia (Ballard, 1986) and in many ponderosa pine (Powers et al. 1988) and true fir (Powers, 1981) stands in California and Oregon. No other nutrients have been found generally lacking over such large areas and wide range of conditions. Since early work by the College of Forestry, University of Washington, in the1950's, wide-scale testing with nitrogen has been used to develop response predictions. Currently, however, most information on application rates has been based on broadcast application of soluble nitrogen sources. Very little or no information is available on effects of slow release sources on growth of ponderosa pine, especially using a dibble technique. Therefore, the objectives of this study are:  1) to determine the optimum rate of a complete fertilizer to assure rapid tree establishment and early development during the first four years following outplanting;  2) to evaluate the effects of different nutrient release characteristics on plant performance, especially on the root system and  3) to determine correlation of nutrient concentrations from tissue analysis with nutrient application rate and seedling growth rates.  The experiment, if successful, will provide a practically economic and efficient fertilization method to ensure rapid growth and a higher nutrient uptake rates of after planting ponderosa pine.",1998-04-14,,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Fan, Z., J.A.

The studies were conducted in northeastern Oregon and in central Washington by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (lFTNC) in cooperation with the Umatilla and Okanogan National Forests. Four tree species were evaluated for nutrient uptake: Pseudotsuga menzeisii (Douglas-fir), Abies grandis (grand fir). Pinus eontona (lodgepole pine), and Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine). The fertilization treatments were nitrogen (N), nitrogen with potassium (K), and nitrogen with sulfur (5). One intent of the research was to determine whether fertilizing these stands would help basten the rotation and bring them into production sooner by increasing growth rates and decreasing mortality rates.

Post fertilization nitrogen, sulphur and potassium foliar nutrient  concentrations were examined for several species of conifers. This study found grand fIr  (Abies grandis) foliar nitrogen uptake and potassium levels were higher than compared  species Douglas-fIr (pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa) and  lodgepole pine (pinus contorta var. latifolia). Douglas-fir foliar nutrient concentrations  were higher than ponderosa pine or lodgepole pine. The addition of nitrogen alone tends  to cause a decrease in foliar potassium levels for all the species examined. Increases in  nitrogen foliar concentrations were consistently higher on the nitrogen alone treatments than  the nitrogen plus sulphur treatments.  Methods  Study Area  The study is located in the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon and southeast Washington.  By design, the eight study sites were established on four ranger qistricts within the Umatilla  National Forest. The four ranger districts are Heppner, Pendleton, Pomeroy and Ukiah. Appendix  1. shows the installation locations in northeast Oregon and southeast Washington.  Design and Treatments  The eight study sites were established in 1991 and consist of six square plots 0.1 acre in  size. The plots were grouped into two blocks of three plots based on tree and site similarities.  The three treatments include control (C), nitrogen (N), and nitrogen plus sulphur (NS). Nitrogen  was applied in the urea form and sulphur in the ammonium sulfate form at a rate of 200 Ib/acre  (225 kglha.) and 100 lb/acre (113 kglha.), respectively for each nutrient by treatment. The  installations were located in mixed species stands. Five stands were regenerated naturally and  2  three were planted. Five of the stands were thinned 6-10 years previously; the remaining stands  were unthinned, but were spaced at the time of plantation establishment Site characteristics for  the eight conifer study sites are given in Table 1.

All live trees larger than 4.5 feet (1.35  m.) in height were tagged and measured for heights, diameters and defect at time of treatment.  Every two years diameters will be remeasured on all of the trees and ~y incidence of damage or ,.  mortality along with the probable cause will be noted. Heights will be remeasured every four  years after treatment on all trees. Tree volumes were estimated using regional species-specific  volume equations (Wykoff et a1. 1982).  One year after treatment, donnant season foliage samples were obtained from the two most  dominant species represented within each installation. Two dominant or codominant trees from  each species on each plot were selected for collection. Foliage was collected from the third whorl  from the top of each tree by climbing. Current season foliage was clipped, placed in plastic bags,  and stored in ice-cooled containers while in the field. In the laboratory , samples were oven dried  at 70 degrees centigrade for 24 hours, needles were separated from stems, and removed needles  were redried at 70 degrees centigrade for an additional 24 hours. Foliage was ground in Wiley  3  mill in preparation for chemical analysis.  Foliar nitrogen levels were determined using a standard micro-Kjeldahl procedure (Bremner  and Mulvaney 1982). Needles were digested with sulfuric acid and the digestrate was distilled  with steam. Total K was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Total S was analyzed  using a Leco sulphur analyzer.  Data Analysis  Tree foliar nutrient data was analyzed using the following analysis of variance model:  Ylj = U + F; + ~ + eijk  where  Yij = is the observation from the jth species on the ith treatment  u =the experimental mean  F; =is the fIXed effect of the ith fertilizer level (i =It2t3)  ~ = is the effect of the jth species (j = 1t2t3A)  eijk = is the experimental error  General linear contrasts of interest for the model above were obtained using the general  linear models procedure (PROe GLM) ofthe Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute Inc. 1985).  Results and Discussion  Foliar Nitrogen  The fertilization treatments were successful in getting additional nitrogen into the trees.  Uptake of nitrogen fertilizer was evident in consistently higher nitrogen levels for all species in  the N and NS treatments relative to the controls. On an average for all sites, the N treatment was  more successful in increasing the foliar nitrogen levels than the NS treatment, with the N treatment  increasing foliar nitrogen by 47% and the NS treatment increasing by 19%.  Foliar ~trogen levels and the effects of nutrient uptake were different by species. Douglas-fir  generally had higher levels than both ponderosa pine or lodgepole pine (except on installation  320 where ponderosa pine nitrogen levels were higher on the e and NS treatments). Positive  effects for foliar nitrogen were shown for all speciest but grand fir consistently had higher uptake  4  than Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine or lodgepole pine.  Foliar nitrogen concentration on the N and NS treatments were above reponed adequate  levels for all species (except on the NS treatment for Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine in  installations 320 and 317, respectively). Nitrogen concentrations thought to be adequate for  different species are given in Table 2., foliar nutrient levels below these values are considered  deficient This study found that Douglas-fir and grand fir foliar nitrogen levels increased above  deficient levels on the N and NS treatments, relative to the control treatments which were either  below or at reported adequate levels. Ponderosa pine foliar nitrogen levels were above adequate  for all treatments, including the control, and increased significantly on both the N and NS  treatments. Foliar nitrogen concentrations for lodgepole pine were deficient on the control  treatments but increased above adequate levels on the N and NS treatments (except on the NS  treatment in installation 317).

On an average for all sites, grand fIr foliar sulphur levels increased by 27% (P&lt; 0.05 on  installations 314, 315 and 316) and Douglas-fIr by 9% (P~ 0.05 on installation 318), while  ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine showed no significant effects. Furthennore, Douglas-fIr and  7  grand fir foliar sulphur concentration levels for all treattnents were higher than both ponderosa pine  and lodgepole pine (except on installation 313 where grand fir was lower than lodgepole pine on  the N treatment).  Foliar sulphur levels observed in this study appear to be deficient for all the species. In  addition, subsequent treatment with sulphur did not increase foliar concentrations above adequate  levels. This could be due to nutritional imbalances, where the addition of nitrogen to sulphur poor  sites could antagonize sulphur nutrient balances. Studies that have worked with sulphur and  sulphur to nitrogen ratio suggest that foliar sulphur deficiencies may be diluted or masked due to  nitrogen imbalances or additions after fertilization (Turner et al. 1977, Jarrel and Beverly, 1981).  However, significant increases in foliar sulphur concentrations were observed for Douglas-fir  (installation 318) and grand fir (installations 314, 315 and 316).  Foliar Potassium  Differences in foliar potassium concentrations were expressed among the treatments. When  nitrogen was applied alone foliar potassium levels tend to decrease. These results appear to be  similar to other studies conducted by the Intennountain Forest Tree ~utrition Cooperative (Mika  and Moore 1990), where the addition of nitrogen resulted in a decrease in potassium and a  imbalance of nitrogen to potassium. On a average for all sites, when nitrogen alone is applied,  potassium concentrations decreased by 19% for Douglas-fir (P~ 0.05 on installations 314 and 320),  13% for ponderosa pine and 31% for lodgepole pine. Grand fir potassium levels decreased by 5%  on installation 313, 2% on 314 and increased by 45% (P ~ 0.05) on installations 315 and 316.  There was no strong evidence that the NS treatment had an effect on the foliar potassium levels  across all sites and species. The average potassium levels and differences among treatments by  species for the study sites (contrasts between means) are given in Table 5.  8  Table 5.

Foliar potassium levels on all sites and for all treatments were above reported adequate  levels for Douglas-fir, grand fir and ponderosa pine. However, the addition of nitrogen did alter  the foliar potassium levels for all species. This effect is due to growth dilution (Jarrel and Beverly,  1981), where potassium accumulation within the needles is smaller than the relative increased  needle growth response ofthe nitrogen treatment, resulting in a concentration reduction. Deficient  9  potassium levels did occur for lodgepole pine on the N and NS treatments for installation 317.  Table 2. contains reported potassium deficiency levels for the four study species.  Foliar Potassium to Nitrogen Ratio  The effects of nitrogen fertilization on the potassium to the nitrogen balance or ratio (KIN)  is consistent with the potassium nutrient status. The results show for all the sites (except for grand  fir in installations 315 and 316), when nitrogen is applied alone, the KIN tends to decrease. The  effects of the N treatment decreased the KIN for grand fir by 17% (P:E 0.05 on installations 313  and 314), Douglas-fir by 48% (P&lt; 0.05 on installations 314, 318, 319 and 320), ponderosa pine  by 32% (P:E, 0.05 on installations 318 and 319) and lodgepole pine by 46% (P&lt; 0.05 on installation  317). Relative trends on the NS treatment for the foliar KIN by site and between species were  inconsistent. When comparing all sites and treatments together, grand fll' had the highest KIN  level with an average of 0.86, Douglas-fir at 0.61, ponderosa pine at 0.55, and lodgepole at 0.44.  The average KIN values and differences among treatments and by species for the study sites  (contrasts between means) are given in Table 6.  The addition of nitrogen alone has caused an imbalance in the (KIN). Ingestad (1967,  1979) suggested that for several species an adequate balance or ratio of potassium to nitrogen  should be .50. The results from this study show that grand fll' KIN is extremely high on the  controls treatments. The addition of nitrogen on both the N and NS treatments seems to have  lowered the KIN closer to reported grand fir adequate values. A decline was also observed for  Douglas-fll', ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine, especially on the N alone treatments where the  KIN significantly declined to values below the .50 reported adequate value for these species.  10  Table 6.

Conclusions  Results from this study have found that nitrogen, sulphur and potassium foliar nutrient  levels and uptake vary substantially between species and treatments. Significant foliar nutrient  11  differences occurred between species with grand fir being the most successful in increasing foliar  nutrient levels and lodgepole pine the least. Furthermore, both grand fir and Douglas-fir showed  higher nutrient concentration levels than either ponderosa pine or lodgepole pine. Although the  success of fertilization was evident by increased foliar concentration for each treatment, the overall  treatment effect did not increase nutritional values above adequate levels for all the study species.  For instance, deficient nitrogen, sulphur and potassium levels were reported for lodgepole pine  even after fertilization. In fact, the addition of nitrogen altered relative sulphur and potassium  nutrient levels. This was the circumstance for sulphur, where deficiencies were reported for all  species on all sites even after treatment with sulphur. In addition, relative potassium levels  decreased after nitrogen fertilization. Growth dilution effects and nutrient imbalances appear to  be involved. The results from this study indicate that fertilization generally significantly altered  the nutrient budget on these sites.  12  Literature Cited  Boyer, P.D. 1978. Unpub. Bend Nursery Soil Mgmt.

Root Chemistry of Douglas-fir Seedlings Grown Under Different Nitrogen and Potassium Treatments,"Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.; Marshall, J.D.","Chemical changes in roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. g/auca (Bessn.) Franco) seedlings were induced under optimal and deficient levels of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K). Concentrations of sugar, starch, phenolics and proteinprecipitable tannins were significantly different by treatment in the roots of four-year-old Douglas-fir seedlings under varied Nand K regimes. Root tip starch concentrations were significantly higher and sugar concentrations were lower in plants receiving the low-N treatments. Seedlings receiving the high N-low K treatment had significantly lower concentrations of phenolics and tannins and lower ratios of defensive compounds to carbohydrates than seedlings receiving the high potassium treatments. Samples taken from two locations on the root system show that concentrations of all storage and  defensive compounds were substantially higher in the root collar than in the root tips. Due to lower within tissue variation, we recommend sampling at root tips to better detect treatment differences. This study shows that N levels affect starch concentrations in the roots, while K levels affect root phenolic and tannin concentrations.",1998-04-01,yes,research (document genres); roots (plant components); fertilizer; statistics;,"Shaw, T.M., J.A.

Progress Report: Forest Fertilization Effects on the Understory Community,"Vanderschaaf, C.","Most forest soils in the Intermountain  Northwest have nutrient deficiencies  of some kind, especially nitrogen. Overstory conifer trees respond favorably  following fertilization in the Intermountain  Northwest.  However, knowledge of fertilization  effects on understory vegetation growth in mixed-conifer  stands in the Intermountain  Northwest is minimal.  The effects of overstory density on understory vegetation response to fertilization in the Intermountain Northwest is also limited. Information about whether fertilization  of understory vegetation causes species composition. species diversity, and wildlife habitat to change through time in mixed-conifer stands in the Intermountain  Northwest is scarce. Knowledge of the long term effects of fertilization  treatments on understory vegetation characteristics in the Intermountain Northwest is lacking. Fertilization may not produce statistically significant responses in understory vegetation growth until several years after application. This study is an attempt to quantify affects a short time after application and to establish monitoring plots. The IFTNC plans to use these study areas for a long-term assessment.

Moore  Foliar Nutrient and Two-Year Basal Area Response  on the Round Mountain Multi-Nutrient Fertilization Test Site  in Northeast Oregon  2  SUMMARY  Multi-nutrient fertilization was successful in increasing nitrogen, potassium,  sulfur and boron nutrient content in the ponderosa pine foliage. However, only nitrogen  and potassium expressed concentrations above reported critical levels, while sulfur and  boron foliar levels were deficient. On average, two-year basal area growth was 9.8%  higher on the multi-nutrient treatment than on the control.  STUDY AREA  The study area is located in the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon. The site  was established with ponderosa pine stock in the early 1960’s and pre-commercially  thinned in the 1980’s. Site characteristics include grand fir climax vegetation type and  shallow silt-loam soils overlaying Columbia River basalt parent material. The stand is  starting to experience mortality due to Armillaria root rot incidence. There is concern  that the root rot may reduce stocking below acceptable levels.  OBJECTIVE  The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effects of multiple  nutrient fertilizer application on improving plantation health and productivity.  METHODS  Plot Establishment  The study area was established in September, 1996 and consist of six square 0.1  acre plots. The plots are grouped into two areas of three plots based on treatment type,  fertilized or unfertilized. Plots were established to be as similar as possible based on tree  and site characteristics. Plots were monumented with yellow painted PVC tubing  installed at plot corners and plot center. A red forest fertilization study sign is attached to  the plot center stake. Plot trees are monumented with a yellow number and paint line at  breast height. Trees too small for suitable paint identification were tagged with an  3  aluminum tag at the base of the tree. Forest fertilization study signs are nailed along  adjacent road to identify the stand as a study area.  Treatments  The two treatments are a control and a multi-nutrient mix consisting of 100 lbs/ac.  nitrogen (N), 100 lbs/ac. potassium (K), 20 lbs/ac. sulfur (S) and 5 lbs/ac. boron (B).  Ammonium sulfate, murate of potash and agricultural grade borax were the fertilizer  forms. The multi-nutrient fertilizer treatment was commercially applied with hand  spreaders (belly bouncers) over approximately 73 acres, excluding the control plot areas.  Measurements  Initial measurements were made in the fall of 1996. All live trees taller than 4.5  feet in height were measured for heights, diameters and defect at the time of treatment.  Every two years diameters are remeasured on all of the trees and any incidence of  damage or mortality along with probable cause will be noted. Heights will be re-measured  every four years after treatment on all trees. Tree volumes are estimated using  regional species-specific volume equations (Wykoff et al. 1982). Site characteristics and  plot summaries are given in Appendix A.  One year after treatment, dormant season foliage samples were obtained from the  most dominant species represented within the installation. Two dominant or codominant  trees on each plot were selected for collection. Foliage was collected from the third  whorl from the top of each tree by climbing. Foliage was brought in from the field and  processed for nutrient chemical analysis. Foliar N concentrations were determined using  standard micro-Kjeldahl procedure while all other nutrients were determined by ICP  emission. Foliar nutrient contents were calculated for all nutrients present in the fertilizer  mix (N, K, S and B) by using this formula: nutrient concentration x weight of thirty  needles.  4  Data Analysis  General linear contrasts and differences between means by treatment for the basal  area growth and foliar nutrient responses were determined by using the least-squares  routine of the general linear models procedure (PROC GLM) of the Statistical Analysis  System (SAS Institute Inc. 1985).  Net and gross basal area growth was calculated using these formulas:  Net Basal Area Growth = BA2 – BA0  Gross Basal Area Growth = (BA2+MBA2)-BA0  where: BA0 = Basal Area (initial)  BA2 = Basal Area (2-year)  MBA2 = Mortality Basal Area (2-year)  Contrasts between basal area means are considered average growth responses to  the treatments. Combined installation growth responses are smoothed estimates which  are adjusted to a common basal area of 119 ft2/acre. Response for this study is defined as  the growth difference between the control plots and the multi-nutrient treated plots.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Foliar Response  Needles collected from the upper crown were significantly larger on those trees  receiving the multi-nutrient treatment over that of trees receiving no fertilizer treatment  (Table 1). On average, needles on trees receiving the multi-nutrient treatment weighed  32% more than those from unfertilized trees (Table 1).  Table 1.

Foliar nutrient contents in Table 2, expressed as nutrient  concentrations x needle weight, show that the multi-nutrient fertilization treatment  increased “target nutrients” (nutrients used in the fertilizer mix) in the ponderosa pine  foliage. Nutrient content expresses foliar nutrient levels relative to weight (g./30  needles), therefore eliminating possible growth nutrient dilution. Potassium showed the  highest response with a significant 69% increase in those plots receiving the fertilizer  treatment over that of the unfertilized plots. Nitrogen also showed high, although only  marginally significant (p = 0.11), foliar response on the fertilized plots with a 60%  increase over that of the unfertilized plots (Table 2). Sulfur response was also  significantly higher on the fertilized plots with a 39% increase over that of control plots.  Boron fertilization increased foliar content a non-significant 21% over that of the control  plots (Table 2).  Table 2.

Foliar nutrient concentrations and foliar nutrient content responses were similar  for N and K but not for S and B. Foliar K concentrations were a significant 27% higher  on those plots receiving the fertilizer treatment than those plots that did not receive any  fertilizer amendment (Table 3). Nitrogen also showed a response, although not  significant (p&lt; 0.10), with concentrations 20% higher on fertilized plots than on the  control plots. In contrast to S and B foliar nutrient contents, where both nutrients  expressed positive foliar response, multi-nutrient S and B concentrations were either  6  similar or lower than plots receiving no fertilizer treatment (Table 3). This in part may  have been due to large needle expansion and the dilution of S and B concentrations in the  foliage. Furthermore, S to N ratios were 17% lower on the fertilized plots than the  unfertilized plots (Table 3), which may indicate that the S fertilization rates (@ 20 lb/ac.,  prescribed is 90 lb/ac.) were too low and especially so with N fertilization. According to  Ingestad (1979) S to N ratios for optimal growth should be 0.09 (N to S = 0.15, Blake  1990). Sulfur to N ratios on the fertilized plots were 0.05 and 0.06 on the control plots  (Table 3), indicating S to N imbalances. The K to N ratio on the fertilized plots was 0.70  (above Ingestad’s 0.65 optimal recommendation for K) and 8% higher than those plots  receiving no fertilizer (Table 3).  Table 3.

Figures 1a-1d show ponderosa pine foliar nutrient concentrations and critical  levels (Turner and Lambert 1978, Powers 1983, Powers et al. 1985, Blake et al. 1990) for  the four “target nutrients” used in the fertilizer treatment. Foliar ponderosa pine nutrient  concentration levels below these critical values are considered deficient for adequate  growth. Figures 1a and 1b show N and K concentrations on both the control and multi-nutrient  treatments are above the recommended critical level. However, foliar S  7  Figure 1.

Moreover, even though nutrient contents did show S  response (Table 2), these results show that the S fertilizer amendment was not sufficient  enough to successfully increase foliar S above recommended critical values (Figure 1c).  The same conclusions can be made about B foliar concentration shown in figure 1d.  Boron concentrations were slightly above the critical value on the control but below the  critical value on the multi-nutrient treatment. Apparently, boron concentrations on the  multi-nutrient treatment experienced growth dilution effects. Phosphorus and copper  showed significantly higher concentrations on plots receiving the fertilizer treatment than  those plots receiving no fertilizer treatment (Table 3). Foliar nutrient concentrations,  other than the “target nutrients” in the fertilizer mix, are not considered deficient for  either the control or fertilized plots.  0  0.3  0.6  0.9  1.2  1.5  Control Multi  Treatments  Nitrogen (%)  Critical Level  0  5  10  15  20  25  Control Multi  Treatments  Boron (ppm)  Critical Level  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  Control Multi  Treatments  Potassium (%)  *  * p &lt; .10  Critical Level  0  0.02  0.04  0.06  0.08  0.1  Control Multi  Treatments  Sulfur (%)  Critical Level  a. b.  c.  d.  8  Basal Area Growth Response  Adjusted 2-year basal area response was not significant for either net or gross  basal area. Due to mortality on the unfertilized plots, net basal area response (1.2 sq.  ft./ac.) was slightly higher than gross basal area response (1.1 sq. ft./ac.). Net basal area  response was 9.8% higher on the multi-nutrient treatment than that of the controls (Table  4). In comparison to N and S fertilization test sites established in northeastern Oregon in  1991 (Shaw and Moore 1995), where basal area response was 17%, response for this site  was some what low at 9.8%. However, the test sites established in 1991 had 200#/ac. N  fertilization rates or twice the amount applied for this study. IFTNC response data shows  a nearly linear relationship with N application rates and growth response. Additional N  probably would have increased growth response. In addition, N and/or S response on the  1991 sites were variable by region. Some 1991 sites did not respond as well as other with  the addition of sulfur to the fertilizer mix. In addition, the 1991 N and S fertilization sites  had species compositions that were only partially ponderosa pine which showed low  response to the fertilizer treatment.  Table 4.

However, multi-nutrient S and B concentration  9  levels were below standard deficiency levels reported for ponderosa pine. This result was  due to initially low S and B nutrient levels and large needle expansion (growth) caused  by N fertilization. Higher S application rate could have increased S foliar concentration  to acceptable levels.  Although it is difficult to draw strong conclusions from one site, results from this  study are similar and reasonable when compared to other fertilization study sites in this  region.  10  References  Blake, J.I., H.N.

Treating container-grown stock with controlled release fertilizers to improve  seedling nutrient status and stimulate field growth has recently become a topic of great  interest (Donald 1991). In the nursery, controlled release fertilizers have been applied either  into the growing medium (Brockley 1988) or as top dressing (Hunt 1989, Walker and Huntt  1992, Walker and Kane 1997). Walker and Huntt (1992) reported controlled release  fertilizer were more effective for producing container-grown Jeffrey pine seedlings than  water-soluble fertilizers. However, nursery and outplanting performance greatly depends on  fertilizer nutrient release characteristics and application rates (Brockley 1988). However,  extensive greenhouse and field tests are still needed to develop effective fertilization  regimes particularly good release and application rate combinations. The primary objective  of this study was to evaluate the effect of three controlled release fertilizers incorporated in  the root plug at three levels on biomass allocation of ponderosa pine seedlings after two  growing seasons in the field.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Site description  The experiment was located in Latah county in northern Idaho at 46° 51' Nand 116°50'  W., elevation 950 m. The Vassar Silt Loam soil at the site is 1.5 m deep. The habitat type is  Abies grandis/Clilonia unif/ora (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968). A maritime climate  moderates the extremes in temperature often associated with the Northern Rocky Mountains.  In winter. the average temperature is 0 °C, and the average daily minimum temperature is -4  4  °C. In summer, the average temperature is 17 °C, and the average daily maximum  temperature is 27 °C. Located just out of the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains, the  summers begin moist and gradually turn dry by mid-July and continue mostly without  appreciable rain through mid-September. October has an increasing chance ofrainfall. As  autumn progresses into winter, the precipitation increases dramatically falling as either snow  or rain. The total annual precipitation is 763 mm. Of this, 267 mm, or 35 percent, usually  falls in April through September (Osborne and Appelgren 1996). The study site was  clearcut in 1995 and the slash burned in the spring of 1996.  Experimental design and treatments  A randomized complete block design was used with six blocks per treatment on the one­acre  experimental site. In each block, thirty-six ponderosa pine seedlings from each  treatment were assigned randomly to a square plot ofsize 8*8 m with trees planted at 1.3 by  1.3 m spacing. All ponderosa pine seedlings planted for this study were raised the previous  year (1996) at the University ofIdaho Forest Research Nursery. Seedlings were stored at 0.5  °C, with relative humidity near 100 percent for 5 months (from December of the previous  year to April) before planting. The three types of controlled-release fertilizers (Table 1): fast  release (FR, release period approximately 9 months), moderate release (MR, release period  approximately 12-14 months) and slow release (SR, release period approximately 16-20  months) were applied into the planting medium at sowing at 0.8, 1.6 and 3.6 grams per cell  (seedling). The containers used for growing ponderosa pine seedlings were 160/90 (160  cavities per block, 90 cm3 per cavity). All seedlings were planted between April 20lh and  22011  , 1997.  5  Biomass harvest and soil nutrient analysis  A random sample of 12 seedlings (two seedlings per plot) was selected for each  treatment. The seedlings' root systems were excavated from the soil in a 60- cm radius circle  around the stem to 60-cm depth on May 7, 1999 when the soil was moist. Seedling roots  were hand washed, and diameter at the root collar and height from the root collar to the base  of the dominant bud was measured. Each seedling was cut at the root collar and separated  into root, stem and foliage components. The root, stem and foliage samples were separately  oven dried at 700 C for 72 hours and then weighed. Foliage weight ratio (FWR), stem  weight ratio (SWR) and root weight ratio (RWR) were calculated as the ratio of the foliage,  stem and root weights, respectively, to total seedling dry weight. Shoot/root ratio was  calculated as the ratio of shoots' dry weight (foliage + stem) to roots.  Data analysis  Dunnett's multiple comparison test (Kirk 1995) was conducted to detect differences in  average total dry weight, foliage, stcm and root dry weight, and foliage, stem and root dry  weight ratios, and shoot/root ratios for the nine fertilization treatments and the control.  Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOYA) and two-way classification analysis of  variance (ANOVA) were conducted on foliage, stem, root dry weight, and foliage, stem and  root weight ratio, shoot/root ratio and total biomass data, respectively, to estimate the effects  of the three different release rate fertilizers and the three application rates on biomass  allocation of ponderosa pine seedlings. Simple linear regression was performed to  quantitatively describe relationships between calipcr, height, foliage, stem, root and total  biomass of ponderosa pine seedlings grown under different treatments. All statistical  computations were conducted using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure ofSAS  (SAS,1lJ Institute Inc. 1995).  RESULTS  Total and component biomass and biomass ratios  Compared with the controls (no controlled-release fertilizer incorporated in the root  plug), some fertilization treatments resulted in significantly (p=0.05) larger foliage, stem,  root and total dry weight of ponderosa pine seedlings (Figure 1). Both fertilizer source  (release characteristics and nutrient composition) and application rate contributed to the  significant biomass increase. Two treatments, the 1.6 or 3.2 grams ofMR fertilizer in the  root plug significantly increased seedling foliage dry weight. Three treatments, the 1.6  grams of FR, MR or SR fertilizers resulted in significantly larger stem dry weight. Seven  treatments produced significant root dry weight increase, as follows: all rates of FR  fertilizer, 1.6 or 3.2 grams ofMR fertilizer, and 0.8 or 3.2 grams ofSR fertilizer. The  significant increase in seedling total dry weight resulted from four fertilization treatments:  1.6 grams ofFR, MR or SR fertilizer and 3.2 grams ofMR fertilizer.  MANOYA showed that there was no significant difference in foliage, stem and root dry  weights between fertilizer sources (Wilks' Lambda = 0.8547), application rates (Wilks'  Lambda = 0.3845) and the interactions of fertilizer source by application rate (Wilks'  Lambda=0.6978).  In contrast to absolute dry weights, ratios of foliage, stem and root weights were not  affected by fertilization. No significant differences in foliage, stem or root weight ratios or  6  7  root/shoot ratios were found between fertilization treatments and the control.The fertilization  treatments and the control biomass ratios were nearly identical (Figure 2).  Caliper and height response  Neither fertilizer source nor the interaction of fertilizer source and application rate had  an effect on caliper and height growth. Caliper growth was marginally affected only by  application rate (p=0.0362). Seedling caliper grew faster when 1.6 grams ofcontrolled  release fertilizer was incorporated in the container compared to either the 0.8 or 3.2 grams  application rates. No difference in caliper was found between 0.8 and 3.2 grams application  rates. Heights were not significantly different for the three application rates at the end of the  second growing season. The relationship between final caliper and height was significantly  affected by application rates (p&lt;O.OOI) (Figure 3) as described by equations (1), (2) and (3).  Control: Height = -10.25 + 3.20 Caliper R2 =0.66 P&gt;F=0.0008 (1)  (12.02) (0.69)  0.8 and 3.2 g: Height = 12.61 +1.93 Caliper R2 =0.66 P&gt;F=O.OOOI (2)  (5.06) (0.24)  1.6 g: Height = 33.36 + 0.96 Caliper R2 = 0.22 P&gt;F=0.0057 (3)  (7.26) (0.32)  Caliper, height, total and component biomass relationships  Regression equations are given in Table 2 relating the following components: total and  foliage dry weight, stem and root dry weight, caliper and height. Residual analysis showed a  random pattern around zero with no detectable trend. Total dry weight of ponderosa pine  seedlings was closely related to foliage, stem, and root dry weight, caliper and height.  Neither fertilizer source or application rate nor their interaction significantly affected the  relationships. Based on the R-square values for all equations, foliage weight was best  correlated with total seedling dry weight (R2 =0.962, Figure 4), and the next highest  correlation was foliage with stem weight. Caliper alone accounts for 85.3 % of variation in  total dry weight, while height only interprets 58.2% of variation in total dry weight. In  addition, caliper was also more closely related to foliage, stem and root dry weight than was  height (Table 2).  8  DISCUSSION  Fertilization increased foliage, stem, root and total biomass, but did not change foliage,  stem and root weight ratios nor shoot/root ratios. This result agrees with studies on western  hemlock (Tsuga helerophylla) (Carlson 1981) and on Douglas-fir (Pseudolsuga menziesii)  (Carlson and Preisig 1981), but differed from studies on Douglas-fir (Keyes and Grier 1981;  Grier et al. 1984; Vogt et al. 1985; Grier et al. 1986) and on paper birch (Betula papyrifera)  (Wang et al. 1997). The change in proportion (allometric relationships) of various parts of a  tree depends on both biotic (species, genotype, size) and abiotic (water and nutrient  availability) factors (Caison 1981; Gower et al. 1987; Wang et al. 1997). The allometric  relationships are predominantly determined by abiotic factors such as soil moisture and  nutrient availability for a specific tree species or genotype of the same age or growth phase.  Based on studies of lowland Douglas-fir forests, Grier et al. (1986) proposed a conceptual  model to illustrate the effects of water and mineral nutrient availability on Douglas-fir  productivity and carbon allocation patterns. Soil moisture and mineral nutrients influence  productivity directly through its effects on leaf area (biomass) and/or on the photosynthetic  efficiency ofthe leaf area. This concept was supported by our study since fertilized  9  seedlings had greater foliage biomass than unfertilized seedlings, and our unpublished data  that shows photosynthesis rates offertilized seedlings were higher than those of unfertilized  seedlings. Trees invest less to belowground biomass with increasing soil nutrient and water  availability (Berntson et al. 1995). Tree biomass allocation in response to fertilization  appears to be related to the degree of nutrient (such as nitrogen) limitation prior to  fertilization (Grier et al. 1986). Since we fertilized the seedlings in the greenhouse, the  treatments did not affect soil properties at the planting site (Fan 1999). Although the  treatments caused different root/shoot ratios at the time of planting, after two field growing  seasons the seedlings adjusted carbon allocation such that the only fertilizer effect was on  seedling size. Significant differences in foliage, stem, root and total dry weights between  fertilized and unfertilized seedlings were due to greater foliage biomass and higher nutrient  concentrations of fertilized seedlings compared to the unfertilized seedlings. This suggests  that productivity is more directly related to foliage biomass and foliar nutrient status, while  shoot/root ratio is more directly related to soil nutrient availability. In our study, fertilized  ponderosa pine seedlings had larger root systems (increased number and diameter of lateral  roots) than unfertilized seedlings, but there were no differences in root symmetry between  fertilized and unfertilized seedlings nor between the various fertilizer treatments.  Seedling height/caliper relationships were changed by fertilization in our study. For  small diameters «20mm), fertilized seedlings were taller than unfertilized seedlings of the  same diameter; however, for large diameters, unfertilized seedlings were taller than  fertilized seedlings of the same diameter (Figure 3). This means that within the diameter  range, fertilized seedlings were more uniform (less variation) in height compared to  unfertilized seedlings; and conversely, within a specific height range, fertilized seedlings  10  had more variation in caliper than unfertilized seedlings. The differences in the intercepts  and slopes of regression equations between fertilized and unfertilized seedlings suggest that  fertilization can be used to change shoot morphology. Burdett et al. (1984) reported a sharp  drop in height/diameter ratios of planted spruce (Picea mariana) during the observation  period. The decrease in height/diameter ratios with increasing tree size is a survival strategy  that is also affected by environmental conditions such as soil moisture and nutrient  availability (as in our study) and light intensity (Naidu et al. 1998). The pipe model theory  of plant form suggests that tree foliage biomass is proportional to stem cross-sectional area  at live crown base but not so for height (Shinozaki et a1. 1964a, 1964b; Waring et a1. 1982).  For seedlings or young trees, foliage biomass is proportional to stcm diameter (or cross­sectional  area) at the root collar. In our study the coefficient of determination for the  regression of foliage biomass versus diameter at the root collar was as high as 0.96. A direct  consequence of significant increases in foliage and total biomass was the increase in  diameter at the root collar more so than height. The coefficient of determination for the  foliage biomass versus height regression was 0.53, much lower than for thc regression of  foliage biomass versus root collar diameter. As expected, fertilized seedlings had lower  height/diameter ratios than unfertilized seedlings.  Many morphological measurements such as caliper, height and height/caliper ratio have  been used to predict seedling performance after planting (Donald 1991). Generally, caliper  is a better predictor of performance than hcight, partly because it is more closely related to  root size than is height. Our study validated this point, since caliper was more strongly  correlated with foliage, stem, root and total biomass than was height (Table 3).  Height/caliper ratio can also be used along with caliper for predicting seedling performance.  11  In our study, the strong association between caliper and total and component biomass of  ponderosa pine seedlings (Table 2) suggests that caliper may be used to estimate above- and  below-ground biomass and to index stand productivity.  CONCLUSIONS  Fertilizers placed in the container at the time of sowing increased foliage, stem, root and  total biomass of ponderosa pine seedlings from 80 to 120% compared to unfertilized  seedlings, but did not change foliage, stem, root dry weight ratios and shoot/root ratios. The  significant increase in foliage, stem, root and total biomass was attributable to larger foliage  biomass and higher foliar nutrient concentrations prior to planting; while the non-significant  change in foliage, stem, root dry weight ratios and shoot/root ratios was predominantly duc  to the same soil nutrient status for both fertilized and unfcrtilized plots at the planting site.  Moderate release fcrtilizer appears to be bettcr than FR fertilizer for increasing biomass  production that was in turn bctter than SR fertilizer, and 1.6 grams per seedling was superior  to 3.2 grams per seedling and to 0.8 grams per seedling. Fertilization altered height/diameter  ratios of ponderosa pine seedlings as follows; for small calipers «20mm), fertilized  seedlings were taller than unfertilized seedlings of the same diameter; however, for large  diameters, unfertilized seedlings were taller than fertilized seedlings of the same diameter.  Overall, fertilized seedlings had lower height/diameter ratios than did unfertilized seedlings.  The strong association between caliper and total and component biomass of ponderosa pinc  scedlings suggests that simply measuring caliper is a reliable (and less timc-consuming)  method for assessing treatment effect in future biomass allocation and productivity studies.  12  Acknowledgments:  The authors thank the Scotts Company and members of the Intermountain Forest Tree  Nutrition Cooperative for supporting the project.

Analysis of variance showed significant differences  between laboratories for the same sample tissue. In addition, even though all three  laboratories use ICP instrumentation, protocol techniques for preparing the foliage  samples for analysis differ between laboratories. Various standards and internal checks  are used routinely by each laboratory. It appears that the techniques used to digest and  prepare the foliage samples are the main sources of variation between laboratories.  Introduction  Comparisons were performed between three independent laboratories that the  IFTNC and a number of organizations frequently use in determining nutrient  concentrations in conifer foliage. Our analysis was performed to assist the IFTNC and its  members in selecting a laboratory for future foliar nutrient analysis. We compared  results from the following laboratories: Scotts Company, Allentown, PA.; Harris  Laboratories, Lincoln, NE.; and University of Idaho Analytical Science Laboratory,  Moscow, ID. Specific objectives are to determine the variation between and within  laboratories using the same conifer foliar samples sent to different laboratories and  duplicates of the same samples analyzed twice by the same laboratory. The laboratories  were not aware which samples were duplicates. Due to limitation in the data set not all  comparisons could be explored. Therefore, determinations are based on the best  statistical analysis permitted by the data and the interpretations of the IFTNC staff.  Results and Discussion  All three laboratories use a form of inductively coupled plasma emission  spectrometry (ICP or ICAP) in determining macro and micro nutrient concentrations,  excluding nitrogen. There are three main steps in the ICP analysis. Ground and dried  samples are either ashed or chemically digested then digested with heat and chemicals’  and finally analyzed using ICP spectrometry. Table 1 summarizes each laboratory’s  protocol for the ICP process is summarized in Table 1.  As part of each laboratory’s methods and procedures, standards and duplicates are  analyzed periodically to calibrate the analytical instruments and check accuracy and  precision. All three laboratories use National Bureau of Standard (NBS) plant material  samples to test and calibrate methods and analytical instruments. NBS plant materials are  certified as to their elemental content. Types of standard materials used by the  laboratories in our comparison vary. All three laboratories use a series of elemental and  plant standards to ensure optimal operation, some which may be specific to various  sample matrices. Our laboratories commonly use pine, peach and spinach tissue for plant  material standards. In addition to NBS standards, internal duplicates are used. All three  laboratories run standards and/or internal checks every 10 to 15 samples being analyzed  (Table 1).  Table 1. ICP protocol procedures for the Harris, Scotts and U of I laboratories.

Check  Standards/Samples  Every 10-15  samples Every 15 samples  Every 10-15  Samples  ICP is a common technique for examining foliar chemical levels and is used by all  three laboratories in this comparison. In addition, all three laboratories calibrate their  ICP apparatus through a series of check standards and duplication techniques. As part of  the ICP preparation process, digestion of plant material is needed to achieve a medium  that is suitable for spectrometry analysis. There are three main components in this  process, amount and type of chemical, heating temperatures and digestion duration time.  The preparation process varies between the three laboratories (Table 1). For example,  Scotts protocol uses high temperatures to initially break down the plant material  (otherwise known as dry ashing) followed by chemical digestion, while Harris and U of I  use lower heating temperatures and a series of chemical digestions (wet ash).  Furthermore, Scotts ICP instrument is a Thermo Jerell while Harris and U of I use a  Perkin-Elmer ICP instrument. Even though Harris and U of I protocols are more similar  than Scotts, chemicals, temperatures and digestion duration times do differ between these  two (Table 1). Moreover, Harris’s laboratory protocol includes additional chemical  digestion and buffers that are not present in U of I methods (Table 1).  The analysis of variance comparisons between Harris versus U of I laboratories  and Harris versus Scotts laboratories, respectively are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Foliar  nutrient comparisons were made using common samples for each laboratory pairing.  Comparisons used for this analysis were chosen solely based on availability of IFTNC  sample materials. Overall, agreement was much better between Harris and U of I  compared to Harris versus Scotts laboratories for foliar nutrient concentrations (Tables 2  and 3). Analysis of variance parameters and estimates in Tables 2 and 3 generally show  higher R2 values and lower coefficients of variation (CV) for the Harris versus U of I  regression compared the Harris versus Scotts results. There is stronger agreement  between Harris and U of I laboratory results than there is between Harris and Scotts.  However, several nutrient comparisons differed significantly for both laboratory  comparisons. Calcium, iron and copper showed low R2 values and high CV’s for both  laboratory comparisons (Tables 2 and 3). Since both comparisons show high variation  for these nutrients and Harris laboratory was included in both comparisons, one may  conclude that Harris’s estimates for these nutrients are inaccurate. However, we need  additional analyses beyond the extent of our data, to fully explore this conclusion.  Table 2.

Conclusions and Recommendations  Analysis of variance regression has shown that variation between laboratory  results can be significantly high even though all three laboratories are reporting their  results after using ICP instrumentation. Moreover, NBS standards and internal checks  are used extensively by all three laboratories to insure optimal operation and reduce  variation, but still differences occur within and between laboratory results. It appears that  much of the variation stems from methods used in preparing the samples before ICP  analysis. Digestion chemicals, heating temperatures and heating duration vary by  laboratory. It would follow that different preparation techniques would result in different  nutrient extraction levels and ICP results.  The IFTNC believes that all three laboratories are reputable and present results in  as accurate and precise manner as possible for the protocol techniques used. However,  our analysis shows that Harris and U of I results correlate more strongly than do Harris  and Scotts. Therefore, based on statistical comparisons of the laboratories and Harris’s  ability to replicate within laboratory samples, we recommend that Harris be used as our  primary contractor for foliar analysis, with a precautionary note that Harris’s copper and  iron results be accepted with some level of scrutiny and skepticism.",North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,,,2016-08-12,2016-08-12,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/908,908,909.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/909.pdf,forestryresearch908

Shaw and James A. Moore  April, 1999  OVERVIEW  Vector analysis is a foliar graphical technique used to compare plant growth, nutrient  concentrations and nutrient content. It is a useful diagnostic tool to determine nutritional  status of trees in response to silvicultural prescriptions such as forest fertilization. Vector  analysis has been used over the past few decades to examine plant responses to various  treatments. More recently, the IFTNC has used foliar vector analysis to interpret  experimental forest nutrient status and tree growth response.  IFTNC staff, graduate students, and associates developed Vector Excell. Vector Excell  was written within Microsoft Excel® Visual Basic Editor and runs in a PC (IBM®  compatible) environment.  This paper covers Vector Excell installation, data entry and operation. Foliar data  collection and foliar vector interpretation is the responsibility of the user and not the  IFTNC, although the IFTNC can serve as advisees on these matters. Appendices A, B  and C contain foliage collection and vector interpretation materials and vector analysis  references, respectively.  INSTALLATION  Vector Excell is a simple software program used as a Microsoft Excel® application.  Versions older than Microsoft Excel® 97 may not be capable of running Vector Excell.  The Vector Excell program is contained within one file labeled vexcell.xls and is on the  3.5” floppy provided. Vector Excell will run from floppy or hard drive applications,  however, Vector Excell will run faster and more efficiently if loaded on the hard drive.  Vector Excell does not have installation or load “exe” files but is simply run from the  vexcell.xls file as a Microsoft Excel® application.  LANUNCHING VECTOR EXCELL  From your PC click on the Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet package. Once in Microsoft  Excel® the user must activate the Analysis ToolPak, which can be done by first selecting  the Tools option. Next select the Add-Ins option and finally the ToolPak option. ToolPak  settings need only be initiated once per PC. Vector Excell will not run without the  ToolPak option being initiated. Vector Excell is initiated by bringing the vexcell.xls  file into the Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet through the File/Open option. Once the file  has been selected Vector Excell will immediately present a Microsoft Excel® Macro  menu. Click the “Enable Macros” button to initiate the Vector Excell spreadsheet. Once  the “Enable Macros” has been initiated, Vector Excell spreadsheet should appear (Note:  you may need to scroll the screen up to view properly). An example of the Vector Excell  spreadsheet is shown in Table 1.  FOLIAR ANALYSIS  The basis for interpretation of foliar analysis lies in the relationship between foliar  nutrient concentrations and growth. Any effects of nutrient treatments will be shown  through nutrient concentrations and foliar dry weights. Foliar concentrations and foliar  weights by treatment are the only two variables needed to be entered in Vector Excell.  Guidelines for conifer foliar collection, weighing and drying techniques are given in  Appendix A. Concentration of the nutrients of interest should be determined by standard  laboratory techniques for each treatment.  DATA ENTRY  There are 7 columns in the Vector Excell spreadsheet. Column 4 and column 6 will be  used to enter foliar concentrations and dry foliar weights, respectively. Foliar  concentrations and sample dry weights are used to calculate nutrient content (column 2).  Nutrient content is calculated for each treatment by taking the product of nutrient  concentration and foliar unit dry weight. In addition, to allow comparisons between  treatments, foliar nutrient concentrations, contents and foliar weights must be normalized  relative to the control or reference treatment. These values are represented in columns 3,  5 and 7. Normalization of the data requires that each value for each treatment be divided  by the corresponding value for the control or reference treatment and then multiplied by  100. Vector Excell will automatically calculate columns 2, 3, 5 and 7 after foliar  concentrations and dry foliage weights are entered in columns 4 and 6. Vector Excell  will also generate the appropriate number of treatments by nutrient and place them into  column 1. Appendix B contains materials helpful in interpreting foliar vector analysis.  Foliar nutrient concentrations and dry foliar weights by treatment are to be entered in  columns 4 and 6. To do this, click the START AND ENTER DATA button located on  the top left corner of the Vector Excell spreadsheet. This will prompt Vector Excell at  prepare the spreadsheet for data entry. An information box will appear and Vector Excell  will ask you to enter the number of treatments. The control or reference treatment is not  to be used in determining the number of treatments. For example, if your nutrient regime  includes a nitrogen treatment, nitrogen plus potassium treatment and a control, then your  entry would be 2. After entering the number of treatments then click on “OK”. Vector  Excell will generate a table for each nutrient with the appropriate number of treatments,  including a control (column 1). An example of this spread sheet is shown in Table 2.  Foliar concentrations and sample weight data can simply be entered by typing the data in  by hand or using “cut and paste” techniques into columns 4 and 6. It is recommended the  data be entered into a spreadsheet for easier access and availability. It is important that  the nutrient concentrations and foliar weights be entered in the appropriate rows by  treatment. If nutrient data is not available or is missing, Vector Excell will automatically  fill those missing values with the number 1. Vector Excell’s graphical analysis will not  be generated for those missing nutrient values. Table 3 shows a Vector Excell  spreadsheet with foliar concentrations and dry sample weights entered.  RELATIVE NUMBER GENERATION  After data entry is completed, click on the PUSH IF DATA HAS BEEN ENTERD  button. Vector Excell will now generate relative nutrient contents and concentrations  plus relative dry weight values by nutrient and treatment. The resulting spreadsheet  should look similar to the spreadsheet in Table 1. Check the data sheet for missing  values and possible data entry errors.  GRAPHING  If the data appears accurate and complete, click on the GRAPH button. Vector Excell  will then provide a box where titles or graph headings can be typed. Click “OK” after the  title has been entered. The graphics routine in Vector Excell will generate graphical  representations of the relative nutrient concentrations and content values. Graphs will be  generated for all nine nutrients and treatments involved in the analysis, regardless if data  was entered for that nutrient. Those nutrients with entered data will appear as normal  scatter graphs while nutrients with no data will appear in groups at the origin. Relative  sample weights are not represented graphically. Figure 1 shows two vector graphs  generated by Vector Excell. The first graph represents a ordinary vector graph generated  from data provided by the user, whereas the second graph represents a graph with  missing data. The second graph has no meaning and should be disregarded.  VECTOR AND SAMPLE WEIGHT ENHANCEMENT  Vector Excell does not provide visual vector rays or diagonal weight lines useful in  interpreting vector analysis. However, it is a simple task to create these rays and lines by  using the drawing option in Microsoft Excel®. If the drawing option is not already  present in your tool bar selection, select View and then the Toolbars option. Microsoft  Excel® will provide you with a list of tool options from which drawing should be  selected. From the drawing tool bar it is simple to create or draw vector lines between  vector points through click and drag techniques. In addition, diagonal lines can be  created to represent sample weight lines.  VECTOR INTERPRETATION  The vector analysis graphical display may look complicated and confusing, however  vector analysis graphing is a simple representation of plotting relative nutrient  concentrations against relative nutrient content. Because nutrient content is a function of  concentration and weight the data will be correctly positioned among foliar weight  diagonal lines. Each point on the vector diagram represents the magnitude and  directional shift of each nutrient from the control or reference treatment. Distance from  the control represents the responsiveness of the treatment or nutrient being analyzed. It is  not the scope of this document to interpret vector analysis, however Appendix B contains  helpful vector analysis materials summarized by IFTNC staff. In addition, Appendix C  lists several good references on this topic.  SAVING DATA  Graphs and data sheets can be saved at any time after the graphing session has ended by  either going to the save option under File or attempting to close Vector Excell. Both  avenues for saving will save data and graphs in a file at an address of choice, however,  saving by choosing the close option in Vector Excell will cause the program to close after  the information is saved, whereas Vector Excell will remain open when using the save  option.  CLOSING VECTOR EXCELL  Vector Excell can be closed at any time during the operation by selecting File and Close  or clicking on the file X button located in the upper right corner. Microsoft Excell will  ask if the vexcell.xls file needs to be saved. This save option should be refused because  this may save any changes to the Vector Excell program. Instead select no and you will  be exited from Vector Excell.",North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,,,2016-08-12,2016-08-12,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/909,909,910.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/910.pdf,forestryresearch909
The Effect of Nitrogen Fertilization and Rock Type on Individual Tree Mortality,"Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.","An individual tree mortality model for nitrogen fertilized Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. gIauca (Beissn.) Franco) stands was developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the inland Northwest. The proposed linear logistic model included the following independent variables: a set of dummy variables for the 5 rock types, a set of dummy variables for the 3 nitrogen fertilizer treatments, diameter at breast height, crown ratio, number of trees per hectare, and relative rank of tree size, defined by basal area in larger trees over basal area per ha. The results show that nitrogen fertilization and rock type significantly affect individual tree mortality. Trees growing on granitic and meta-sedimentary rocks exhibited greater probabilities of mortality than did those growing on other rocks. The probabilities of mortality for trees growing on sedimentary rocks were very low. The probabilities of tree monality increased with increasing nitrogen fertilizer application rates. Finally, nitrogen fertilization response ratios for annual probability of tree mortality were estimated based on the mortality model. The response ratios were nearly constant (about 1.54) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 224 kg N treatment. The response ratios were also nearly constant (about 2.50) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 448 kg N treatment.",1999-12-01,yes,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Shen, G., C.R.

Ponderosa Pine Response to Nitrogen or Nitrogen Plus Potassium Fertilization - Annual Report,"Shaw, T.M.","In 1985, the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) established 10 nitrogen (N) fertilization trials in stands dominate by Ponderosa pine. The ponderosa pine trials were located throughout northeastern Oregon and central Washington and were an expansion of IFTNC Douglas-fir N fertilization trials established in the early 1980�s. The focus of these fertilization trials was to study nutrition of commercial forests in the Intermountain Northwest, with the majority of the effort on studying the effect of N fertilization on growth and survival. In addition, evidence from IFTNC Douglas-fir trials (Mika and Moore 1990) and other research from the Inland Northwest suggested that elements other than N, particularly potassium (K), may also be limiting. In 1987, IFTNC members established 6 additional ponderosa pine trials in Montana to study the effects of N and K fertilization on tree growth and survival.

Copyright © 2000 by the Society of American Foresters  CONCENTRATIONS OF STORAGE AND SECONDARY com-pounds  in plant tissue, such as sugars, starches,  phenols and tannins, depend to a considerable ex-tent  on the environment in which plants grow (Waring et al.  1985, Huber and Arny 1985). The concentrations of these  compounds and the balance among them help to determine  the resistance of plants to herbivores and pathogens (Wargo  1972, Garraway 1975, Ostrofsky and Shigo 1984, Larsson et  al. 1986, Mwangi et al.1990, Dudt and Shure 1994). Re-cently,  there has been increased interest in developing a  better understanding of the growing environment and bio-chemical  characteristics for forest trees (Bryant et al. 1983,  Entry et al. 1991a, Moore et al. 1994, Gebauer et al. 1998,  Penuelas and Estiarte 1998, Shaw et al. 1998). Douglas-fir  was selected for our study because it is commonly managed  in the forests of the inland Northwest of North America and  has wide ecological and geographic distributions.  Resource availability may influence production of sec-ondary  compounds like phenols and tannins (Mooney 1972,  Bazzaz et al. 1987). In our study, we wanted to ascertain the  influence of environmental factors, specifically differences  in temperature and moisture growing conditions, on the  levels of carbon-based compounds in the roots of forest-grown,  mature Douglas-fir trees. Although on-site tempera-ture  and moisture measurements were not made in our study,  we rely on the literature that suggests stands growing on a  532 Forest Science 46(4) 2000  variety of habitat types (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968,  Pfister et al. 1977) should represent a range of temperature  and moisture conditions. Furthermore, habitat classification  of forestland in the inland Northwest is common and ecologi-cal  interpretations are well developed (Cooper et al. 1991,  McDaniel et al. 1994, Neiman 1988). Implicit in our ap-proach  is the untested assumption that variation in root  chemistry due to short-term weather differences is minor  compared to long-term environmental effects reflected by  different habitat types. We believe this assumption is reason-able,  but it should be tested in future work. Thus, the principal  objective of our study was to determine differences in the  chemical composition of Douglas-fir roots among habitat  types.  Methods and Materials  Site Selection  The Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative  (IFTNC) maintains a large set of long-term Douglas-fir  nutrition field experiments (Moore et al. 1991). We selected  eight IFTNC sites for root chemistry sampling, only using  trees growing on the untreated control plots. The eight study  sites are located in northern Idaho, northeastern Oregon, and  eastern Washington, and included Douglas-fir (dry and warm  growing conditions), grand fir (Abies grandis [Doug.] Forbes)  (moderate temperature and moisture regimes), and western  redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn.) (cool and moist growing  conditions) habitat type series. Our intent was to use habitat  type series as a selection criterion to ensure a broad range of  temperature and moisture conditions for our study. Mean  annual total precipitation estimates for 31 sites in Idaho,  including 4 of the sites used in this study, varied significantly  (P = 0.0001) by habitat type, with Douglas-fir types averag-ing  80 cm, grand fir types 92 cm, and redcedar types 111 cm  of precipitation per year over a 30 yr period (IFTNC Annual  Report 1992). These data support the use of habitat type as a  way to allocate our samples across a range of environmental  conditions. Selected site and stand characteristics for the  eight study sites are provided in Table 1. All sites are  dominated by Douglas-fir, averaging 90% composition by  basal area for this species (Table 1). Elevations range from  about 700 to 1400 m; thus our study includes only low- to  mid-elevation Douglas-fir stands. Soil taxonomy differed at  each site: for example, the following soil orders were in-cluded  among the eight sites: alfisols, andisols, inceptisols,  and mollisols. The sites are divided among the three habitat  types and consequently span a wide range of site quality as  estimated by Douglas-fir site index (Table 1). All sites are  populated by local Douglas-fir seed sources naturally regen-erated  after fire or natural harvest regeneration systems.  Tree Growth and Plot Measurements  Each plot sampled in the present study was 0.04 ha in size,  and the average number of Douglas-fir sample trees per plot  was 24. All live plot trees were tagged and measured for  diameters at the beginning of the original fertilization experi-ment  in 1981 and 1982. Every 2 yr, diameters were remeasured  on all trees for a 10 yr period, and any incidence of damage  or mortality along with probable cause was noted. Basal areas  were summed over all trees, not just Douglas-fir, to obtain  plot totals. Douglas-fir site index estimates for each plot were  made based on height-age observations from stem analysis of  destructively sampled trees located near each plot (Monserud  1984, Vander Ploeg and Moore 1989).  Collecting Tree Root Samples  Two undamaged and apparently healthy dominant Dou-glas-  fir trees on the sampling plots at each of the eight study  sites were selected for root chemistry sampling. Root bark  samples of living tissues (including phloem, cambium,  phellum, and phelloderm) 6.25 cm2 in size were collected  from four main lateral roots for each tree. The soil was  carefully excavated from each root, and the samples obtained  near the root collar (~ 0.3 m from the tree bole) just under the  mineral soil surface. Shaw et al (1998) showed that root collar  samples were highly correlated with root tip samples for  phenol, tannin, sugar, and starch concentrations for young  Douglas-fir trees. Thus, we feel the root collar sampling  location used in our study is representative of the entire root  system. In addition, field sampling procedures are similar to  those of Entry et al. (1991b). Samples were collected from all  sites during fall 1993. After collection, the four root samples  were composited by tree, placed in plastic vials, quickly  frozen on dry ice, and placed in insulated containers for  transport back to the laboratory for processing. At the labo-ratory,  the samples were placed in an ultra-cold (-80°C)  freezer until they could be freeze-dried awaiting laboratory  analysis.  Quantification of Carbohydrates, Phenolics, and Tannins  in the Root Tissues  For the chemical analyses, all bark samples were put in  liquid nitrogen overnight.

Total phenols were determined from samples after  extracting with aqueous acetone (80%), adding Folin-  Ciocalteu’s Reagent and then measuring absorbances at 700  and 735 nm (Julkunen-Tiito 1985). Other subsamples were  analyzed for total soluble starch through an ethanol and  perchloric acid method (Hansen and Moller 1975), and glu-cose  was subsequently determined by adding anthrone solu-tion  for absorbance determination at 630 nm (Hansen and  Moller 1975). Glucose concentration measurements were  calibrated with a glucose standard (Hansen and Moller 1975).  The Hansen and Moller method overestimates starch levels  because carbohydrates other than starch are extracted during  the process (Marshall 1986, Rose et al. 1991). Perchlorate-extractable  carbohydrates were, therefore, corrected to yield  starch concentrations and are expressed in their corrected  form throughout this article. Tannin was determined by  extracting with 80% aqueous acetone, loading the extract into  an agarose plate containing bovine serum albumin, and  measuring diffusion rings (Hagerman 1987). The Institute of  Biological Chemistry, Washington State University, Pull-man,  WA, performed the analysis of starch, sugar (glucose),  total phenols, and protein-precipitable tannins.  Statistical Analysis  Analysis of variance (PROC GLM) was first used to test  for differences between means by habitat type series for root  chemistry data using the least-squares means procedure of  the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute Inc. 1985).  Subsequently, correlations between the various root chemi-cal  constituents and several measures of stand growth rate, as  well as age, were analyzed to better explain some of the  ANOVA results.  Results  The results of the Douglas-fir root chemical analyses,  expressed as mean root concentrations and concentration  ratios for the three habitat type series, are shown in Figure 1.  Trees growing on Douglas-fir habitat types had an average  root sugar concentration of 4%, significantly higher than the  3% averaged by those growing on grand fir or redcedar  habitat types. However, starch concentrations showed no  significant differences among the three habitat type series.  Root phenol concentrations (20.2%) and phenol/sugar ratios  (6.7) were significantly higher for trees growing on western  redcedar habitat types compared to grand fir and Douglas-fir  Figure 1.

Conversely, trees on  Douglas-fir habitat types showed significantly higher root  tannin concentrations than trees on either grand fir or western  redcedar habitat types and showed higher tannin/sugar ratios  than trees on grand fir habitat types. The average phenol/  tannin ratio for Douglas-fir habitat types was 14.6 compared  to mean ratios of 33.5 and 36.6 for grand fir and redcedar  habitat types, respectively.  Results of correlation analyses of the root chemistry  concentrations (i.e., sugar, starch, phenols, tannins) and  concentration ratios (i.e., phenol/sugar, tannin/sugar, phe-nol/  tannin) with plot growth rates, stand age, and Douglas-fir  site index are provided in Table 2. Net basal area growth  (BAG) and relative net basal area growth (RBAG) for the 10  yr just previous to root collection were positively correlated  with sugar concentrations in Douglas-fir roots. All other  correlations of plot growth rate, site index, or age with root  biochemical concentrations or ratios were nonsignificant.  Discussion  Root phenol, tannin, sugar and their ratios vary signifi-cantly  by habitat types for natural, forest-grown, mature  Douglas-fir trees (Figure 1). Sugar and tannin concentrations  are highest and phenol/tannin ratios lowest on dry, warm  Douglas-fir habitat types. Root phenol concentrations and  phenol/sugar ratios are highest on cool, moist redcedar habi-tat  types. There are several alternative explanations for these  results. Herms and Mattson (1992) suggest that plants face a  carbon allocation dilemma: whether to allocate more C to  sugar, starch, and cellulose production (i.e., rapid growth) or  to allocate relatively more C to the production of secondary  metabolites, such as phenols and tannins, which are impor-tant  in plant defense against diseases and insects. We at-tempted  to develop empirical support for Herms and Mattson’s  growth-differentiation balance hypothesis as an explanation  for our results by conducting the correlation analysis pre-sented  in Table 2. We expected to find significant negative  correlations between stand growth rate and phenol and tannin  concentrations; however, none of those correlations were  significant. We are not suggesting that our study is a rigorous  test of the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, merely  that the expected relationships between growth and second-ary  metabolites were not evident in our data. Perhaps this  result can be explained by nonlinear effects of resource  availability on secondary metabolism and resultant levels of  root phenols and tannins (Mattson and Haack 1987, Tuomi et  al. 1988, Horner 1990). Given our limited number of obser-vations,  we are unable to fully detect possible nonlinear  relationships between root chemical constituents and plot  growth rates. The only consistent relationship represented in  Table 2 is between root sugar concentration and stand growth  rate: faster growing Douglas-fir stands accumulated more  sugar in their roots. Stand growth rate is affected by stand  density as well as by site quality; due to the density effect, one  of the Douglas-fir habitat type sites grew faster than any other  site, despite a low site index. Therefore, stand growth rate  does not directly represent differences in site quality.  Trees growing on Douglas-fir habitat types were older  than those growing on grand fir and redcedar habitat types,  but age per se was not significantly correlated with root  chemical concentrations or their ratios. Thus, age differences  by habitat type in our study do not account for the observed  differences in root chemistry by habitat type.  Wargo (1980), working with sugar maple, and Entry et al.  (1991a, 1991b), working with Douglas-fir, reported that  increased levels of glucose enable the Armillaria fungus to  grow more rapidly in tree roots, making the fungus better able  to break down phenol compounds. Possible higher root sugar  concentrations in faster growing Douglas-fir stands would  cause them to be more susceptible to root rot infection;  however, the concurrent level of defense chemicals, such as  phenols, in the roots is also important in determining conifer  susceptibility to root disease (Entry et al. 1991b, Gebauer et  al. 1998).  Levels of resource availability—light, moisture, and  nutrients—affect the rates of net assimilation, growth, and  secondary metabolism. The functional relationships be-tween  these processes have not yet been established for  Douglas-fir, but our study provides insights into the out-comes  of these processes. The habitat type series included  provide a range of resource availability conditions in the  forests of the inland Northwest. The warm and dry Dou-glas-  fir habitat types represent the most resource-limited  conditions, while the cool and moist western redcedar  types represent the highest resource levels in our study  (Cooper et al. 1991, Neiman 1988). Our study did not have  on-site instrumentation to monitor short-term annual varia-tion  in temperature and moisture; rather, we relied on  general descriptions provided in the literature of environ-mental  conditions represented by different habitat types.  Habitat types reflect very long-term differences in the  environment and how plant communities have adapted to  those conditions. Rehfeldt (1989) demonstrated that Dou-glas-  fir is very tightly adapted to its environment, and  Myszewski (1999) showed strong Douglas-fir family dif-ferences  and heritabilities for the same root compounds  examined in our study. These findings, coupled with the  lack of correlation between stand growth rate and phenol  or tannin concentrations or their ratio in our study, leads us  to suggest that carbon allocation to phenols or tannins in  Basal  area  growtha  Relative  basal area  growthb  Site  indexc Age  Sugar 0.75* 0.86* –0.53 0.29  Starch 0.05 –0.11 0.44 –0.19  Tannin 0.34 0.51 –0.46 0.37  Phenol 0.20 –0.10 0.56 –0.67  Tannin/sugar –0.03 0.09 –0.19 0.25  Phenol/tannin –0.22 –0.52 0.69 –0.68  Phenol/sugar –0.32 –0.58 0.68 –0.59  Table 2.

Forest Science 46(4) 2000 535  Douglas-fir is under fairly strong genetic control. We  further speculate that root phenol and tannin levels would  be relatively unaffected by short-term differences in  weather patterns and consequent growth rate variation.  This idea should be tested in future work.  Douglas-fir trees growing on warm and dry Douglas-fir  habitat types had significantly higher sugar, lower phenols,  and lower phenol/sugar ratios in their roots than did  Douglas-fir growing on western redcedar habitat types.  Entry et al. (1991b) showed that the sugar concentration  and phenol/sugar ratio in Douglas-fir roots were strongly  positively correlated with the incidence of Armillaria  infection in the same trees. Furthermore, McDonald et al.  (1987) found that “incidence of pathogenic Armillaria  showed a strong tendency to decrease as habitat type  productivity increased. . . . The relatively less productive  Douglas-fir series exhibited high incidence of root disease  and the relatively more productive grand fir, western  redcedar, and western hemlock series significantly less.”  Root-rot-caused mortality on our eight study sites over the  10 yr period prior to root chemistry sampling shows the  same general pattern described by McDonald et al. (1987).  The average root-rot-caused mortality rates in our study  based on numbers of trees by habitat type were: 8.8% for  Douglas-fir; 4.2% for grand fir; and 1.5% for redcedar  habitat types. The high sugar concentrations and low root  phenol/sugar ratios we found, coupled with Entry et al.’s  (1991b) results, provide a plausible explanation for the  results of McDonald et al. Phenols are large, complex,  carbon-based molecules that require more energy for fungi  to break down than is obtained from the process. Sugars  provide a ready source of energy allowing fungi to grow  rapidly.  Douglas-fir root tannin concentration and tannin/sugar  ratios were significantly higher for Douglas-fir habitat  series, opposite to the pattern that we observed for phenols  and phenol/sugar ratio. Root phenol/tannin ratios were  significantly lower for Douglas-fir habitat types than they  were for grand fir and redcedar types. Tannins are second-ary  metabolites, as are phenols, and may play a role in  plant chemical defense against pests. For conifers, how-ever,  the function of tannins in resistance to disease and  insect infestation has not been as well established as it has  been for phenols. Defense is not the only role identified for  tannins in plants. Other functions include: structural sup-port  (Rhodes 1985, Haslam 1988); drought resistance  (Rhoades 1977, Bariska and Pizzi 1986, Pizzi and Cameron  1986); and protection of roots from acidic soil environ-ments  (Kimura and Wada 1989). The average site indices  by habitat type series for our study sites were: Douglas-fir  17; grand fir 22; and redcedar 26 m. If we consider  Douglas-fir site index as an expression of the degree of  moisture limitation, then Douglas-fir habitats are clearly  more limited with respect to moisture. We therefore specu-late  that the elevated root tannin levels of Douglas-fir  growing on the dry Douglas-fir habitat series reflect the  role of tannins in improved drought resistance. Further-more,  given the significantly lower phenol/tannin ratios  for Douglas-fir habitat types, our results suggest some  effect of moisture limitation on shifting carbon from  phenol to tannin production.  Our study is about the ecology of root biochemistry of  native Douglas-fir forests growing on a wide variety of sites  in the inland Northwest, but we can currently only speculate  about the physiological basis for our results. We certainly  realize that the observed differences in root chemistry are the  outcomes of myriad biological and physiological processes  and their complex interactions (well reviewed by Herms and  Mattson 1992). However, we feel our study results are  directly useful in generating hypotheses about the physi-ological  ecology of Douglas-fir and its interactions with  native pests at a landscape level in the inland Northwest.  Further, our results could help in the design of future physi-ological  studies aimed at testing such hypotheses concerning  factors influencing net assimilation, growth rates, and sec-ondary  metabolism that determine forest productivity across  the wide variety of site conditions in the inland Northwest.  Conclusions  Native Douglas-fir growing on different habitat type se-ries  showed significantly different concentrations and ratios  of root chemical compounds. Trees growing on dry, warm  Douglas-fir habitat types had significantly greater sugar  concentrations and significantly lower phenol/sugar ratios  than trees growing on more cool and moist grand fir and  western redcedar habitat types. These root chemical char-acteristics  suggest that Douglas-fir growing on Douglas-fir  habitat types may be less resistant to root rot infection,  particularly by Armillaria, than Douglas-fir growing on  grand fir and western redcedar habitat types.  The roots of Douglas-fir growing on Douglas-fir habitat  types were also higher in tannin concentration and had lower  phenol/tannin ratios. The higher tannin levels may improve  Douglas-fir drought resistance on the dry and warm Douglas-fir  habitat types.  The observed differences in root chemistry likely derive  from long-term adaptation of Douglas-fir to the different  environments represented by the habitat types included in our  study. These results are potentially important for Douglas-fir  genetic improvement programs as well as general seed and  seedling deployment strategies.  Literature Cited  BAZZAZ. F.A., N.R.

Four-Year Foliar and Growth Response to Multinutrient Fertilization in Northeast Oregon,"Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.","Results from this study show foliar nutrient deficiencies and multi-nutrient fertilization response for ponderosa pine, grand fir and Douglas-fir over a period of four consecutive growing seasons. Generally, through critical level or vector foliar diagnosis, N, S, B, Cu and possibly Mo were identified as being deficient for all species in this study. Additionally, Douglas-fir on the Noregaard site showed foliar K deficiency response. Distinct foliar nutrient response patterns were observed for those �strong responding� nutrients, particularly N and B where foliar response increased, peaked then declined in magnitude relative to the control as the year since fertilization increased. Delayed nutrient response may have been to spring fertilizer application not having manifested itself in time to show strong nutrient response one growing season after fertilization.  Similar to foliar nutrient response, foliar needle weight growth increased, peaked then declined in magnitude relative to the control as the year since fertilization increased. Additionally, needle weight response was delayed due to spring fertilization. Needle weight response was significant for ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir but not for grand fir.  Overall, four-year cubic foot volume response was significantly higher on the multi-nutrient treatment than the controls, with relative gross cubic foot volume response for both sites combined showing a 26.9% increase. Individual site response revealed that much of the combined relative cubic foot volume response was expressed on the Clear Creek site, which showed a 34% increase over the controls while the Noregaard site only showed a 3.9% increase. Periodic relative gross basal area response for both sites combined was greater in the first two-year period (26.9%) than the second two-year period (11.1%). Periodic relative basal area response for the Clear Creek unit was 32% the first two-year period and 23% the second two-year period while the Noregaard site response was 18.6% the first period and �6.5% the second.",2000-03-01,yes,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Shaw, T.M. and J.A.

Two-Year Basal Area Response to Multi-Nutrient Re-fertilization for Douglas-fir in South-Central Washington (Klickitat),"Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.","Six fertilization study sites located in the Klickitat region of south-central Washington were established and fertilized in 1990 and then re-fertilized in 1998. Six-year plot response by treatment from the initial fertilization was analyzed and presented in 1997. Two-year re-fertilization plot response by treatment is presented here in short summary form with a final report to follow after further analysis. A brief introduction with site characteristics (Table1), treatments (Table 2) plot response by treatment tables (Tables 3-6) and vector analysis interpretation and diagnosis (Figures 1) follow this summary.  Two-years after re-fertilization the average gross basal area response overall sites combined was - 3.7%, -3.7% and 0.1% for N, N+S and N+S+Micro applications, respectively (Table 3). In comparison, overall six-year volume response reported by Garrison (1997) was positive but was also poor with 10.3% and 8.4% response on the N and N+K applications, respectively (Table 4). Comparison of geologic parent materials underlying the sites showed that four installations occur on Wanapum basalt, one on Grande Ronde basalt and one on landslide olivine basalt. The Wanapum basalt and olivine basalt responded poorly but the single installation which occurred on a Grande Ronde basalt responded very well, with 30.7%, 36.0% and a significant (p &lt; 0.10) 61.3% for N, N+S and N+S+Micro applications, respectively (Table 5). Similarly, six-year volume response also showed this pattern with sites on Wanapum and olivine basalt  responding poorly (data not shown, Garrison et al, 1997) while Grande Ronde basalt response was good with 35.7% and 30% for the N and N+K applications (Table 6). It appears that all the significant (p &lt; 0.10) positive re-fertilization effect was due to the growth response of the Grande Ronde basalt. Notably, the addition of micro nutrients in the 1998 re-fertilization increased response over the N+S treatment by 25.3%. Notably, other IFTNC sites located on Grande Ronde and Wanapum parent materials show similar response trends. Grande Ronde sites almost always respond well to fertilization while Wanapum sites almost always respond poorly to fertilization.  Vector analysis of foliar response (Shaw and Moore, 1999) also diagnosed Grande Ronde basalt as the best responder to fertilization (Figure 1). Furthermore, vector analysis diagnosed good foliar response for Wanapum and olivine basalts, however, this good foliar response did not translate into good two-year basal area growth response for these two rock types. Perhaps nutrients other than those that were applied in the fertilizer mix were deficient and in-turn reduced response on the Wanapum and olivine basalts. For example, vector analysis identified possible Ca deficiencies for olivine basalt and P deficiencies for Wanapum basalt (Figure 1).

Albaugh  Forest Nutrition Cooperative, Department of Forestry,  North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.  Introduction  Historically, the practice of silviculture has focussed on controlling the composition, quantity, and structure of forest vegetation and the maintenance of site quality. As forest plantations have become important sources of fiber, fuel, and structural material, this custodial role has given way to active intervention to improve both plant and soil resources. Forest managers are finally recognizing that intensive plantation silviculture is like agronomy; both the plant and the soil need to be actively managed to optimize production. Silvicultural treatments including vegetation control and fertilization can dramatically effect site resource availability and the crop trees’ ability to acquire and utilize these resources. The key to optimizing production is to use the best genetic material available and to provide resources in quantities sufficient to allow the trees’ genetic potential to be realized. Effective manipulation of the genetic and site resources requires an understanding of what resources limit forest production, how these resources are affected by silvicultural treatment, and how crop trees may differ in their ability to acquire and utilize these resources. Fortunately, our understanding of the physiological and ecological processes regulating forest production has greatly increased during the last decade.  It is now generally accepted that much of the variation in wood production can be accounted for by variation in light interception. (Cannell 1989, Landsberg and Gower 1997, Linder 1987). Light interception is principally a function of the amount of leaf area and the duration of leaf area display. Empirical data from field studies with several conifer and broad-leaved species have shown that leaf area and consequently wood production are below optimum levels (Figure 1, Albaugh et al. 1998, Allen and Albaugh 1999, Benson et al. 1992, Colbert et al. 1990, Pereira et al. 1994, Snowdon and Benson 1992, Vose and Allen 1988). Low nutrient availability is a principal factor causing suboptimal levels of leaf area in many temperate humid areas (Albaugh et al 1998, Colbert et al. 1990). Low soil water availability and high vapor pressure deficits have also been shown to 1  adversely affect leaf area in areas with growing season water deficits (Benson et al. 1992, Hennessey et al. 1992, Pereira et al. 1994).  The variation in production per unit of leaf area (referred to as growth or leaf area efficiency) can also contribute to the variation in production. Growth efficiency can vary due to differences in photosynthetic efficiency, respiration, and partitioning to various biomass components. Improved nutrient and water availability has been shown to increase photosynthetic efficiency (Linder 1987) and aboveground productivity proportionally more than belowground productivity in stand-level studies (Albaugh et al. 1998, Allen and Albaugh 1999, Gower et al. 1994).  Resource Limitations  Low soil water availability has been considered by many to be the principal resource limiting forest productivity (Gholz et al. 1990). This is probably true for seedlings that exploit a limited soil volume (Dougherty and Gresham 1988) however, once roots have fully exploited most soils, low soil water availability and/or high vapor pressure deficits will only limit production in areas with Mediterranean climates or subtropical or tropical savannas. During the rainy season, stands on these same sites may be strongly limited by nutrients. Evidence for the secondary importance of water includes the widespread growth responses found in fertilizer trials (Binkley et al. 1995) and the modest responses to water additions as compared with nutrient additions in trials that have included both (Albaugh et al. 1998, Bergh et al. 1998, Linder 1987). Clearly, in most humid temperate areas, nutrient limitations are more limiting to leaf area and consequently production than water. Fortunately, nutrient limitations are easier and less costly to ameliorate than water limitations.  To effectively ameliorate resource limitations with silvicultural treatments, forest managers must be able to identify what resources (e.g. light, water, nutrients, and oxygen) are limiting production of crop trees. A resource limitation develops when a tree or stand's production potential, given the level of all other resources, cannot be achieved because of a lack of available supply of that resource. Resource use and availability varies spatially, within a tree, a stand, and across sites and also temporally, within a day, a growing season, and over a rotation. These spatial and temporal variations in potential use and supply make the identification and ranking of importance of the resources that limit production a challenge. Since forest production is generally considered on an 2  annual basis and at the stand level, it is very likely that more than one resource (e.g. water or different nutrients) will limit production.  Silvicultural treatments can have either positive, or, if inappropriately applied, negative effects on site resource availability and the allocation of resources to crop trees. The most obvious method for ameliorating a resource limitation is to add more of that resource. For example, nutrients can be added by fertilization. However, very significant impacts can be made on resource availability without additions. Allocating site resources to crop trees by controlling other vegetation and/or increasing the availability of existing resources by changing the soil environment can have as much, or more, impact on production as adding limiting resources (Allen et al. 1990).  Ameliorating Nutrient Limitations  In the Southeastern USA, nutrient limitations are very widespread and nutrient additions are needed on most sites to achieve optimum rates of production. Much attention has been focussed on ameliorating the gross and highly visual deficiencies of phosphorus (P). On P-deficient sites, pines routinely receive fertilizer applications that provide the equivalent 20 to 40 g of P per seedling immediately before or soon after planting (Allen 1987, Jokela et al. 1991). Fertilizers are typically applied by tractor (band or broadcast) or broadcast from the air. The sources of P that are used include diammonium phosphate (DAP), triple superphosphate (TSP), rock phosphate, or NPK blends (e.g. 10-10-10). The benefits of early P fertilization on the wet P deficient soils typical of the southeastern coastal plain have long been recognized with long-term volume gains range from 3 to over 10 m3/ha/year on severely deficient sites (Pritchett and Comerford 1982, Gent et al. 1986). More recently, we have found that large long-term gains are possible on well-drained sites in the Gulf coastal plain (Allen and Lein 1998, Figure 2). Because the response to applications of 40 to 50 kg/ha P continue to increase for 20 or more years, P fertilization on deficient sites is viewed by many as an improvement in site quality, a Type A (Morris and Lowery 1988) or Type II (Snowdon and Waring 1984) response.  Identification of stands in need of early fertilization has been based on landscape/soil type, soil and foliar tests, and experience. With the advent of effective vegetation control, it is now apparent that early fertilization will improve growth even on sites that have not previously been considered nutrient deficient. 3  Non-Crop Vegetation Control  The allocation of resources to crop trees can be increased by reducing the use of resources by non-crop vegetation. Prior to planting, both mechanical (e.g. chopping, shearing, piling, and tillage) and/or chemical site preparation treatments are widely used where woody vegetation such as sprouts and seedlings of tree species, or waxy leaved brush species (e.g. ericaceous shrubs), rapidly become competitors with the planted species. Over the last decade, there has been a shift to greater use of chemical treatments as new chemicals and tank mixes have been registered that are more effective at reducing the sprouting of undesirable species, have less risk of erosion and soil damage, allow for the treatment of large areas in a short period of time, and can be less expensive. Mechanical treatments are still used where the use of herbicides is restricted and/or where debris removal or the need for soil tillage dictates the use of mechanical methods. Where competing woody vegetation is a problem and it is effectively controlled, substantial gains in survival, individual tree growth, and stand yield have been realized (Clason 1993, Glover and Zutter 1993, Zutter et al. 1995). Analyses indicate that a negative exponential relationship exists between final crop tree yield and number of hardwood stems at a young age (Glover and Zutter 1993, Figure 3).  Effective reduction of non-crop vegetative regrowth does not end with site preparation. In most areas, effective grass, herbaceous, and brush control during the first year of plantation establishment is essential for rapid early growth of the planted species. This is true for replanting of previously forest sites or reforestation of pastureland. Several very effective pre- and post- emergent herbicides are presently available and their use has resulted in early height growth gains from 1 to 2 m across a broad range of site and climatic conditions (Fortson et al. 1996, Lauer et al. 1993). On most sites, the early growth gains found with weed control do not continue to increase over time; long-term results indicate that early gains have been maintained with treated and non-treated areas showing parallel growth projectories (Lauer et al. 1993). This type of response has been described as Type B (Morris and Lowery 1988) or Type I (Snowdon and Waring 1984). On other sites, the early growth responses have been partially lost (Figure 4, Allen and Lein 1998) with time (Type C or Type III (Richardson 1993) responses). Clearly, an understanding of the resources that limit production and the effectiveness of the vegetation control treatments in ameliorating these limitations over the short and long term are needed to make projections.  4  Depending on the composition and quantity of the competition vegetation, plantation spacing, and the growth rate of the crop trees, additional release treatments may be needed in subsequent years to optimize growth.  Interactions between Fertilization and Vegetation Control  When fertilization and vegetation control treatments are applied, three outcomes are possible. The response to the combination may be greater than the additive effects of the individual treatments (positive interaction), the response may be additive (no interaction), or the response may be less than additive (negative interaction). The outcome of combining fertilization and vegetation control treatments is particularly difficult to predict because vegetation control is known to have positive effects on soil nutrient availability (Li 2000, Vitousek et al. 1992) and the allocation of nutrients to crop trees (Allen and Wentworth 1993, Zutter et al. 1999). To determine the likely outcome, several questions need to be addressed including:  •  What resources limit production?  •  What is the resource requirement of crop tree species?  •  What resource limitations are being ameliorated by fertilization and by vegetation control?  •  Do the treatments ameliorate the same or different resource limitations?  •  How do the treatments influence competing vegetation?  Where fertilization and vegetation control ameliorate different resource limitations, their combined effects may be additive or better. A typical example occurs on moderately fertile well-drained sites where broad-leaved species can be major competitors to planted loblolly pine. On these sites, the effects of effective hardwood control and fertilization are generally more than additive because with hardwood control, the pines are able to respond to the added nutrients. Without hardwood control, the hardwoods will utilize the added nutrients and respond with increased growth resulting in increased competition for light and water resources with pine crop trees (Figure 5, Allen and Lein 1998). Another example is on grossly P-deficient wet soils where the effects of herbaceous weed control and P fertilization on loblolly pine growth are generally additive (Jokela and Morris 1998). On these sites, fertilization provides much needed P and effective herbaceous weed control increases light and water availability to young seedlings. Although weed control may result in more nutrients to the planted seedlings (Zutter et al. 1999), P additions are needed to meet loblolly pine’s P requirements for optimum growth.  5  Where fertilization and vegetation control ameliorate the same resource limitation (i.e. nutrients), the combined treatment may be less than additive. A typical example occurs on infertile poorly- drained soils where waxy-leaved shrub species can be major competitors to planted pine (Lauer and Glover 1998, 1999, Zutter and Miller 1998). On these sites, the effects of vegetation control and fertilization are generally less than additive for slash pine (Figure 6, Pienaar et al 1998). Slash pines are very responsive to either nutrient addition or vegetation control. With shrub control, slash pines are apparently provided with enough nutrients to meet their modest requirements and the addition of nutrients elicits a good, but less than additive, response.  Based on our understanding of resources and how they are affected by fertilization and vegetation control, we hypothesize that:  •  Effective vegetation control, where broad-leaved species are present, and fertilization will be more than additive for species with high nutrient requirements.  •  Herbaceous weed control and fertilization will be additive.  •  Effective vegetation control and fertilization will be less than additive for species with low nutrient requirements.  It is clear that obtaining optimum plantation production will require the use of integrated systems that couple intensive management of site resources and genetics. Much research is now underway to understand the interactions among silvicultural treatments and genetics. The beneficial effects of improved genetics and intensive culture appear to be at least additive (McKeand et al 1997, Shiver et al. 1998). Clonal forestry also brings new challenges. Procedures for selecting and deploying clones must be optimized with an understanding of how to effectively take advantage of genetic x environment interactions that are often found with clones.  The potential growth rates for forest plantations in the southeastern USA are very high, much higher than commonly thought just a few years ago (Sampson and Allen 1999). In the last five years, our expectations have increased dramatically. Our challenge now is to develop and implement the appropriate silvicultural systems to realize this potential in a cost effective and environmental sustainable way. To be successful will require a basic understanding of how resource availability limits forest production and how crop trees may differ in their ability to acquire and utilize these resources. Key challenges from a resource management perspective include: understanding the relative contributions of water and nutrient limitations to stand productivity  6  across a range of site and stand developmental conditions, assessing resource limitations that are constantly changing, understanding the impacts of intensively managed plantations within a landscape context, developing people capable of making the site specific prescriptions, and securing the capital sufficient to implement those prescriptions.

EFFECT OF ROOT PLUG INCORPORATED CONTROLLED-RELEASE  FERTILIZER UPON TWO-YEAR PERFORMANCE OF PLANTED PONDEROSA  PINE SEEDLINGS  ABSTRACT  2  Three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow  release (SR)) were incorporated in the root plug at rates of0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams per seedling  at the time of sowing as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on  seedling growth, survival and foliar nutrient status of the ""160/90"" container ponderosa pine  (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) were evaluated after outplanting. At the end of the second  growing season, fertilized seedlings had significantly greater caliper and height than  unfertilized seedlings. Fertilization significantly increased relative height growth rate, but  did not significantly increase relative caliper growth rate. Most treatments had lower caliper  growth rates than the controls. The differences between the 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer  treatments and the controls were statistically significant. Height growth response was  attributable to fertilizer doses rather than fertilizer types. The 3.2 grams ofMR or SR  fertilizer treatments produced significantly higher mortality (55 and 36 %, respectively) than  the controls. The mortality was strongly correlated with root growth potential. Foliar Nand  Mo concentrations were significantly influenced by fertilization during the first growing  season. During the second growing season, foliar Cu, Fe and K concentrations were found to  be deficient or nearly deficient even after fertilization.  3  INTRODUCTION  Initial fertilizer toxicity and later deficiency in seedlings and most factors contributing to  loss of efficiency in seedling fertilization are directly related to rapid dissolution and  hydrolysis of the applied fertilizers. Controlled-release fertilizers may be considered as  potential solutions to the problem because they provide a continuous supply of nutrients  over an extended time period. Brockley (1988) discussed the potential for incorporating  controlled-release fertilizers in the root plug of containerized seedlings for stimulating  greenhouse and field growth performance and simplifying fertilizer operations. However,  the reported results were not consistent. Few studies have explored the mechanisms behind  the observed growth response. Fertilization research with controlled-release fertilizers is still  empirical and in the stage of knowledge accumulation. Process-oriented research is needed  to improve our understanding of mechanisms that control the response (Brockley 1988). The  release characteristics, relative nutrient proportions and application rates of controlled­release  fertilizers (Patel and Sharma 1977), and their interaction with stock type (Landis and  Simonich 1984) were identified as priorities for future research.  We established a fertilization experiment with three controlled-release fertilizers  characterized by various release rates and nutrient proportions in the production of  container-grown ponderosa pine seedlings. Seedlings were then planted on the University of  Idaho Experimental Forest in April of 1997. The study's objective was to evaluate the effect  of three controlled-release fertilizers and several application rates on ponderosa pine  seedling survival, growth and nutrient status. Specifically, the study addressed the following  questions:  (1) What are the differences in growth and survival between fertilized and unfertilized  ponderosa pine seedlings?  (2) How are growth and survival affected by fertilizer types and dosage?  (3) What effect does fertilization have on seedling foliar nutrient status and how is foliar  nutrition related to growth and survival? and  (4) What effect does fertilization have on seedling root growth potential (RGP) and how is  RGP related to growth and survival?  4  Based on the answers to the questions above, we make recommendations on fertilizer  products and dosages to achieve maximum growth response and balanced seedling nutrition.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Site description  The experiment was located in Latah county in northern Idaho at 46° 51' N and 116°50'  W., elevation 950 m. The Vassar Silt Loam soil at the site is 1.5 m deep. The habitat type is  Abies grandis/Ciitonia uniflora (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968). In winter, the average  temperature is 0 °C, and the average daily minimum temperature is -4 °C. In summer, the  average temperature is 17 °C, and the average daily maximum temperature is 27 °C. Located  just out of the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains, the summers begin moist and  gradually turn dry by mid-July and continue mostly without appreciable rain through mid­September.  October has an increasing chance of rainfall. As autumn progresses into winter,  the precipitation increases dramatically falling as either snow or rain. The total annual  precipitation is 763 mm. Of this, 267 mm, or 35 percent, usually falls in April through  September (Osborne and Appelgren 1996). The study site was clearcut in 1995 and the  slash burned in the spring of 1996.  5  Experimental design and treatments  The experiment was arranged as a randomized complete block design with six  blocks on a one-acre trial. In each block, thirty-six ponderosa pine seedlings from each  treatment were assigned randomly to a square plot of size 8 by 8 m with trees planted at 1.3  by 1.3 m spacing. All ponderosa pine seedlings planted for this study were grown the  previous year (1996) at the University ofldaho Forest Research Nursery. Seedlings were  stored at 0.5 °C, with relative humidity near 100 percent for 5 months (from December of  the previous year to April) before outplanting. The controlled-release fertilizers (Table 1)  were applied into the planting medium prior to sowing so they were incorporated in the root  plugs of""l60/90"" containerized ponderosa pine seedlings. The fertilization treatments were  the control (no controlled-release fertilizer), and 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 grams per seedling of three  controlled-release products: fast release, moderate release and slow release, a total of 10  treatments. All seedlings were planted on April 201h through 22""d, 1997.  Prior to planting, thirty-two seedlings for each treatment were randomly selected for  root growth potential (RGP) testing. These seedlings were placed in 3.78-liter pots filled  with the 50/50 percent peat-vermiculite growing media, and grown in the same greenhouse  environment as before. Seedlings were watered to maintain the maximum water-holding  potential for the media. The RGP experiment ended four weeks later after 80% of the buds  had broken dormancy. Roots were extracted from the pots and washed carefully from the  medium. RGP index was evaluated based on the following criteria (Burdett 1979):  0----- no new roots growth  1----- some new roots but none over 1 em long  6  2----- 1-3 new roots over 1 em long  3----- 4-10 new roots over 1 em long  4----- 11-30 new roots over 1 em long  5----- &gt; 30 new roots over 1 em long  Field sampling and measurements  The potential variation in soil, seedling quality and the amount of fertilizer incorporated in  the root plug was considered in the design. Thus we used square plots as sampling units rather  than individual seedlings to investigate seedling response to fertilization treatments. The  response variables of interest are mean caliper (diameter at the root collar), height, survival and  foliage nutrient concentrations. Seedling height and caliper were measured at planting and at the  end of each growing season (November). Relative caliper and height growth rates (RGR) were  calculated for each plot by:  (1)  Where Y 1 and Y 2 are the seedling's mean caliper or height for each plot at two points in  time (T 1 and T 2). Survival was surveyed bi-weekly throughout the first growing season and  was calculated for each plot as the percentage ofliving seedlings of the total number of  planted seedlings. At the end of each growing season, three needle fascicles surrounding the  apical bud were picked from each interior seedling in a plot. Needles were oven-dried at  70°C for 2 days and ground for chemical analysis. The following nutrients were analyzed:  N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn and Mo, which were all included in the controlled-release  fertilizers products. Foliar nitrogen was determined using a standard mico-Kjeldahl  7  procedure. Phosphorus, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn were determined by inductively  coupled plasma (ICP) emission from digested plant tissue. Scotts Laboratories in Allentown,  PA completed both procedures. Soil moisture and temperature at 10, 20 and 40 em depths, at  six points distributed uniformly across the trial were also monitored bi-weekly throughout  the first growing season. These data were used to evaluate impacts on seedling growth and  mortality. At the end of the second growing season, sixteen plots were systematically  selected as sampling points for soil chemical analysis. Sample locations were selected such  that they were unaffected by fertilizers contained in the seedling root plugs. In each plot,  four 30cm deep soil cores, one from each quadrant, were taken and composited for soil pH,  N03- -N, available P, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg analyses. Soil pH was  measured 1:1 in H20. Nitrate was extracted with calcium oxide and determined using  automated colorimetry. Exchangeable K, Ca and Mg (1 N ammonium acetate, pH 3.0) were  analyzed by ICP spectrometry. Available P (for soil with pH&lt; 7.2) was determined on a 2-g  sub-sample of soil extracted with 12 mL of Bray's solution (Bray and Kurtz 1945).  Available Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe were determined by atomic absorption.  Data analysis  Average caliper and height based on the sixteen interior seedlings from each plot were  used in the statistical analysis. Caliper and height relative growth rates were also used as  response variables. Dunnett's multiple comparison test (Kirk 1995) was conducted to test for  differences in first and second-year survival, foliar nutrient concentrations, caliper, height  and relative growth rates at the end of the second growing season (1998) between the nine  fertilization treatments and the control. We tested the effects of fertilizer types and dosage  on the final caliper and height of ponderosa pine seedlings using analysis of covariance  (with caliper and height at planting as covariates). Analysis of variance (ANOV A) was  conducted to test fertilization effects on caliper and height growth rates and foliar nutrient  concentrations. Regression analysis of second-year caliper and height as related to fertilizer  dosage was performed using a parabolic model of the form:  (2)  where Y is the seedling caliper (mm) or height (em), X is the application rate (gram per  seedling), ao, a1 and a2 are the regression coefficients, and E is the random error term under  standard linear regression assumptions. The estimated fertilizer dosage associated with  maximum caliper and height for each type of fertilizer was calculated via differentiation:  estimated application rate= -a1 I 2 a2 (3)  Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to determine relationships between foliar  nutrient concentrations and growth. Duncan's multiple-range test was used to compare  differences in RGP between fertilizer treatments. The statistical computations were  performed using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure of SAS (SAS® Institute Inc.  1995).  RESULTS  Soil nutrient concentrations, moisture and temperature regimes  Mean values for soil chemical and physical properties are shown in Table 2 and Figure  1. Soil nitrate and Cu concentrations at the experimental site were very low. The  experimental site experienced a dry period from mid-July until late September. The soil  moisture between 11-40 em deep during this period was less than 25%. Such low soil  8  moisture can reduce nutrient release and tree growth. Soil temperatures remained moderate  for fertilizer release during the period.  Caliper and height growth  9  At the end of the second growing season, all fertilization treatments except the 3.2 grams  per seedling of moderate-release (MR) and slow-release (SR) fertilizer treatments produced  significantly {p=O.OOOI) larger calipers than the control (Figure 2a). These two treatments  had lower caliper growth rates than the control (Figure 2b ). All treatments produced taller  seedlings than the control at the end of the second growing season, except for the SR -0.8  treatment (Figure 3a). Relative height growth rates did not significantly increase (p&gt;0.05)  for the 0.8 rate for all fertilizer types and the 3.2 SR treatment (Figure 3b ).  Both ANCOV A and ANOV A results (Table 3) show that dose rather than fertilizer  release rate accounts for most of the variation in caliper and height growth. The interaction  of fertilizer by dose significantly affected relative caliper growth rate, while there was no  significant interaction effect on final caliper, final height or relative height growth rate.  Regression summary for the parabolic model given in equation (2) is provided in Table 4.  The model fit the data well and residual analysis showed no detectable trend. Based on the  parabolic fit, the dose for achieving the maximum caliper at the end of the second growing  season solving equation (3) was 1.96, 1.84 and 1.84 grams for FR, MR and SR products  respectively, and 1.86, 2.02 and 2.06 grams for FR, MR and SR products respectively  produced the maximum height response.  10  Survival and root growth potential (RGP)  Seedling survival varied significantly between fertilization treatments primarily due to  the 3.2 MR or SR treatments that had much lower survival than the controls for the first two  years (Figure 4). Fertilizer types, doses, and their interactions produced this result {Table 5).  There were no survival differences between the other fertilization treatments (Figure 4).  Seedling death mainly occurred within the first two months after planting and only 3. 7% of  the seedlings died after that time. Overall mortality at the end of the first growing season  was 14% (Figure 5). Very few seedlings (1.4%) died during the second growing season.  Ponderosa pine treated with both fast and moderate-release fertilizers had similar survival  patterns after one year. Mortality rate increased as rate increased from 0.8 to 1.6 grams and  then decreased as rate further increased from 1.6 to 3.2 grams. The treatments differed in  that survival dropped sharply with doses (from 1.6 to 3.2 grams) for MR fertilizer, but  decreased only slightly for the same doses ofFR fertilizer. Survival of ponderosa pine  treated with SR fertilizer decreased with increasing dosage, particularly for the 3.2 grams  per seedling rate (Figure 4).  Seedling mortality mainly resulted from dead root plugs (73.6%). The 3.2 grams ofMR  or SR fertilizer treatments produced most of the dead root plugs. Root growth potential tests  showed that these two treatments resulted in significantly lower RGP than the controls and  other fertilizer treatments (Figure 6). The 0.8 grams ofFR or SR fertilizer treatments  produced significantly higher RGP than the controls. No significant RGP difference was  found between other treatments (Figure 6). Field mortality decreased exponentially with  increasing seedling RGP index (Figure 7).  Foliar nutrients  Treatments MR-3.2, SR-1.6 and SR-3.2 produced lower foliar Mo concentrations and  treatments FR-1.6, MR-0.8, MR-3.2, SR-1.6 and SR-3.2 resulted in lower foliar N  concentrations than the control at the end of the first growing season (p&lt;0.05). No  II  treatments were different from the control for other nutrients. At the end of the second  growing season, the FR-0.8 treatment produced higher foliar Cu concentration, SR-3.2lower  foliar N concentration, and FR-1.6 and MR-0.8 higher foliar P concentrations than the  control (P=0.05). No difference was found after the second year for other treatments and  nutrients (Table 6).  ANOV A showed that foliar N, B, Cu and Mo concentrations at the end of the first  growing season were significantly accounted for by fertilizer types (P&lt;0.1 ); however, foliar  Mg varied significantly by doses rather than fertilizer types (P&lt;0.005). The FR fertilizer  produced the highest foliar N, B, Cu and Mo concentrations, while the SR fertilizer was  lowest and the MR fertilizer was intermediate. At the end of the second growing season,  differences in foliar Ca and Zn resulted from fertilizer doses applied (P&lt;0.05), foliar Cu  from both dose and the interaction of dose by fertilizer type (P&lt;O.O 1) and foliar P  concentration from fertilizer type (P&lt;0.01).  Based on the critical foliar nutrient concentrations for ponderosa pine (Powers 1983,  Powers et al. 1985, Boyer 1984 (unpublished)), Fe was deficient for the first two years and  Cu was deficient for the first year. Foliar Cu and K for the second year were only slightly  higher than their respective critical values and were possibly deficient (Table 6). Based on  the non-species-specific critical and optimal nutrient ratios (Van den Driessche 1974), our  KIN ratio was below the critical ratio and the ratios of PIN and Mg/N were slightly over the  12  critical ratios but were lower than the optimal ratios. The CaiN ratio was above the optimal  ratio but all other ratios were below optimal (Table 7).  The relationship between foliar nutrient status, growth and survival.  During the first growing season, caliper growth rate was positively related to foliar N,  Ca and B concentrations, and negatively related to foliar K concentration and the PIN, KIN,  and Mg!N, ratios (Table 8). Height growth rate was positively related to foliar P, Mg and  Mn concentrations, and negatively related to foliar Cu concentration. During the second  growing season, caliper growth rate was positively related to foliar N concentration and  negatively related to the concentration ratios of all macronutrients to N. Height growth was  positively related to foliar Mn concentration and negatively related to foliar B concentration.  The negative relationship can be interpreted as either growth dilution or deficiency.  However, based on the results presented in Table 6, except for the Cu deficiency, all  negative relationships are assumed to reflect growth dilution. Significant correlation between  relative growth rate and foliar nutrient concentration and concentration ratios were observed  more frequently for caliper than for height suggesting that caliper growth was more affected  by foliar nutrient status than was height growth. First year mortality was negatively related  to foliar N, Mg, B, Mn and Mo concentrations, but positively related to the PIN ratio. Foliar  concentrations ofP, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, and Mo in 1998 were not significantly correlated  with any response variables and therefore were not included in Table 8.  13  DISSCUSION  Caliper and height growth  There is no evidence that fertilization increased caliper growth rate two years after field  planting. Of the nine fertilization treatments, six treatments were lower and three treatments  were slightly greater than the control with respect to caliper growth rate after planting.  Therefore, when compared to the unfertilized seedlings, the significantly larger caliper of  fertilized ponderosa pine measured after two years was mainly due to their size differences  at the time of planting rather than subsequently greater field growth rate. The 3.2 grams of  MR or SR fertilizer treatments greatly reduced caliper growth, while the 3.2 grams of FR  fertilizer treatment increased caliper growth. The 1.6 grams of MR fertilizer achieved  maximum field caliper growth rate (Figure 2b ).  Fertilization significantly increased ponderosa pine seedling height at the end of the  second growing season. The taller seedlings resulted from both their larger initial size  resulting from treatment effects while in the greenhouse as well as higher growth rate after  planting (Figure 3b and Table 3). Differences in height and height growth rate among the  fertilized seedlings resulted from dosage differences rather than fertilizer types or the  interaction of fertilizer type by dosage (Table 3). Neither 0.8 grams ofFR, MR or SR  fertilizer nor 3.2 grams ofSR fertilizer produced significantly greater height growth rate  than the control (Figure 3b ). Field height growth was more affected by fertilization  treatments than was caliper growth. As suggested by the parabolic fit (Table 4), the best  dosage for both caliper and height growth should be between 1.8 and 2.1 grams per seedling.  14  The relationship between mortality and fertilizer release rate  Brockley's (1988) finding that continuous nutrient release and extremely high salinity  buildup and toxicity during cold storage likely explained our dead root plugs. Root growth  potential tests showed that incorporating high doses of controlled-release fertilizers in the  containers resulted in lower root growth potential. Many dead root plugs were found with  the 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer treatments. The strong association between RGP and  field mortality (Figure 7) suggests that high mortality was attributable to low seedling RGP.  Unbalanced physiological and morphological characteristics of the seedlings such as  nutrient imbalance within plant organs and high shoot/root ratios were the probable factors  leading to ponderosa pine mortality. Necrotic needle tips were observed within two weeks of  planting for the 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer treatments. Moisture content in the top 40  em of soil was greater than 30% before the end June (Figure 1) by which time 83.2% of the  overall mortality had occurred. Low soil moisture per se did not contribute to high seedling  mortality.  Some of the MR and SR fertilizers still remained in the root plugs when the seedlings  were placed in cold storage, while most FR fertilizer had already been released. This is  evidenced by the much better survival for the FR-3.2 treatment compared to the same rate of  MR or SR fertilizers (Figure 4). These results suggest that dosage should be lower for  fertilizers whose release periods are longer than the nursery's production cycle to avoid  seedling damage caused by continuous release and salinity buildup in the root plug during  cold storage before planting. Results may have been very different if the seedlings had been  fall planted rather than placed in cold storage waiting for spring planting.  15  Foliar nutrient status and seedling growth.  In our study, foliar nutrients were generally poorly correlated with soil nutrients. No  significant associations were found for all nutrients other than P. For example, foliar Fe and  K were diagnosed as deficient and nearly deficient even though soil available Fe and K were  high (Table 2). Foliar Cu was deficient for the first year and only slightly above its critical  value for the second year and soil available Cu was also deficient. Since we fertilized the  seedlings rather than the site, lower soil nutrient availability was not the only reason for  foliar nutrient deficiency. The deficiency of foliar micronutrients, such as Cu. Zn and Fe,  may be caused by application of high levels ofN and Prather than low soil nutrient  availability (Miller and Cooper 1973, Teng and Timmer 1990). We believe that foliar Fe and  K deficiency in our study was related to the high level of foliar N. No matter the reason,  foliar nutrient deficiency may be corrected by increasing the nutrient proportion in the  fertilizer. particularly, the proportions ofK, Fe and Cu.  Because of the complexity of nutrient remobilization and translocation between the plant  and soil, and the interaction between nutrients, many fertilization practices have been based  on both soil and plant tissue (mostly the foliage) analysis. The relationship between foliar  nutrient status and tree growth has usually been obscured in the absence of biomass and  nutrient uptake information (Imo and Timmer 1996). To minimize this problem, we used  relative growth rate rather than absolute size of ponderosa pine seedlings to do correlation  analyses and conducted these analyses not only for the same time period but for different  time periods, i.e. the correlation between second-year's relative growth rate and first-year's  foliar nutrient concentrations and nutrient ratios. This analysis approach clarifies that caliper  growth was mainly attributable to foliar N concentration. particularly during the second  17  dosage for achieving maximum caliper and height should be 1. 7 and 1.93 gram per seedling,  respectively.  Ponderosa pine mortality mainly occurred within the first two months after planting.  Incorporating 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer in the root plug produced significantly higher  mortality (54 and 36 %, respectively), which resulted from lower RGP caused by nutrient  toxicity due to the continuous nutrient release for these two fertilizers during cold storage.  None of the fertilization treatments applied in the root plug prior to the container  nursery-growing regime were entirely effective in stimulating seedling growth after  planting. We feel the key for future improvement is extension of the product release time  period past seedling cold storage into the first growing season after spring planting. Another  possibility would be to test fall planting with the higher rates of slower release fertilizers.  18  LITERATURE CITED  Bray, R. H., and L. T. Kurtz. 1945.

Fertilization trials have been established to test not only fertilizer sources, application  rate, application time and placement method but how these factors interact with stock type and  cultural treatments such as site preparation and vegetation control to affect response magnitude  and duration (Brockley 1988). Steady-state nutrition theory (Ingestad 197 4,1977; Ingestad and  Lund 1986; Ingestad and Agren 1988) suggests that seedling growth and nutrient uptake can be  maximized and loss minimized by supplying small quantities of nutrients in proportion to  requirements. Matching seedling growth with nutrient uptake using exponentially increasing  application rates is important for maintaining steady-state nutrition and stable internal nutrient  concentration in the plants. Short-term experiments with potted seedlings using nutrient-solution  cultures by Imo and Timmer (1992) showed that exponentially based fertilization achieved  steady-state nutrition and enhanced plant nutrient status, uptake and growth.  Factors contributing to loss of fertilizer efficiency are directly related to rapid dissolution and  hydrolysis of the applied fertilizers. An efficient uptake rate and significant response could  potentially be achieved by applying controlled-release fertilizers. Coating or encapsulating  soluble compounds with materials that delay or slow the release rate achieves these controlled-release  characteristics.  Several studies have reported on the effects of slow-release fertilizers on tree growth and/or  soil chemical properties (Carlson 1981; Hunt 1989; Walker and Huntt 1992; Knowles et al. 1993;  Walker and Kane 1997; Yanai et al. 1997; Catanzaro et al. 1998). Brockley (1988) summarized  research results from Canada dealing with controlled-release fertilizers incorporated in container  5  grown seedling root plugs. He felt that release rate and application rate were the key factors  determining controlled-release fertilizer performance. Currently little information is available for  conditions and species commonly grown in the inland Northwest of the United States. Therefore,  the principal objective of our study was to investigate the effect of three controlled-release  fertilizers with different release rates applied at three different rates on the growth, biomass  allocation and root growth potential of ponderosa pine seedlings. Based on the results, we could  estimate optimum fertilizer application rates to grow containerized ponderosa pine seedlings  using the various products, and generally learn more about controlled-release fertilizers in  container nurseries.  Materials and Methods  Treatments and experimental design  The Scotts Company provided the three types of controlled-release fertilizers (Table 1) tested  in this study. Ponderosa pine seedlings were grown in 160/90 styroblocks ( 160 cavities per block,  90 cm3 per cavity). For each type of the three controlled-release fertilizers, three application rates  of 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 grams per seedling were incorporated in the growing media prior to sowing  the ponderosa pine seed. No controlled-release products were incorporated in the growing media  for the control treatments. The study was conducted at the University ofldaho Forest Research  Nursery from February 1996 until April 1997. A completely randomized design with 4 replicates  was used to detect fertilizer effects. Controlled-release fertilizer was applied into a 50/50 percent  peat-vermiculite growing medium (pH 4.2) and then cells were hand filled with the mixture.  Ponderosa pine seeds were sown with a vacuum seeder and covered with about 0.6 em of Target  Forestry Sand®. Once sowing was complete, the containers were irrigated until the media was  1  l  l  j  l  ~  j  l  l  l  l  i )  l  ,J !  i  l  r l  r ' r  r  ~  t  ~~  '· r  f~  r \  r ' r L  r  r '  I l  r  r  F""  I  r I  l  6  thoroughly moist. Phosphoric acid was injected into the irrigation water to adjust pH to around  6.0. The seed germination process was completed by March 22nd and cells were then thinned to  one seedling when most seedlings shed their seed coats. During the growth phase (from March to  June), day temperatures of24-27 °C and night temperatures around 18 °C were maintained.  Photoperiod was extended to 24 hours in the greenhouse. Wenny and Dumroese (1987) describe  the growing regime for ponderosa pine in detail. The nursery based fertilization schedule they  describe was in addition to the fertilization treatments included in our study.  Seedling measurements, biomass harvest and root growth potential test  At lifting on December 1, 1996, a random sample of thirty-two seedlings (eight seedlings  per replication) for each treatment was harvested for seedling caliper, height and biomass  measurements. Each seedling was cut at the root collar, and the roots extracted from the cells  and hand washed. The shoot was separated into needle and stem components. The needle,  stem and root samples were weighed after oven drying at 70 C for 48 hours. The needle  weight ratio (NWR), stem weight ratio (SWR) and root weight ratio (R WR) were calculated  as the ratio of the foliage, stem and roots, respectively, to total seedling dry weight. In  addition, shoot (needle + stem)/root ratio was calculated for detecting fertilization treatment  effects on biomass allocation between components.  The remaining seedlings from each treatment were wrapped with plastic after lifting and  placed into polylined wax boxes for cold storage. The refrigerated storage was kept at 0.5  °C, with relative humidity near 1 00 percent. Before outplanting for a longer term field  performance study in late April 1997, a random sample of thirty-two seedlings for each  treatment was selected for root growth potential testing. Seedlings were placed in 3.78-liter  7  pots filled with the 50/50 percent peat-vermiculite growing media, and grown in the same  greenhouse environment as before. Seedlings were watered to maintain maximum water-holding  potential for the media. The root growth potential experiment ended four weeks later  after 80% of the buds had broken donnancy. Seedlings were extracted from the pots and  medium washed carefully from the roots. Root growth potential index was evaluated based  on the following criteria (Burdett 1979):  0----- no new root growth  1----- some new roots but none over 1 em long  2----- 1-3 new roots over 1 em long  3---- 4-10 new roots over 1 em long  4----- 11-30 new roots over 1 em long  5----- &gt; 30 new roots over 1 em long  Data analysis  Dunnett's single-step multiple comparison procedure using the Student's t statistic  (Dunnett 1955,1964) was first employed to evaluate fertilization effects by comparing the  difference in seedling caliper, height, needle, stem, root and total dry weight, and needle,  stem and root dry weight ratios, and shoot (stem+needle)/root ratio between the nine  fertilization treatments (3 fertilizer products x 3 dosages) and the control using the Type-I  family error rate 0.05. Then two-way classification analysis of variance (ANOVA) was  conducted with the nine fertilization treatments to detect the effect of fertilizer product and  dosage on the aforementioned seedling responses. Pairwise contrasts between fertilizer  products were conducted to rank the three fertilizer products if significant product effect  l  ~,  I  1  1  l  l I  l  4 I  l  l  l J  1 I  I  i I  1 J  l  l I ,  I  r l  r L  r  r  r  r  r  r  r '""  i l  r '  r L r  r  r '-.  r l  r t  .... .........  8  (p&lt;O.l 0) was found by ANOV A. Simple linear regression was used to quantify relationships  between seedling biomass components and fertilizer application rates. Regression of caliper  and height on fertilizer application rates was conducted using a parabolic model of the fonn:  (1)  where Y is the seedling caliper (mm) or height (em), X is the application rate, ao, a1 and a2  are the regression parameters, and & is the random error. The estimated application rate  associated with maximum caliper and height for each fertilizer type was calculated via  differentiation as follows:  estimated application rate = -a• I 2 a2 (2)  Statistical computations aforesaid were perfonned using the PROC GLM ofSAS. Root  growth potential data were analyzed using the PROC FREQ of SAS (SAS® Institute Inc.  1995). For simplicity and convenience in the following sections, we use CTR to represent  the control (no controlled release fertilizer added), and FR-0.8, FR-1.6, and FR-3.2 to  represent the 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 grams per seedling of the FR fertilizer treatments. The  moderate (MR) and slow (SR) release treatments are similarly designated.  Results  Caliper and height growth  Fertilization effect was evident in that most fertilization treatments produced  significantly larger caliper and height (labeled by'+') than the control (Figure 1 ). The MR-  0.8 and SR-0.8 treatments did not differ from the control with respect to seedling caliper.  Similar results were observed for height except that another treatment, SR-3.2, also did not  9  produce significantly larger height than the control. The two-way ANOV A including the  nine fertilization treatments but excluding the control (Table 2) showed no detectable caliper  differences attributable to fertilizer type, application rate or their interaction were found  between fertilization treatments. However, significant fertilizer type effect on height was  detected (p=0.0614) from the same analysis approach. Subsequent contrasts revealed that the  FR fertilizer produced taller seedlings than the MR (p=0.0368) and SR (p=0.0440)  fertilizers. But no statistically significant difference in height was found between the MR  and SR fertilizers. Both caliper and height means of the 1.6 gm rate were the largest among  the three application rates for both the MR. and SR fertilizer types. Based on parabolic  regression results of caliper and height on the application rates for the MR and SR fertilizer  products (Table 3) and calculations from equation (2), the application rates which produced  the maximum caliper and height growth were 2.2 grams for the MR product and 2.0 grams  for the SR product, respectively. Residual analysis showed no detectable pattern when fitting  equation (1) to the data and the lack-of-fit was non-significant. Since all rates of the FR  product produced about the same average caliper and height, we did not estimate a  ""maximum response"" application rate.  Biomass allocation  Fertilization effect on biomass allocation predominately derived from needle production  differences, since five out of nine treatments, i.e., FR-0.8, FR-1.6, Mr-0.8, MR-1.6 and SR-  1.6 produced significantly larger needle dry weight than the controls (Figure 2B). The  average needle dry weight of a seedling for the controls was 0.94 gm while needle weights  ranged from 1.39 to 2.23 gm, 48-137% larger than the controls, for the fertilization  treatments. The average stem dry weight for the controls was 0.58 gm while fertilization  l  l  l ,  J  ]  l  l  l  l I  l  l  l  J  l  ,l \  '  l  ,.,.,  I  ..... i  l  1 )  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  [  r  l  r  r  10  treatments ranged from 0.78 to 1.15 g, 34-98% larger than the controls. However, the stem  dry weight increase was not statistically significant (Figure 2C). Two treatments, FR-0.8 and  MR-1.6, were significantly greater than the controls with respect to root dry weight. Average  root dry weight for the fertilization treatments ranged from 0.81 to 1.22 g, 13-70 % larger  than the control's mean of0.72 g (Figure 2D). Only two fertilization treatments, FR-0.8 and  MR-1.6, produced significantly larger total seedling dry weight than the controls (Figure  2A). At lifting, the average total seedling dry weight ranged from 3.01 to 4.6 g for the  fertilization treatments an increase of 34-104% over the controls (2.25 g). Comparing only  the nine treatments that included fertilizer (not the controls), no significant difference due to  fertilizer type, application rate or their interaction was detected for total dry weight (Table  4).  Fertilizer treatments generally changed biomass allocation among components by  increasing NWR and shoot/root ratio, but decreasing SWR and R WR compared to the  controls (Figure 3). All fertilizer treatments, except for SR-0.8 and SR-1.6, produced  significantly larger NWR than the controls. The NWR for the controls was 42% and  fertilizer treatments ranged from 46 to 53 %(Figure 3A). The FR-1.6, SR-1.6, FR-3.2 and  MR.-3.2 treatments produced significantly lower RWR than the controls. The RWR for the  controls was 31% and ranged from 23 to 28 % for fertilizer treatments (Figure 3C). The MR-  0.8 and SR-3.2 treatments had significantly lower SWR compared to the controls. The SWR  averaged 26% for the controls and ranged from 22 to 26.8% for the fertilizer treatments  (Figure 3B). Only the FR-3.2 fertilizer treatment resulted in significantly larger shoot/root  ratios than the controls. The shoot/root ratio for the controls was 220% and ranged from 260  to 370% for fertilizer treatments (Figure 30).  11  Two-way ANOVA of the nine fertilizer treatments, excluding controls, further revealed  that differences in NWR, RWR and shoot/root ratio were primarily attributable to  application rate, while change in SWR was attributable to both application rate and the  fertilizer type x application rate interaction (Figure 4). Shoot/root ratio and NWR increased  while RWR decreased linearly with application rates for the three fertilizer products. The  relationship between SWR and application rate depended on fertilizer types, since SWR  increased linearly with application rates for the MR fertilizer and decreased with application  rates for the SR fertilizer. No linear relationship existed between SWR and application rate  for the FR fertilizer (Figure 5).  Root growth potential and nutrient release during cold storage  Root growth potential is the capacity for seedlings to initiate new roots under a favorable  environment. After 5 months of cold storage, root growth potential of ponderosa pine  seedlings was related to fertilization treatments, as indicated by the large number of dead  root plugs (root growth potential index =0) for the MR-3.2 and SR-3.2 treatments compared  to the control and all other fertilization treatments (p&lt;0.05). Treatment FR-0.8 produced  more seedlings with root growth potential indexes in categories 4 and 5 than other  treatments; however, the differences were not statistically significant {p=0.05). Treatments  MR-3.2 and SR-3.2 also had significantly lower root growth potential index than other  treatments (Figure 4).  The fertilizer release test showed that nutrients were continuously released from the  fertilizer pellets during cool storage. The amount of nutrients released from 3.2 grams ofMR  and SR fertilizer was 0.295 (9.21%) and 0.142 (4.43%) grams, respectively.  .,  )  J  l  l  l  l '  l  l  ,..,  I  .

Thus caliper and  height of seedlings treated with this fertilizer type were significantly greater than the control.  Treatment FR-0.8 seems best for height growth, while caliper growth did not respond to  higher application rates of this fertilizer, likely due to the additional nutrients leaching out of  the container early in the growing season before they were needed and could be absorbed by  the seedlings.  The MR fertilizer has a 12 to 14-month release period, which is longer than the  greenhouse seedling growth regime. Providing that larger caliper is desirable at lifting, the  0.8 gm per tree rate seems too low since caliper and height were not significantly increased  from this treatment. However, a rate of3.2 gm seems too high given the caliper and height  growth decrease compared to the MR-1.6 treatment.  The SR fertilizer has the longest release period (16 to 20 months) among the three  fertilizers. The slow nutrient release of this product probably caused inadequate nutrients to  be available during the early growth period. The SR-0.8 treatment produced both  insignificant caliper and height growth effects and the SR-3.2 treatment produced an  insignificant height growth effect compared with the control. All these results indicate that  both release rate and application rate should be carefully considered to achieve an optimum  nutrient supply needed to grow larger seedlings with adequate nutrition. In addition, because  of inherently different temporal growth patterns for height and caliper (height growth ceases  13  at bud set in June while caliper growth continues nearly until lifting), the best application  rate for each attribute was different when fertilizer release period was longer than the  seedling production period such as the case for the MR and SR fertilizers. The estimated  best application rates for caliper growth were slightly lower than for height growth. We  suggest that the best application rates should be determined according to caliper growth  because caliper is a better predictor than height in seedling quality assessment (Donald  1991 ). In our experiment, the best application rates for the FR, MR and SR fertilizer were  0.8, 2.2 and 1.9 g per tree respectively to achieve maximum caliper growth.  Biomass allocation  Carbohydrate allocation shifts to shoots under different fertility conditions have been  reported by several researchers (Van Den Driessche 1988, Walker and Huntt 1992, Walker  and Kane 1997). This phenomenon was also observed in our experiment. Most fertilizer  treatments increased seedling needle weight and subsequently NWR and decreased R WR.  However, root dry weight, RWR, SWR, shoot/root ratio and total seedling dry weight were  only influenced by one or two fertilizer treatments. Fertilizer treatment effect on stem dry  weight compared to the controls was not evident. Fertilizer application rate was the most  important factor in our experiment since the highest rate hindered growth and produced  unbalanced biomass allocation between different seedling components. In summary, our  results suggest that controlled-release fertilizers can be used to increase seedling size without  dramatically changing the ratios between individual organs, or combinations of organs, if  fertilizer nutrient release characteristics and application rates are correctly selected.  l  J  l ,  J  l  l J  l  l  1 I  l  I I  ' ,  l  l  l  l  '  '1  !  r  r  r L  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r l  r  r L  r &lt;  r  14  Root growth potential  One problem with incorporating controlled-release fertilizers in container seedling root  plugs is the continuous nutrient release during cold storage. This release subsequently causes  high salinity buildup and toxicity, which in tum causes serious damage to seedling root  systems (Brockley 1988). Results of our root growth potential test confirmed this point. The  MR-3.2 and SR-3.2 treatments caused much lower root growth potential than the same rate  ofFR fertilizer. This result was probably related to longer release periods for the MR and SR  fertilizers. Our release characteristics test of the MR and SR fertilizers during cold storage  supports the idea that continuous nutrient release and subsequent salinity buildup in the root  plug are the major reason for the lower root growth potential. This result suggests that for  MR and SR fertilizers the 3.2 grams per seedling rate is too high. Therefore, given these  small containers, lower application rates and shorter release periods should be used to  prevent root damage when cold storage is required before outplanting. Longer fertilizer  release periods may be appropriate if fall planting is used, thereby avoiding cold storage.  Conclusions  Controlled-release fertilizers significantly increased both caliper and height of ponderosa  pine seedlings. All fertilizer treatments, except for MR-0.8, SR-0.8 and SR-3.2, produced  significantly greater caliper and height than the controls. The dosage to achieve maximum  caliper and height in the greenhouse was 2.2 and 2.3 grams per seedling for MR fertilizer  and 1.9 and 2.0 g per seedling for SR fertilizer, respectively, while for FR fertilizer, the 0.8 g  per seedling rate was best.  15  All treatments, except for FR-3.2, MR-3.2, SR-0.8 and SR-3.2, produced significantly  greater needle dry weight than the controls. However, significant differences in root and total  dry weights were found only for the FR-0.8 and MR-1.6 treatments and the controls.  Fertilization effects on biomass allocation predominately resulted from the increase in  needle dry weights, which in tum caused an increase in needle weight ratio, and the decrease  in root weight ratio. Differences in NWR, RWR, and shoot/root ratio were attributable to  fertilizer application rates alone, while SWR differences were mainly attributable to the  interaction between fertilizer type and application rate. Shoot/root ratio and NWR were  positively related to fertilizer application rates; however, RWR was negatively related to  fertilizer application rates.  The MR-3.2 and SR-3.2 treatments resulted in much lower root growth potential  probably due to toxicity caused by continuous nutrient release during cold storage. Many  dead root plugs were found for these two treatments. The root damage was attributable to  fertilizer type and application rate as well as their interaction. The release period of the fast  release fertilizer better matched the length of the nursery's growing season than longer  release products and it was therefore generally more effective in producing larger seedlings  with well-balanced biomass components.  ,1 _)  l ,  )  l  l  l  l  =]  l  l  l  l &gt;  l -  l  l J  l  i I  j  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  l  r  r  r L  r  r L  r  r  16  Literature cited  Brockley, R.

Shaw  James A. Moore  August 4, 1998  \  Summary  In the fall of 1990, the IFTNC established six fertilization study trials in the  Klickitat area of south central Washington. Three IFTNC members were involved in the  establishment ofthese study trails. Cooperative members include: Champion  Timberlands, Longview Fibre and Washington Dept. ofNatural Resources. The original  fertilization trails were designed to study the effects ofnitrogen (N) and potassium (1&lt;)  fertilization on tree growth and survival. Tree fertilization response (basal area and cubic  volume response over that ofthe controls) was monitored every two years and response  results were summarized. Six-year results showed that periodic volume growth response  for each two-year period since fertilization gradually decreased over time. However,  significant responses were seen on individual sites by parent material types. Examination  ofthe six-year results and re-evaluation oftree nutritional needs in this area prompted the  cooperators to further investigate fertilization response in the Klickitat area with a re­fertilization  ofthe existing 1990 installations.  Work Completed  In late April of 1998, the IFTNC re-fertilized the six 1990 Klickitat installations.  Re-fertilization treatments included aN alone, N plus sulfur (S) and a mixed treatment  consisting ofN, S, boron (B) and copper (Cu). Height and diameter measurements were  taken on all plot trees at the time ofre-fertilization. The weather was warm (70's) and  dry during fertilization. Soils were slightly moist to dry.

The installations were located in predominately Douglas-fir  species composition stands. The plots were grouped into three plots eacht based on tree  and site similarities and by treatment. Installation names, vegetation series, parent  material types and ownership are shown in Table 2. Fertilization treatments for the  original (F/1990) and the re-fertilization (S/1998) applications are listed in Table 3.  Individual plot treatments are listed by installation and are in Appendix A. Nitrogen for  the 1990 application was applied in the urea form and potassium in the murate ofpotash  fonn. Nitrogen for the 1998 application was applied in the urea and ammonium sulfate  formt sulfur in the ammonium sulfate and copper sulfate form, boron as boron FG and  copper in the copper sulfate form.  Measurement of all live plot trees larger than 3 inches in diameter were tallied and  are identified with tags or yellow paint.

The  ponderosa pine trials were located throughout northeastern Oregon and central  Washington and were an expansion of IFTNC Douglas-fir N fertilization trials  established in the early 1980’s. The focus of these fertilization trials was to study  nutrition of commercial forests in the Intermountain Northwest, with the majority of the  effort on studying the effect of N fertilization on growth and survival. In addition,  evidence from IFTNC Douglas-fir trials (Mika and Moore 1990) and other research from  the Inland Northwest suggested that elements other than N, particularly potassium (K),  may also be limiting. In 1987, IFTNC members established 6 additional ponderosa pine  trials in Montana to study the effects of N and K fertilization on tree growth and survival.  This report provides 12 year (1985 sites) and 10 year (1987 sites) final response results  for the ponderosa pine fertilization sites.  METHODS  The ten 1985 and six 1987 ponderosa pine study sites shown in Figure 1 are  located in ecologically diverse areas throughout the Blue Mountains in northeastern  Oregon, east slopes of the Cascade Mountains in central Washington and on west slopes  of the Rocky Mountains in western Montana. Although they are ponderosa pine stands,  they are situated on either Douglas-fir or grand fir habitat series types. The installations  consist of six square 0.1 acre plots surrounded by buffer stripes. Plots were grouped into  blocks of three plots based on tree and site similarities. The three treatments applied in  each of two blocks for the 1985 installations include control, 200 lbs./ac. nitrogen (2N)  and 400 lbs./ac. of nitrogen (4N). Treatments for the 1987 sites include control, 2N and  200 lbs. nitrogen plus 170 lbs./ac. of potassium (NK). Nitrogen was applied in the form  of urea, and K in the form of murate of potash.

Diameter re-measurements are taken every two years  and height re-measurements every four years. Final 12 year (1985 sites) and 10 year  (1987 sites) measurements were taken in the fall of 1997. Installation 297 (Upper Mud  Cr.) was destroyed by wildfire and is not represented in this summary report. Damages  and mortality were noted during re-measurement. Tree volumes were estimated using  regional species-specific volume equations (Wykoff et al. 1982). Detailed stand  characteristics at time of establishment (1985, 1987) and re-measurement summaries are  reported in IFTNC Technical Documentation Report, July, 1998.  For this document, differences in basal area (ft2/ac.) and volume (ft3/ac) growth  response were examined. Analyses included estimation of response on the fertilized plots  relative to control plots. All analyses were run as analysis of variance (GLM) procedures  in the general linear models module of SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 1985). Individual  installation basal area and volume growth response plus statistical models are given in  IFTNC Technical Documentation Report, July, 1998. Average basal area increment to  the fertilizer treatments was adjusted to a common initial basal area of 120 ft2/ac.  Fertilizer growth response was calculated by subtracting the model estimates of growth  on the control plots from the estimates on the fertilized plots.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Basal Area and Volume Growth Response for northeast Oregon and central  Washington:  Twelve-year results for both geographic regions combined show that basal area  per acre response on the 2N and 4N treatments was not significant for the net growth but  was significant for gross (Table 2). Relative net basal area response (growth response on  fertilized plots / growth on control plots) was only 0.5% for the 2N treatment and a  negative 10.0% for the 4N treatment (Table 2). Relative gross basal area response was  was fair with 2N and 4N treatments responding 9.9% and 11.2% over that of the controls,  respectively (Table 2). Twelve-year net and gross cubic volume response was  insignificant, with net volume for both N treatments responding negatively and gross  volume only increasing slightly over that of the controls (Table 3).  The reason for different results between gross and net and the generally low  combined region response may be better explained by looking at the individual region  responses. For instance, there was no significant twelve-year net or gross response over  the controls for either N treatment in northeast Oregon (Tables 4 & 5). In fact, northeast  Oregon net response showed low or highly negative responses for both N treatments.  5  The cause for low net response in northeast Oregon was high mortality. This was  particularly true on plots receiving the 4N treatment where increased mortality could be  attributed to the treatment. Indeed, two northeast Oregon installations suffered moderate  to high mortality (square death) on the plots receiving the 4N treatment. In contrast to  the northeast Oregon sites, central Washington gross basal area and cubic volume  response on the 4N treatment was significantly higher than that of the controls, with  19.7% and 13.8% increases, respectively (Tables 6 & 7). Even though net basal area and  cubic volume response on those plots receiving the 2N treatment was negative or low,  gross response was moderate with 11.3 and 8.2 % increases over that of the controls.

Combined region gross basal area periodic annual increment (PAI) growth  response to the N treatments was significant for the first three growth periods but  insignificant in the fourth period (Table 8). Apparently, the effects of the N treatments  declined during years 7-12. Net basal area PAI response was significant the first period  then generally non-significant for growth periods two, three and four. The reason for the  different results between gross and net basal area growth response is that the fertilized  plots had significantly higher mortality rates, particularly during years 3-4 and 7 to 12  (Table 8).

Differences in response are noticeable between the Douglas-fir  vegetation series and the grand fir vegetation series. Net and gross response was low or  negative for both N treatments on the Douglas-fir types while the grand fir types showed  moderate positive response to both N treatments. The significance of these results is that  all but one of the non-responding Douglas-fir vegetation series types are located in the  northeast Oregon region while all of the responding grand fir types are located in central  Washington. Similarly, net and gross response for both N fertilizer treatments were  different by parent material types (Figure 3). Basalt parent material types showed  negative net basal area response and only a slight gross basal area response to both  fertilizer treatments. Sandstone parent materials types, however, showed positive  response to both fertilizer treatments and significantly so on the 4N treatment with a 17%  increase in response over that of the controls. All of the northeast Oregon sites are  located on negative or low response vegetation / parent material types. We believe  differences in kinds of parent material and vegetation types where our test sites were  located explain the response differences between Oregon and Washington.  -30  -25  -20  -15  -10  -5  0  5  10  15  Basal Area  (sq.ft/a.)

The  treatments were different from the 1985 ponderosa pine trials with the 4N treatment  being replaced with a treatment of 200 pounds per acre of N plus 170 pounds per acre of  K (NK). Other than the treatment difference, the experimental set-up was identical to the  IFTNC Douglas-fir and 1985 ponderosa pine trials.  Average ten-year net and gross results support the potassium hypothesis  developed from the IFTNC Douglas-fir experiment (Mika and Moore 1990). The N  alone treatment showed an average negative net response of 21% compared to control  plot growth, however, when K is added to the fertilizer treatment a 1% response over that  of the controls and a 22% K response over that of the N alone treatment was shown  (Table 9). Gross basal area growth was significant for those plots receiving the NK  treatment with a 10.4% growth increase over control plots and 8.5% K response over N  alone plots (Table 9). Ten-year net and gross volume growth response followed the same  trends as the basal area response (Table 10). Those plots that received the NK treatment  showed a significant gross volume response of 10%. Clearly, this study shows that when  K is added to the fertilizer mix response increases significantly.  -15  -10  -5  0  5  10  15  20  25  Basal Area  (sq.ft/a.)

All three periods show increased net and gross response on the  NK treatment over that of the N alone treatment (Table 11). However, by period 3 (years  5-10) response declined on plots receiving the NK treatment. If N only is applied then  net basal area response is negative. This same response trend can be seen for each period.  Table 11.

NS = Not Significant (p = .10).  Figure 4 shows the ten-year mortality rates by cause for the ponderosa pine sites  in Montana. Nearly all the mortality was caused by mountain pine beetle. This was  especially true on the N alone treatment where mortality was significantly higher than on  the NK treatment. Potassium added to the fertilizer mix lowered bark beetle mortality  rates in the ponderosa pine. Perhaps the beetles were responding to some physiological  or chemical differences in the trees that were fertilized with N only.  10  Net basal response by site and treatment versus pre-treatment foliar K/N ratios are  shown in Figure 5. Based on findings by Ingestad and Lund (1979) the critical foliar K/N  ratio for optimal growth is 0.65 (Figure 5). Values below this level have unbalanced K/N  ratios. The majority of the low or negative (bark beetle mortality) basal area responses  derive from N alone treatments and are associated with those sites that have pre-treatment  foliar K/N ratios below 0.65. Mortality occurred (the large negative responders) when N  alone was added to those sites that had poor K/N balance prior to treatment. Regardless  of the pre-treatment foliar K/N value, when K is added to the fertilizer treatment,  response tends to be positive. Interestingly, all the sites, except installation 303, with pre-treatment  K/N ratios below the 0.65 K/N critical value were grand fir vegetation series  types on sedimentary parent materials (installations 304, 305 and 306). Furthermore, two  of the three low K/N ratio sites showed large differences in response between treatments  (installations 305 and 306). When N alone was applied to these grand fir / sedimentary  types, response was highly negative, however the addition of K to treatment reduced ease  the negative response caused by bark beetle mortality. To further illustrate the K effect,  Figure 6 shows the K net basal area response (K effect) versus foliar K/N ratios on the N  only treated plots. Note that all of the N alone treatment K/N ratios are below the 0.65  recommended level and that net basal area K response clearly decreases as foliar K/N  ratios increase. The installations showing large K response are grand fir vegetation series  types on sedimentary rock types. In fact, three of the top four K responders are located  grand fir / sedimentary types.

Figure 7 shows response for the three vegetation / parent material types present in  Montana. Gross basal area response did not differ significantly between treatments for  the three vegetation and parent material types. Net basal area response, however, did  show negative net basal area response for both treatments on the Douglas-fir / Meta-sedimentary  types. This differed from the Douglas-fir / Sedimentary type which showed a  positive net response to both treatments. The addition of K to the fertilizer treatment did  not appear to make a significant difference, either positively or negatively, on these  vegetation / parent material types. However, the addition of K to the fertilizer treatment  did have a significant effect on the grand fir / sedimentary types, with a significant 42%  K response over the N alone treatment. These results are similar to the results in Figures  5 and 6 in that the grand fir / sedimentary types seem to respond well to the addition of K  to the fertilizer treatment.  CONCLUSIONS  In 1985 the IFTNC established 10 sites in stands dominate to ponderosa pine.  These sites were designed to test the response of two N fertilization treatments (200  lbs./ac. and 400 lbs./ac) in central Washington and northeastern Oregon. Twelve-year  response to the N fertilization in these regions was quite different by vegetation series  and parent material types. Central Washington sites, for instance, showed good N  Figure 7.

Douglas-fir vegetation types and basalt parent material types that we  sampled in Northeast Oregon showed low or negative N response. Negative response  was especially apparent on those plots receiving the 4N treatment where mortality was  high. To fully determine ponderosa pine fertilization response in these regions further  investigations on different vegetation and parent material types need to be completed.  In Montana, IFTNC established an experiment testing the effect of N and N plus  K fertilizers on growth and mortality of ponderosa pine. This experiment provided the  first chance for the IFTNC to test a combined N plus K treatment at the start of an  experiment. After 10 years there were large net growth differences between treatments.  The N only treatment had significantly more mortality than the NK treatment. Potassium  added to the fertilizer mix seemed to reduce mortality. Potassium response was related to  foliar K/N ratios and substantiated the importance of K nutrition for tree growth and  survival. Mortality occurred when N alone was added to those sites with a poor K/N  balance prior to treatment. When K was added to the fertilizer mix, response was  generally positive. Again, as in northeast Oregon and central Washington, site  characteristics such as vegetation and parent material types had a strong effect on  fertilization response. Grand fir vegetation series and sedimentary parent material types  showed the highest response in the Montana region, especially when K was included in  the fertilizer treatment.",North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,,,2016-08-12,2016-08-12,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forestryresearch/id/921,921,922.pdf,/forestryresearch/image/922.pdf,forestryresearch921

Mortality centers cover an estimated 1% of all commercial forests and substantial losses  occur on an additional13% of forest acreage (James et al. 1984). Root diseases are  responsible for a third of the annual mortality in the region (James et al. 1984) and nearly  7 million cubic meters in lost volume (Smith 1984). In Idaho alone, trees growing on  more than 800,000 hectares have been infected by root pathogens (Beckman et al. 1993)  with volume losses estimated at 900,000 cubic meters (Beckman et al. 1993).  The most common root pathogens in the region are Armillaria spp. (Morrison  1981; James et al1984; Wargo and Shaw 1985; Tainter and Baker 1996). Armillaria is  particularly aggressive in western forests, accounting for over a quarter of all tree  mortality (James et al. 1984; Wargo and Shaw 1985; Tainter and Baker 1996). In mixed  fir stands in Oregon, mortality from A. mellea resulted in volume losses of 28 to 104  cubic meters per hectare (Filip and Goheen 1984). Armillaria also causes significant  losses in the volume growth of live trees (Bloomberg and Morrison 1989). In  Southeastern British Columbia, infected Douglas-fir may produce as little as 41% of the  volume produced by uninfected trees.  While Armillaria is capable of infecting all of the region's conifers, species vary  in their susceptibility to the pathogen (Morrison 1981; Entry et al. 1992). Both field and  experimental observations have found Armillaria infection rates to be significantly lower  in western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) than in either ponderosa pine (Pinus  ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) or western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl. ex D. Don)  (Morrison 1981, Entry et al. 1992). Infection rates are highest in Douglas-fir (P.  menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindt.)  (Morrison 1981, Entry et al. 1992). Within species, susceptibility may also vary. Field  observations in stands of Douglas-fir have identified individual trees growing within  mortality centers that appear to be unaffected by the disease.  4  The mechanisms for resistance to Armillaria are not entirely known. However,  several studies have suggested a link between infection rates and variation in root bark  chemistry. Species with higher phenolics:sugar ratios in the root bark tend to be less  susceptible to Armillaria than those with lower ratios (Entry et al. 1991a; Entry et al.  1992). Likewise, within a single species, stands with higher ratios of phenolics to sugars  tend to be less susceptible to disease and insects than stands with low phenolics: sugar  ratios (Wargo 1972; Entry et al. 1991b; Moore et al. 1993; Dudt and Shure 1994; Entry et  al. 1994).  Wargo (1984a) hypothesized that the fungus uses energy gained from  metabolizing sugars in the root tissue to breakdown defense compounds, such as phenols  and tannins. When cultured in media supplemented with the simple sugar, glucose,  Armillaria isolates show increased growth and rhizomorph development (Garraway  1975). However, when phenolic compounds are present in the media, growth is impaired  until a solution with a high sugar concentration is added (Kirk 1981). Entry et al (1991a)  hypothesized that a threshold for successful infection occurs where the energy required to  breakdown defense compounds equals that gained by metabolizing sugars in the root  tissue. Similar hypotheses have been advanced to explain insect and bear preferences in  oak and Douglas-fir stands (Feeny 1970; Kimball et al. 1997).  5  If variation in root bark chemistry is indeed linked to Armillaria susceptibility and  it is at least partially controlled by genetics, it may be possible to decrease susceptibility  in species like Douglas-fir by selectively breeding for high phenolics:sugar ratios. The  objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether differences in root bark chemistry,  in particular differences in the phenolics:sugar ratio, are genetically controlled in  Douglas-fir, (2) to examine the relationship between height growth and root bark  chemistry, and (3) to identify families with both superior height growth and high  phenolics:sugar ratios.  METHODS  Site Descriptions  Two Inland Empire Tree Improvement Cooperative (IETIC) Douglas-fir progeny  tests were sampled in this study. Both are located in northern Idaho in the mid-elevation  (915 to 1219 m) breeding zone for Douglas-fir. The Rimrock test (lat.48°26' N; long.  116°47' W) is located near the Priest River Experimental Forest, southeast of Coolin, ID  (Fins and Rust 1997). It has an average elevation of 1143 m and a west to northwest  aspect. Prior to planting, Rimrock was mechanically windrowed. The Busse) Creek test  (lat. 47°05' N; long. 116°09' W) is located northeast of Clarkia, ID on land managed by  the Potlatch Corporation. It has an average elevation of 1189 m and a southern aspect.  Prior to planting, Busse) Creek was broadcast-burned. In addition to geographic  similarities, both progeny tests are on Thuja plicata-Pachistima myrsinites habitat types  (Daubenrnire and Daubenrnire 1968).  6  Rimrock and Bussel Creek were established as sister tests to evaluate long-term  progeny field performance. A third sister test was also established but with the exception  of 12-yr height measurements, it is not included in this study. Each site contains the  progeny of260 families from eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana.  In 1981, 1-yr-old container seedlings were planted in the tests at 1.5m x 1.5m spacing.  Families were randomly assigned to one of five sets. Family members were distributed  in 3 blocks, each containing randomized, non-contiguous, 9-tree plots, (27 test trees per  family per site) (Fins 1983). We use the term ""family'' to refer to progeny of a single,  open-pollinated parent tree. Parent trees were woods-run Douglas-fir, selected in 1979  based on superior growth and form characteristics. Set 1, which included 59 families,  was selected for use in this study as it had high survival (90%) and relatively low damage  (14%) across the three test sites compared to families in the other sets. The twenty  families that were included in this study had also been previously sampled for an IETIC  study relating foliar nutrient concentrations and height growth (Walker 1995).  Root Bark Samples  Samples of inner root bark tissue were collected from 5 to 11 members of each  family at each site. A balanced design was not possible due to mortality in the progeny  tests prior to sampling. Samples were collected during the first three days of October  1993 at Bussel Creek and from late September to early October 1994 at Rimrock. The  root collar of each sampled tree was uncovered until two roots with a minimum diameter  7  of 1.27 em were exposed. Then, a 3.81-cm x 7.62-cm rectangular section of inner root  bark tissue was removed from each root. Samples were taken approximately 20.32 em to  30.48 em below the root collar and, wherever possible, from opposite sides of the tree.  When only smaller {&lt;1.27 em diameter) roots were uncovered, two roots were clipped  and sections of bark comparable in size to the chiseled samples were peeled from the  roots. For 2 trees, only one root large enough to provide a sample was found so samples  were taken from opposite sides of the same root. Samples were transported from the field  in coolers and stored at -15° Cat the University ofldaho, College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences in Moscow, ID until April1995. Samples were then divided into  two batches to facilitate laboratory schedules and submitted for analysis to the Institute of  Biological Chemistry at Washington State University in Pullman, WA. The first set of  samples was analyzed in December 1995; the second in August 1996.  Samples were freeze-dried and ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle.  Sugar and starch concentrations were determined using the methods of Hansen and  Moller (1975). Ethanol percolation and anthrone solution were used to extract sugar  from the samples and ethanol and perchloric acid percolation were used to extract starch.  Absorbances at 630nm were recorded and compared to standard curves produced with a  glucose standard solution. Because pectin and other polymers are extracted by the  ethanoVperchloric acid method (Marshall1986, Rose et. al1991, Shaw et al. 1998),  starch values were adjusted as described in Marshall (1986). The adjusted starch  concentration values are reported in this paper. Protein-precipitable tannins were  extracted from the tissue samples using 80% aqueous acetone (Hagerman 1987).  Concentrations were determined by comparing diffusion rings measured on an agarose  plate containing bovine serum albumin to a standard curve established with tannic acid  (Sigma). Phenols were extracted with Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and 80% aqueous  acetone solution according to the methods ofJulkunen-Tiitto (1985). Absorbances  measured at 735 nm were compared to a standard curve established with phenol to  determine phenol concentrations in the samples.  Growth and Form Measurements  Four surveys of damage sustained by trees in the two tests were conducted  between test establishment and sample collection. In 1982 and 1984, the presence or  absence of damage was recorded for each tree and damage was categorized as resulting  from rodents, large animals, insects, physical factors, or unknown causes. In 1989 and  1992, the presence or absence of terminal damage was also recorded for each tree. In  1992, total tree height was measured at the three sister tests. These values were used to  calculate the percentile height rankings for each family.  Statistical Analyses  8  A randomized block design was used to compare the root bark chemistry of 20  families growing in 2 progeny test sites. A statistical model containing family, site, and  the family x site interaction terms was used to estimate genetic and environmental effects  on root bark chemistry. To account for uneven sample sizes (5 to 11 trees per family per  site), a general linear model analysis ofvariance (PROC GLM; SAS Institute 1990b) was  used to identify significant sources of variation in the individual root compounds (sugar,  starch, tannins, and phenolics) and in the phenolics:sugar ratio. Family and site mean  9  phenolics:sugar ratios were calculated using the PROC MEANS procedure of SAS (SAS  Institute 1990a). Spearman correlation coefficients and genetic correlations were  calculated for sugar, starch, tannins, phenolics and total height using PROC CORR (SAS  Institute 1990a). Since damage to a tree can cause an increase in the production of  defense compounds (Shrimpton 1972; Vance et al. 1980), Spearman correlations between  the root bark compounds and the different measures of damage were also calculated.  Phenotypic (V p) and additive genetic variances (Va) were estimated for sugar,  starch, protein-precipitable tannins, phenolics and the phenolics: sugar ratio using PROC  V ARCOMP (SAS Institute 1990b). Family and single-tree narrow-sense heritabilities  were estimated for each of the root bark compounds, the phenolics:sugar ratio and 12-  year height growth using equations adapted from those in Zobel and Talbert (1991) for  estimating heritability in half-sib tests. The adapted equations are as follows:  Single-tree narrow-sense heritability= 4cr2  where cr2 r = variation due to family  cr2  5 = variation due to site  2 2 2 2 cr e + cr fxs + cr s + cr f  cr2  rxs = variation due to the family x site interaction  cr2  e =variation due to trees within the plots (sampling error)  n1 =number of trees per family per site  n2 = number of trees per family per site x number of sites  Variance components and coefficients for the family and single-tree narrow-sense  [Eq. 1]  [Eq. 2]  heritability estimates were calculated using PROC V ARCOMP (SAS Institute 1990b).  Because the progeny tests used in this study contain open pollinated families, they are not  true half-sib tests. Some of the progeny within the families may be full-sibs or even the  result of self-pollinations. Thus, the estimates of heritability and additive genetic  variance are likely to be somewhat inflated.  RESULTS  Root Bark Chemistry  10  Site means differed only slightly between the two progeny tests for each root bark  compound and for the phenolics:sugar ratio (Table l ); however, the range of values  differed at the two sites. Sugar and tannin concentrations varied more at Bussel Creek  while starch and phenolics concentrations varied more at Rimrock. Family means  displayed by site show the variation between families and sites as well as the family x site  interaction (Figure 1 ). Root chemical compound concentrations were not consistently  higher at either site.  Analyses of variance results showed that concentrations of sugar, starch, protein­precipitable  tannins and phenolics and the phenolics:sugar ratios were significantly  different between sites and families (Table 2). There was also a significant interaction  between family and site for each of the compounds and for the phenolics:sugar ratio.  Variance and Heritability  Variation in starch concentration was large and resulted in negative estimates of  the family variance component. As is customary, the family variance estimate was  replaced with 0. This caused the additive genetic variance and the heritability estimates  for starch to be 0 (Tables 3 and 4). Estimates ofVa for the other compounds ranged from  0.0404 g2 for tannins to 5.5756 g2 for phenolics.  Both family and single-tree narrow-sense heritabilities were estimated from the  mean squares variance components generated by SAS. Sugar concentrations had the  highest heritabilities, with genetic variation accounting for approximately 60% of the  total variation (Table 4). Family and single-tree narrow-sense heritability estimates for  the phenolics:sugar ratios were moderate and genetic variation accounted for about 20-  25% of the total variation in the ratio. Heritability estimates for 12-yr height (based on  undamaged trees only) were 0.54 for single-tree heritability and 0.62 for family  heritability.  Correlations between Root Bark Chemistry and Height Growth  II  Genetic correlation estimates between the root bark compounds and 12-yr height  growth are provided in Table 5. Height was weakly but significantly correlated with  tannin and phenolic concentrations (0.12 and 0.11 respectively) but not with sugar, starch  or the phenolics:sugar ratio. Sugar and starch were significantly correlated with tannins,  phenolics and the phenolics:sugar ratio but not with each other. Tannins and phenolics  were significantly correlated with each other and with the phenolics:sugar ratio.  None of the root bark compounds were correlated with damage (Table 6).  However, height was weakly but negatively correlated with physical and rodent damage  and with the two measurements of terminal damage (-0.15, -0.11,-0.21 and -0.11,  respectively).  Although the correlation between height and the phenolics:sugar ratio was not  significant, there were families with both superior height growth and above average  phenolics:sugar ratios at each progeny test. Three families in the top thirtieth percentile  12  for height growth are located in the upper right quadrant of Figure 2, and thus have above  average ratios at both test sites.  DISCUSSION  The concentrations of sugar, starch, protein-precipitable tannins and phenolics  showed significant genetic and environmental variation as did the phenolics:sugar ratio.  The range of phenolics: sugar ratios observed at the two progeny test sites span the ratios  reported for unthinned Douglas-fir stands (mean of 10.32) as well as for thinned and  fertilized stands (mean of 5.73) (Entry et al.l991b). In the study by Entry et al. (199lb),  unthinned stands ofDouglas-frr had lower mean phenolics:sugar ratios than thinned  stands (17.19) and were more susceptible to A. ostoyae (Romagn.) Herink infection.  Stands that were thinned and fertilized had the lowest mean ratios and were the most  susceptible to infection. In our study, the site mean phenolics:sugar ratios (5.3604 at  Bussel Creek and 4.8496 at Rimrock) were lower than the stand means observed by Entry  et al.(l99lb). Foliar nutrient data suggest that the site means may be low as a result of  nutrient deficiencies1  • Over 75% of the trees sampled at Bussel Creek had foliar N levels  below those considered adequate for Douglas-fir in the Inland Northwest (Garrison and  Moore 1998). Entry et al. (1991a) found that trees grown with limited N tend to have  lower phenolics:sugar ratios than trees grown with adequate amounts ofN.  Differences in the phenolics: sugar ratio between the sites in this study were small  and may have been influenced by sampling year. Because samples were collected from  the two sites in different years, site differences cannot be separated from yearly  1 data on file with the Inland Empire Tree Improvement Cooperative at the University of  Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843  13  differences in this study. It is interesting to note however that for each compound, some  families had higher mean values at Bussel Creek while others had higher mean values at  Rimrock. The family x site interaction, which is relatively large, may also have been  influenced by differences in sampling year.  There were several significant correlations between root bark compounds. As  expected, sugar is negatively correlated with the phenolics:sugar ratio while phenolics are  positively correlated with the ratio. The correlations between starch and phenolics or  tannins (plant defense compounds) were negative, which could indicate competition for  available carbon. According to Herms and Mattson ( 1992), there may be trade-offs  between defense compounds and storage carbohydrates when resources, such as  nutrients, are limited. Foliar nutrient analyses at the Bussel Creek site suggest that  nutrients are extremely limited and that the majority of trees growing in the test may  suffer from nutrient deficiencies2  •  Height was weakly but positively correlated with both tannins and phenolics,  which appears to contradict traditional hypotheses regarding carbon allocation (Herms  and Mattson 1992). Several other studies have found similar positive relationships  between growth and defense compounds as well (Denslow et al. 1987; Briggs and  Schultz 1990; Denslow et al. 1990; Kimball et al.1999). One explanation for this result is  that nutrient deficiencies present at the progeny test sites are limiting growth so carbon is  available for phenol and tannin production. Studies have shown that this carbon  allocation pattern can occur without noticeable growth impact when environmental  resources limit growth (Bryant et al. 1985; Mihaliak and Lincoln 1985; Larsson et al.  2 data on file with the Inland Empire Tree Improvement Cooperative at the University of  Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843  1986; Mihaliak and Lincoln 1989). However, when adequate resources are available,  carbon allocation shifts towards growth and little carbon is available for defense  compounds (Bazzaz et al. 1987).  14  Height and the phenolics:sugar ratio were not correlated. However, it was  possible to identify families with both superior height growth and above average  phenolics:sugar ratios at the 2 test sites. The heritability analysis suggests that it would  be possible to select for both traits in Douglas-fir. Heritability estimates were high for  12-yr height growth (0.54 for single-tree heritability and 0.62 for family heritability).  These values are higher than heritability estimates based on 8-yr height growth in the  same 20 families (0.27 and 0.54, respectively) (Walker 1995). This narrow-sense  heritability estimate is consistent with those reported by Campbell (1972) for height in  coastal Douglas-fir. Heritability estimates were moderate for the phenolics: sugar ratio  (0.20 and 0.24). However, they were high for sugar (0.64 and 0.59). As the single-tree  narrow-sense heritabilities indicate, the proportion ofVp explained by Va is much higher  for sugar than for the phenolics:sugar ratio. This implies that greater gains would be  made by selecting for low sugar concentrations rather than directly selecting for higher  phenolics:sugar ratios or high phenolics concentrations.  Wargo (1980, 1981) found that when glucose concentrations are low, defense  compounds such as phenols and tannins inhibit fungal growth and can be toxic to  Armillaria. However, when glucose concentrations are high, Armillaria is capable of  oxidizing defense compounds and using them as a carbon source (Wargo 1980, 1981,  1984b; Cheo 1982). Gallic acid and gallotannin have both been shown to stimulate the  fungus when glucose levels are high (Wargo 1980, 1984b; Cheo 1982). The genetic  correlations estimated in this study indicate that selecting for low sugar will have a  positive effect on the phenolics:sugar ratio but will not have a significant effect on tree  height. Thus, sugar concentrations may be the key component of the phenolics:sugar  ratio and selection on sugar concentration could decrease susceptibility to Armillaria sp.  without sacrificing superior growth characteristics.  CONCLUSIONS  15  Significant genetic and environmental influences on root bark chemistry were  identified in this study. Family, site and the family x site interaction had significant  effects on the individual compounds measured. Family and single-tree narrow-sense  heritability estimates indicate that genetic differences account for 20-24% of the variation  in the phenolics:sugar ratio. Although height was not correlated with the phenolics:sugar  ratio, three families with height rankings above the seventieth percentile had above  average ratios at both of the test sites. Heritabilities for sugar were much higher than for  phenolics or the phenolics:sugar ratio, suggesting greater gains could be made by  selecting for low sugar concentration rather than for high phenolics:sugar ratios. Since  sugar concentration was not significantly correlated with height, selection for low sugar  could increase the phenolics:sugar ratio without having a negative effect on total tree  height.

"The Effect of Nitrogen Fertilization, Rock Type, and Habitat Type on Individual Tree Mortality","Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.","An individual tree mortality model for nitrogen fertilized Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco) stands was developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the inland Northwest. The proposed linear logistic model included the following independent variables: a dummy variable for the two habitat types, a set of dummy variables for the five rock types, a set of dummy variables for the three N fertilizer treatments, diameter at breast height, crown ratio, and crown competition factor. The results show that N fertilization, rock type, and habitat type significantly affect individual tree mortality. The probabilities of tree mortality on fertilized plots were greater than those on control plots and increased with increasing N fertilizer application  rates. Trees growing on granitic and metasedimentary rocks had lower foliar potassium concentration and exhibited greater probabilities of mortality than did those growing on other rocks. The probabilities of mortality for trees growing on sedimentary rocks were very low. Moist sites had lower soil fertility and produced higher mortality rates than dry sites. Furthermore, the N fertilization response ratio, defined as the annual mortality probability of a fertilized tree over the annual mortality probability of a unfertilized tree with identical tree and stand characteristics, was estimated based on the mortality model. The response ratios were nearly constant (about 1.4) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 224 kg N treatment. The response ratios were also nearly constant (about 2.1) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 448 kg N treatment. Finally, the mortality prediction model passed a validation test on independent data not used in model development.",2000-07-28,,research (document genres); data modeling; fertilizer; statistics;,"Shen, G., J.A.

Cette  étude quantitative démontre que les relations de compétition entre arbres individuels sont affectées de façon significa-tive  par le type de roche. Les types de roche s’avèrent utiles pour représenter de fortes différences dans  l’environnement nutritif d’un site.

[Traduit par la Rédaction] Shen et al. 623  Introduction  Interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca  (Beissn.) Franco) is important in a wide range of forest types  for a wide array of nontimber values and also plays a critical  role in local and regional economies as a raw material for  wood and paper products in the Inland Northwest. There-fore,  forest managers apply intermediate silvicultural treat-ments,  such as cleaning, thinning, and fertilization, to  Douglas-fir stands to achieve specific management goals.  In the Inland Northwest, forest fertilization research began  in the early 1960s (Loewenstein and Pitkin 1963, 1971).  Early work focused on growth response of grand fir (Abies  grandis (Dougl.) Lindl.) and Douglas-fir stands to thinning  and nitrogen fertilization in northern Idaho (Olson 1981;  Scanlin and Loewenstein 1981; Shafii et al.1989).  Considerable research (Shafii et al.1989, 1990; Mika and  Moore 1990; Stage et al. 1990; Mika and Vander Ploeg  1991; Moore et al. 1991, 1994; Mika et al. 1992; Mital  1995; Avila 1997) has shown that nitrogen fertilization can  significantly increase basal area or volume growth. Larger  trees in a stand showed greater diameter growth response to  nitrogen fertilization than smaller trees, and individual trees  in low-density stands exhibited more fertilization response  than those growing in high-density stands (Shafii et al.  1990). Furthermore, rock type proved to be an important  factor affecting stand-level growth response to N fertiliza-tion  (Mika et al. 1992; Mital 1995). Forest habitat type  (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968) and rock type are now  used to guide operational fertilization programs in the region  (Moore et al. 1998).  In forest management planning, growth simulators are  used for predicting the development of forest growth and  yield. To forecast growth reliably for fertilized stands,  Can. J. For.

Recent examples of model-ing  the effect of fertilization on stand-level yield prediction  are provided by Ballard (1984), Lowell (1988), and Bailey  et al. (1989). At present, growth in most simulators is pre-dicted  using individual tree models. Thus, there is a continu-ing  need to model growth response to fertilization at the tree  level. Such an example was provided by Shafii et al. (1990),  Stage et al. (1990), and Hynynen (1993). However, there are  no published individual tree basal area growth models that  relate fertilization response to habitat type, rock type, stand  attributes, and tree attributes and that are compatible with  growth simulation models used in the region (Wykoff et al.  1982). Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to  develop an individual tree basal area growth model to quan-tify  the effect of basal area response to nitrogen fertilization  and assess habitat type and rock type effects on growth re-sponse.  Since an accurate and precise model is critical for  this assessment, efforts should be made to deal with issues  surrounding model development appropriately, particularly  collinearity (Belsley et al. 1980) and correlated errors.  Materials and methods  Data  Data used in this study was obtained from Intermountain Forest  Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) study sites. The study area in-cludes  six geographic regions: northern Idaho, western Montana,  central Idaho, northeastern Oregon, central Washington, and north-eastern  Washington. From 1980 to 1982, the IFTNC established a  total of 94 fertilizer trials (installations) throughout the six regions.  Installations were located in second-growth, even-aged, man-aged  Douglas-fir stands. Most stands had been thinned 5–years  prior to plot establishment; a few stands were unthinned, but natu-rally  well spaced. Stands were selected to represent a range of  stand density, tree age and size, and site productivity. The stands  were dominated by Douglas-fir and included ponderosa pine  (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.), lodgepole pine (Pinus  contorta Dougl. ex Loud.), western larch (Larix occidentalis  Nutt.), and grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl.) Lindl.).  Each installation contained six square plots ranging from 0.04 to  0.08 ha in size. The plot size was determined based on average tree  size and stand density so that each plot contains at least 10  Douglas-fir sample trees. The plots were selected to minimize  among-plot variation in terrain, vegetation composition, tree stock-ing,  and tree size. Plots were grouped into two blocks of three  plots based on similarity of these features to further reduce varia-tion.  Three fertilizer treatments (0, 224, and 448 kg/ha of nitrogen)  were randomly assigned to the plots within each block. Nitrogen in  the form of urea was applied in the late fall utilizing hand-held  spreaders. After 6 years, a variable number of plots were retreated  at each installation. However, trees from these retreated plots are  not included in the current analysis.  All live trees were measured for both height (to the nearest  0.03 m) and diameter (to the nearest 0.025 cm) at the time of the  first treatment. For the first 10 years after plot establishment, diam-eters  were remeasured on all trees every 2 years, and any incidence  of damage or mortality along with probable cause was noted. Only  trees alive at the end of the 10-year period, a total of 5065  Douglas-fir trees located on 257 plots across 94 installations, were  used in this analysis. Thus, each tree had an observed 10-year  growth period. Habitat was determined on site for each plot, and  each plot was assigned to one of five habitat type categories: grand  fir, dry Douglas-fir, moist Douglas-fir, western redcedar (Thuja  plicata Donn ex D. Don), and western hemlock (Tsuga hetero-phylla  (Raf.) Sarg.). Since there were limited observations within  selected habitat types on some rock types, in our analysis habitat  type is specified at two levels: moist including grand fir, moist  Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock habitat types  and dry including dry Douglas-fir habitat types. Moist Douglas-fir  types occur in a region of north-central Washington where grand  fir is completely absent in its geographic distribution. Thus, there  can be no sites classified as grand fir habitat types in this geo-graphic  subregion (Williams and Lillybridge 1983). The moist  Douglas-fir sites in our study are similar to grand fir types else-where,  and we included them in the moist site category in our anal-ysis.  Rock samples were collected at each location and, after  examination by a geologist, each installation was assigned to one  of five rock type categories: granite, basalt, metasediment, sedi-ment,  and mixed – glacial till. Individual tree records were edited  for species codes, diameter at breast height, crown class codes,  condition codes, crown ratio, and height, and individual plot re-cords  were edited for habitat type codes, rock type codes, treat-ment  codes, slope, aspect, elevation, stand age, and Douglas-fir  site index (Monserud 1984). Distribution of plots and distribution  of Douglas-fir trees by habitat type, rock type, and treatment at the  beginning of the 10-year growth period are provided in Table 1.  Selected stand and tree attributes are summarized in Table 2.  Analysis  Basal area increment model  Model development in our study was based both on biological  and statistical considerations as follows.  The natural logarithm of 10-year periodic change in squared di-ameter,  ln(DDS), was the dependent variable in the individual-tree  basal area increment model for consistency with models in the for-est  vegetation simulator (FVS) (Stage 1973; Wykoff et al. 1982).  [1] DDS = DIB102 – DIB2  where DDS is the 10-year periodic growth in squared diameter at  breast height, in square inches (1 in.2 = 6.4516 cm2); DIB10 is the  inside bark diameter at breast height 10 years after treatment, in  inches (1 in. = 2.54 cm); and DIB is the inside bark diameter at  breast height at the beginning of the growth period, in inches.  Clearly, the growth rates of trees within a plot were spatially corre-lated.  Because spatial information from mapped tree locations  within a plot was not available, a mixed linear model containing  both fixed-effects parameters and random-effects parameters with  the compound-symmetry covariance structure suggested and em-ployed  by Hökkä and Groot (1999) was used to account for the  correlated errors among trees within plots. Thus, the basal area in-crement  model was specified as follows:  [2] ln(DDSij) = b0 + SITEi + SIZEij + COMPij + ui  + eij, i = 1, 2, …, 257; j = 1, 2, …, ni  where  [3] SITEi = b1HBi + bk ki  k  2  1  4  RC  = å  + bp pi  p  3  1  2  TT  = å  + b4(SLi/100)[sin(ASPi)] + b5(SLi/100)  ´ [cos(ASPi)] + b6(ELi/10 000)2  [4] SIZEij = b7 ln(DBHij)  © 2000 NRC Canada  614 Can.

The model assumed the growth obser-vations  of trees from the same stand to be correlated and all ran-dom  parameters to follow independent multivariate normal  distributions with zero means and constant variances and  covariances at each level. All the model parameters were estimated  simultaneously with the maximum likelihood estimation method  using the PROC MIXED procedure on the SAS/STAT software  (SAS Institute Inc. 1996).  In the combined site effect (eq. 3), habitat type (HAB) is a land  classification based on expected climax vegetation (Daubenmire  and Daubenmire 1968) and could represent a variety of moisture  regimes. Thus, a dummy variable HB representing habitat effects  was included in the increment model. Because rock type (ROC)  has been shown to be an important factor affecting stand-level  growth response to N fertilization (Moore et al. 1998) and could  represent differences in the forest nutritional environment, a set of  dummy variables RC representing rock effects were included in the  model. Fertilizer treatment (TRT) can raise site productivity by  adding readily available sources of nutrients to increase a site’s nu-trient  capital. Thus, a set of dummy variables TT representing  treatment effects were added to the increment model. Slope (SL)  and aspect (ASP) effects on tree growth were based on Stage’s  (1976) transformation modified by exclusion of the SL term, be-cause  it was not statistically significant. Although not significant,  the (SL/100)(sin(ASP)) term was retained in the increment model,  because the (SL/100)(cos(ASP)) term was significant. Stage (1976)  recommends including both terms in the model even though one is  statistically nonsignificant because doing so allows circular optima  with respect to both slope and aspect to be expressed.  In the combined competition effect (eq. 5), tree crown ratio  (CR) is a measure of foliage quantity indicative of tree vigor and is  thus an important factor affecting tree growth. Although greatly  dependent on tree vigor, the growth attained by an individual tree  is also conditioned by competition with other trees for scarce re-sources.  Overall stand density effects were represented in the in-crement  model by the number of trees per acre (TPA).  Furthermore, the growth attained by an individual tree is also de-pendent  on its competitive status relative to neighboring trees. The  ratio of a tree’s total height to average height of dominant and  codominant trees (RHD) is a measure of relative tree size with re-spect  to the vertical position of a tree within the population.  Daniels et al. (1986) demonstrated a correlation of RHD with indi-vidual  tree growth. As a measure of the social cross-sectional rank-ing  of a tree within the population, basal area in larger trees (BAL)  behaves well under all types of thinnings (Wykoff 1990). The inter-action  terms: (RHD/100)/ln(DBH + 1) and (BAL/100)/ln(DBH + 1)  instead of RHD and BAL, respectively, were included in the incre-ment  model to allow the effect of relative size to vary with changes  in the distribution of diameters.  We were particularly interested in the effects of rock and habitat  types on the pattern of within-stand distribution of fertilization  growth response. Thus, we tested interaction terms of HAB ×  ROC × TRT with variables representing tree size or competitive ef-fects  in the model (eq. 2). We also tested lower order interactions  of these variables. The interaction between (BAL/100)/ln(DBH +  1) and HAB × ROC × TRT was included in the increment model,  because this term showed high statistical significance and weak  collinearity (Belsley et al. 1980). Although other highest order in-teraction  terms and some lower order interaction terms were also  statistically significant, none of these terms was included in the in-crement  model because their inclusion resulted in a substantial in-crease  in collinearity statistics.  Fertilization response estimation  To quantify an individual tree’s response to nitrogen fertiliza-tion,  the response ratio (R) (Stage et al. 1990) for basal area  increment is defined as  [6] Rp p  = p =  exp{[ln( )] }  exp{[ln( )] }  ,  DDS  DDS  or  0  1 2  where R1 is the response ratio for the 224 kg N/ha treatment, R2 is  the response ratio for the 448 kg N/ha treatment, [ln(DDS)]1 is the  predicted value from the growth model with the 224 kg N/ha treat-ment,  [ln(DDS)]2 is the predicted value from the growth model  with the 448 kg N/ha treatment, and [ln(DDS)]0 is the predicted  value from the growth model with no treatment. Like a multiplier  (Hamilton 1994), R measures relative basal area growth response  to fertilization compared with a no-treatment alternative. When R  is equal to 1, there is no growth response to fertilization; when R is  greater than 1, there is positive growth response to fertilization;  when R is less than 1, there is negative growth response to fertil-ization.  However, it should be noted that higher relative response  does not necessarily translate into higher absolute basal area  growth. Absolute basal area growth depends on R and basal area  growth under the no-treatment alternative as well.  Because the dependent variable in the growth model was the  logarithmic transformation of DDS, predicted values of DDS based  on the model were corrected using a correction factor suggested by  Flewelling and Pienaar (1981) and employed by Hökkä and Groot  (1999). The estimate of the logarithmic transformation of response  to fertilization in eq. 6 was expressed as the ratio between the esti-mate  of basal area increment for a fertilized tree and the estimate  for an unfertilized tree. When this ratio is computed, variables in  the increment model that do not interact with treatment sum to  zero. The only remaining variable that interacted with the fertiliza-tion  treatment is the (BAL/100)/ln(DBH + 1) term. The resultant  response model is therefore given by  [7] ln( )  ( / )  ln( )  R c ,  c  p p p  = + p  +  0 =  1 100  1  1 2  BAL  DBH  or  where p = 1 for the 224 kg N/ha treatment or 2 for the 448 kg N/ha  treatment, R1 and R2 are as described in eq. 6, BAL and DBH are  as previously defined, and the values of c01 and c02 are the esti-mates  of the parameters b31 and b32 in eq. 2, and the value of c1p is  the difference between the estimates of the parameters d1rt in the  growth model (eq. 2) for treatment p and control by rock type on  moist sites.

Comparing this value with c2 distribution with  one degree of freedom yields a p value less than 0.0001. This  indicates that modeling the random stand effect is superior to  fitting the model with only the fixed effects and the random  error. The residual plots from the increment model (eq. 2)  using the maximum-likelihood estimates did not show any  objectional trends and did not suggest any problems with the  assumptions made in fitting the model.

With the exception of the sedimentary rock type,  448 kg/ha of nitrogen produced greater relative response  than the 224 kg N/ha treatment. All responses were signifi-cantly  different than the null hypothesis that R = 1. On dry  sites or on granite rocks, the average response ratios for the  224 and 448 kg N /ha treatments are 1.104 29 and 1.172 39,  respectively.  Discussion  The results of this study are directly useful for quantifying  nitrogen fertilizer response of individual Douglas-fir trees in  the region. Equation 2 is compatible with individual tree  growth simulation models, such as FVS (Wykoff et al.  1982), commonly used to forecast growth and yield in the  Inland Northwest. In fact, our study substantially expands  the work of Stage et al. (1990) by providing fertilization re-sponse  estimates for various habitat type and rock type com-binations.  Alternatively, the parameters provided in Table 6  could be used as crude individual tree N fertilization re-sponse  growth multipliers by those who do not use individ-ual  tree simulation models formulated similar to the FVS  model.  Perhaps the most interesting results of our study are the  quantitative insights into individual tree competitive rela-tionships  across a variety of moisture (i.e., habitat types) and  mineral nutrient (i.e., rock types) environments. These in-sights  were developed by evaluating the tree growth (eq. 2)  and the response ratio (eq. 7) for three nitrogen treatment  levels (control, 224 kg N/ha, and 448 kg N/ha), two habitat  types (moist and dry), and five rock types (granite, basalt,  metasedimentary, sedimentary, and mixed) across a range of  tree diameters from 3 to 30 inches (7.62–76.20 cm) and  BAL from 0 to 300 ft2/ac (0–68.87 m2/ha) with the values of  other independent variables being held constant at their  means. In the interest of brevity, only selected combinations  are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.  As expected, large dominant trees (i.e., those with low  BAL) growing on moist sites show the greatest absolute  growth over a 10-year period (Fig. 1). However, the effect of  nitrogen fertilization on stand dynamics, i.e., within-stand  distribution of fertilizer response, for different rock and  treatment types on moist sites is better demonstrated by rela-tive  growth (Fig. 2).  Moist habitats produced relatively greater response than  dry habitats across all rock types except granite rocks and  metasedimentary rocks with the 224 kg N/ha treatment. In  addition, the shape of response surfaces, i.e., the relative dis-tribution  of response between individual trees within stands,  differs between moist and dry habitats. On moist sites the re-sponse  surface is upward sweeping; trees of small diameter  with high BAL produced higher relative fertilization re-sponse  than large diameter trees with low BAL. The only  exception to this response pattern for moist sites occurred  for stands growing on granite rocks and metasedimentary  rocks with the 224 kg N/ha treatment. The shape of the re-sponse  surface for metasedimentary rocks was slightly  downward sloping. Small trees with high BAL produced rel-atively  less fertilization response than large trees with low  BAL growing in the same stand (Fig. 2). Although not  shown, response surfaces for the 448 kg N/ha treatment  were flat and similar to those for the 224 kg N/ha treatment,  with somewhat higher relative response on granite rocks or  on dry sites. Soils derived from granite rocks can be some-what  infertile with respect to nutrients other than N. Perhaps  more importantly, soils derived from granite rocks have a  sandy texture with low moisture holding capacity and low  cation exchange capacity. Thus, Douglas-fir growing on  granite sites behave similarly to dry sites with respect to N  fertilization response.  On moist sites, trees growing in subordinate crown posi-tions,  those of small diameter with high BAL (i.e., sup-pressed),  produced larger relative response to N fertilization  than did large diameter trees with low BAL (i.e.,  dominants). This suggests that competition for N was partic-ularly  acute for the suppressed trees, since they exhibited the  greatest relative response when additional N was supplied  by fertilization. However, this response pattern was only evi-dent  on moist sites (Fig. 2). After N deficiency was allevi-ated  by fertilization, suppressed trees on moist sites  apparently had sufficient moisture available to allow these  trees to increase their growth rate in response to increased N  availability. On drier sites, lack of moisture likely inhibited  fertilization growth response by the suppressed trees. These  response patterns suggest that N fertilization would have  © 2000 NRC Canada  Shen et al. 619  224 kg N/ha 448 kg N/ha  Rock type c11 P c12 P  Basalt 0.234 64 0.0340 0.157 33 0.1906  Metasediment –0.044 33 0.6777 0.280 44 0.0142  Sediment 0.462 83 0.0267 0.214 74 0.1844  Mixed 0.135 77 0.2863 0.370 95 0.0094  Note: Moist sites include grand fir, moist Douglas-fir, western redcedar,  and western hemlock habitat types.

The shape of the response surface for metasedimentary  rocks associated with moist habitats is downward sloping  similar to those for drier sites but unlike any other moist  habitat – rock type combination. We feel the absence of re-sponse  to N fertilization by suppressed trees growing on  metasedimentary rocks results from a lack of mineral nutri-ents  such as potassium, phosphorus, and some micronutrients  rather than moisture limitations as previously discussed for  drier sites. We feel this explanation is plausible for two rea-sons:  (i) soils occurring on the moist–metasedimentary sites  have good physical properties with high moisture holding  capacity (Mital 1995); (ii) soils developed from metasedi-mentary  rocks in this region are infertile, particularly with  respect to potassium (Moore et al. 1998). Metasedimentary  rocks are composed primarily of SiO2 (-90% by weight),  with very low content of essential mineral nutrients. Sites  with low potassium status showed significantly lower stand  level response to N fertilization than those with good K sta-tus  (Mika and Moore 1990). The only exception to the gen-eral  N response pattern for 224 versus 448 kg/ha treatment  occurred on metasedimentary rocks associated with moist  habitats (Table 6). The relatively high average individual  tree response is counter to what we expected. The high  N fertilization rate produced significantly higher mortality  rates for the moist habitat type and metasedimentary rock  type category than for any other strata in our study (G. Shen,  C. Hatch, and J. Moore, unpublished data3). The higher mor-tality  likely resulted from N fertilization induced nutrient  imbalances (Mika and Moore 1990; Moore et al. 1998).  Therefore, since our analysis is based only on trees alive at  the end of the period, we feel that the apparent high relative  response to the 448 kg N treatment is at least partially due to  a thinning effect from trees that died during the period.  We suggest that rock type represents broad differences in  the nutrient environment in which trees grow. Using rock  type in an individual tree growth model is analogous to in-cluding  habitat type as a variable to represent differences  in moisture and temperature growing regimes. We feel that  rock type, or a conceptually similar variable, should be use-ful  for explaining variation in tree growth response to silvi-cultural  treatments, such as fertilization, in other geographic  regions.  Essentially all Douglas-fir stands in the Inland Northwest  are deficient in nitrogen (Moore et al. 1991), but, as demon-strated  in our study, the within-stand distribution of fertiliza-tion  growth response among individual trees is influenced  by the availability of other growth limiting resources. Our  results suggest that site moisture and availability of other  nutrients are the factors that affect the different patterns of  individual tree response among stands. Suppressed trees  show the greatest relative differences in growth response to  N fertilization, reflecting acute intertree competitive interac-tions  for moisture, nitrogen, and other nutrients. This finding  leads to the following speculation: currently dominant trees  are sampled for foliage analysis to assay a stand’s nutrient  status (Everard 1973); perhaps, sampling suppressed trees  for foliar analysis would be more diagnostic.  Conclusions  This study quantifies the interactions of tree size, stand  density, habitat type, and rock type to predict individual tree  basal area growth response to N fertilization. Suppressed  trees growing on moist sites and soils derived from granite,  basalt, sedimentary, and mixed (glacial) rock types showed  relatively greater response to N fertilization than dominant  trees in the same stand. However, suppressed trees growing  on drier sites or on soils derived from granite rocks did  not exhibited different relative fertilization response than  dominants. Thus, our study quantitatively demonstrates dif-ferences  in individual tree competitive relationships across  broad differences in the nutrient environment represented  by different rock types. The basal area increment equations  were formulated to be compatible with individual-tree-distance-  independent simulation models. Incorporating these  new equations into growth and yield simulators such as FVS  would allow better representation of N fertilization effects  on stand development dynamics.

Foliar Nutrient and Tree Growth Response of Mixed-conifer Stands to Three Fertilization Treatments in Northeast Oregon and North Central Washington,"Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Shaw, T.M.; Mika, P.G.","The results of two studies evaluating nutrient uptake in mixed-conifer stands following fertilization are reported. The four species examined were Douglas-fir, grand fir, lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine. The fertilization treatments were 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen, 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen plus 112 kg ha-1 sulfur, and 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen plus 190.4 kg ha-1 potassium. Foliar nutrient concentrations, contents and ratios were analyzed, as well as four-year volume response. Douglas-fir showed both N and S deficiencies in control foliage samples, and produced significant growth response to the N + S treatment, but not to the N-alone treatment. Grand fir also showed foliar N and S deficiencies, but produced significant growth response to both N and N +� S fertilization. This suggests that grand fir was better able to utilize N than Douglas-fir even under S-limiting conditions. Lodgepole pine showed deficient foliar N and S concentrations, and produced significant volume responses to N and N +� K fertilization. Lodgepole volume response to N �+ S fertilization was highly variable, and appeared to be site specific. Ponderosa pine did not show nutrient deficiencies for N or K, and did not respond significantly in either foliar K or S levels or in growth to N, N +� K or N� + S fertilization. This suggests that nutrient deficiency may not have been a factor limiting foliar nutrient response and growth for ponderosa pine.",1999-07-28,,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Garrison, M.T., J.A.

The Effect of Multi-nutrient fertilization on Understory Plant Diversity,"VanderSchaaf, C.L.; Moore, J.A.; Kingery, J.L.","This study examined multi-nutrient fertilization effects on understory vegetation diversity at eight forested locations in the inland Northwest. Percent canopy covered by understory plant species of three growth forms (shrubs, forbs, grasses) and total understory were determined over a two year period following treatment. Two diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's index) were used to quantify multi-nutrient fertilization effects on understory plant diversity. Multi-nutrient fertilization prescribed to increase overstory tree growth did not typically reduce understory vegetation diversity, rather diversity increased following fertilization on some sites. Understory composition at the time of treatment greatly determined fertilizalion effects on diversiry as follows: 1) if most species in the plant community responded relatively the same after treatment then diversity was unchanged even though total biomass increase may have been large; 2) if a highly responsive species was abundant prior to treatment. then diversity decreased following fertilization; and 3) if a highly responsive species was relatively rare prior to treatment, then diversity increased following fertilization. Multi-nutrient forest fertilization generally did not affect understory plant diversity, but where changes did occur diversity increases were more common than decreases.",2000-08-10,,research (document genres); shrubs; grasses (plants); fertilizer; statistics;,"VanderSchaaf, C.L., J.A.

Site, treatment and their rnterac-tion  were statistically signiticant tbr all growth  lbrms in 1998. The significant site by treatment  interaction derives from the result that enly 3 of  the 8 sitcs showed significant treatment effects.

North Idaho Nutrition Guidelines by Rock Type,"Garrison-Johston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.","This document was prepared as a guideline for foresters to use in determining appropriate nutrient management strategies for forest stands on various rock types in north Idaho and portions of northeastern Washington. The guidelines proposed in this document are based on both observational and experimental evidence compiled by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) since its inception in 1980.  Nine digital geologic maps covering most of north Idaho and portions of northeastern Washington were compiled for this report. A location map showing the maps used in this compilation is shown in Appendix A. Four of these maps, the Headquarters, Missoula West, Kookia and Hamilton 1:100000 quadrangles, are in preliminary form. Expect the map units to change over time. Stands in these areas MUST be field checked for rock type before proceeding with nutrient management decisions. A listing of all rock units from each of the nine maps was extracted, for a total of approximately 435 rock units. Each of these rock units was assigned to one of 59 lithology groups, labeled as 'LITH_GRP' A complete listing of rock units by map is shown in Appendix D, along with a brief description and the corresponding lithology grouping. Each rock unit was also assigned to one of four broad categories, labeled 'CATEGORY.' These four categories include extrusive/ basaltic rocks, intrusive/ granitic rocks, metamorphic rocks, and mixed rocks.  The following section of the report discusses nutrient management strategies for each rock category. Within each category, the guidelines are further subdivided based on the lithology groupings. These guidelines are based on the current state of knowledge regarding rocks and forest growth. We fully expect these guidelines to be further refined with additional experience and experimentation.  Caveats: Geology maps are a useful tool in forest management. However, the user must be aware that geology maps were not developed for use at the forest stand level. We have found the updated north Idaho geology maps to be very good for giving a general idea of the rocks likely to be found in a particular area, and often the maps are precise to the stand level. Nonetheless, foresters must always verify the rock type in the field before considering fertilization options. The information included in this report is intended only to provide general guidelines to be considered in the formulation of silvicultural prescriptions.",2001-07-30,,research (document genres); geological maps; fertilizer; forest management;,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., and J.A.

An Analysis of Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreak Occurrence as Related to Geology on the Idaho Panhandle National Forests,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Niehoff, G.","Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is a native conifer species which is widely distributed throughout the inland northwest of the United States. This species occurs across a variety of site conditions, and may grow in pure stands or in combination with other tree species common to the area. Douglas-fir is one of the most important timber-producing species in the  region.  A number of insects and diseases affect Douglas-fir stands in the region. Most are endemic to the area and experience natural cycles of buildup and decline. During the late 1990's, an endemic insect known as the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins) began to increase to epidemic proportions throughout much of northern Idaho and northeastern Washington. This beetle burrows into the tree's bark and lays eggs. The adults and larvae then feed on the phloem, usually girdling and killing the tree (Hagle et al. 1987). During 1996 and 1997, an average of 51 ha/yr (125 ac) were affected by new Douglas-fir beetle attacks. By 1998 approximately 479 ha (1185 ac) were affected, and in 1999, aerial surveys indicated that 31,093 ha (76,830 ac) were impacted. These outbreaks caused great concern, due largely to the increased fire danger caused by huge areas of dead timber. Furthermore, as populations built, the beetles were able to spread further and faster than normal, affecting both public and private timberland in the region. The Panhandle National Forests initiated emergency salvage logging operations in the region, both to reduce fire risk and to reduce the risk of beetles spreading to adjacent private lands.  Recent findings in forest health research have indicated that the bedrock geology underlying forest stands may play an important role in forest nutrition, and consequently may affect tree susceptibility to insects and disease. While direct relationships between rocks and forest stand health have not yet been established, we believe that such relationships exist. In the current study, Forest Service workers in north Idaho and northeastern Washington noted a tendency for Douglas-fir beetle outbreaks to occur more frequently on certain rock types than others, even though adjacent stands on other rock types seemed otherwise very similar.

This species occurs across a  variety of site conditions, and may grow in pure stands or in combination with other tree species  common to the area. Douglas-fir is one of the most important timber-producing species in the  region.  A number of insects and diseases affect Douglas-fir stands in the region. Most are  endemic to the area and experience natural cycles of buildup and decline. During the late 1990's,  an endemic insect known as the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins) began  to increase to epidemic proportions throughout much of northern Idaho and northeastern  Washington. This beetle burrows into the tree's bark and lays eggs. The adults and larvae then  feed on the phloem, usually girdling and killing the tree (Hagle et al. 1987). During 1996 and  1997, an average of 51 ha/yr (125 ac) were affected by new Douglas-fir beetle attacks. By 1998  approximately 479 ha (1185 ac) were affected, and in 1999, aerial surveys indicated that 31,093  ha (76,830 ac) were impacted. These outbreaks caused great concern, due largely to the  increased fire danger caused by huge areas of dead timber. Furthermore, as populations built, the  beetles were able to spread further and faster than normal, affecting both public and private  timberland in the region. The Panhandle National Forests initiated emergency salvage logging  operations in the region, both to reduce fire risk and to reduce the risk of beetles spreading to  adjacent private lands.  Recent findings in forest health research have indicated that the bedrock geology  underlying forest stands may play an important role in forest nutrition, and consequently may  affect tree susceptibility to insects and disease. While direct relationships between rocks and  forest stand health have not yet been established, we believe that such relationships exist. In the  current study, Forest Service workers in north Idaho and northeastern Washington noted a  tendency for Douglas-fir beetle outbreaks to occur more frequently on certain rock types than  others, even though adjacent stands on other rock types seemed otherwise very similar. This  analysis utilizes Forest Service data on forest vegetative cover and Douglas-fir beetle distribution  in combination with geologic data to assess whether beetles favored stands on certain rock types.  Data and Analysis  Geographic information system (GIS) layers were obtained from the Panhandle National  Forest for five districts, including the Sandpoint, Bonner's Ferry, Priest River, Coeur d'Alene  River, and the St. Joe Districts. The administrative boundaries for these areas are shown in  Figure 1. The Forest Service provided two data sets. The first type of data was a vegetative  cover layer consisting of individual stands, which met the criteria of being pole-size and larger  timber, that occurred on habitat types having the highest probability of containing Douglas-fir  (Zack, 2001). The second data type was comprised of a series of shape files showing areas  3  3  affected by Douglas-fir beetle for 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. These shape files were digitized  from aerial surveys conducted by the Forest Service's Forest Pest Management group.  Digital geology maps for the region were obtained from the United States Geological  Survey (USGS) and the Idaho Geological Survey (IGS). The Sandpoint 1:250K quadrangle was  merged with the Coeur d'Alene, Thompson Falls, Wallace, St. Maries and Headquarters 1:100K  digital geology maps (Idaho Geological Survey 1996, Lewis and Derkey 1999, Lewis et al. 1999,  Miller et al. 1999, Munts 2000). The geology maps were provided with detailed documentation  describing each map unit. Some re-labeling of map units was necessary in order to maintain a  consistent naming convention across all the different maps. One rock group known as the Belt  Supergroup is prevalent in the inland northwest and in the analysis area. These are  metasedimentary rocks dating from the Precambrian era. The formal nomenclature of these  rocks is based on a hierarchy composed of groups, formations, and members (Lewis 2001, Lewis  and Burmester 1999, Harrison and Campbell 1963). Within the analysis area, the formations that  occurred were Prichard, Burke, Revett, St. Regis, Wallace, Striped Peak, and Libby. The  Prichard and Wallace formations were further subdivided into upper and lower members. The  Burke, Revett and St. Regis formations are often grouped together and called the Ravalli Group.  In addition to these formal names, other lithology information for these formations was also  available. For the Belt rocks, the most common lithologies were argillite, siltite and quartzite or  some combination thereof. Other lithologies common within the area included glacial deposits  and intrusive (granitic) rocks. Since the main topic of interest was whether the Douglas-fir  beetle was more prevalent on Prichard formation rocks than on other rocks, we decided to retain  the formal names for the Belt Supergroup of rocks. For other rocks in the analysis area,  State Boundaries  IPNF District Boundaries  OR  ID  WA  10 0 10 20 Miles N  Priest Lake District  Bonner's Ferry District  Sandpoint District  Coeur d'Alene River District  St. Joe District  4  4  however, we used lithology descriptors. The categories selected for analysis were Prichard  Formation, Wallace Formation, Ravalli Group (undivided), Libby Formation, Striped Peak  Formation, glacial deposits, intrusive rocks, and other rocks. Map 1 in the Appendix shows the  categorized geology layer and the distribution of Douglas-fir stands by size class, while Map 2  illustrates the Douglas-fir beetle outbreak areas for 1996 through 1999.  The geographic analyses were carried out in Arcview. The first analysis step consisted of  intersecting the vegetative cover with the corrected digital geology. By intersecting these layers,  we were able to preserve the individual stand size class information along with the geologic  information for each polygon. Since the beetle outbreaks were digitized from aerial surveys, the  outbreak polygons occasionally showed up as being outside the mapped locations of the  Douglas-fir stands. This was expected; particularly as the data layers were created using varying  methods and compiled at different scales. Therefore, the next analysis step was to clip the  Douglas-fir beetle outbreak areas for 1996 through 1999 to the intersected Douglas-fir/ geology  layer. This ensured that we only analyzed outbreaks for which we had stand size and geology  information. Once this was completed, we created frequency tables for various combinations of  size classes and geology by outbreak year. We exported the frequency tables to a spreadsheet in  order to tabulate values. The outbreak areas for 1996 and 1997 were averaged since the affected  areas for these years were so small compared to 1998 and 1999. To determine which classes to  include in the study, beetle attack frequency was examined by stand size class. We only wanted  to include stands that provided suitable habitat for Douglas-fir beetle. The distribution of  selected stands was tabulated by rock type and these values were used as the expected  distribution of Douglas-fir beetle under the null hypothesis of no rock type effect. Outbreaks  were then tabulated by rock type, and Chi-square tests were performed using the outbreak  distributions as the observed values, and the stand distributions as the expected values (Ott  1988). All frequency tables were created in ArcView and then exported to Excel worksheets for  tabulation and Chi-square testing.  Results and Discussion  Size Class Analysis  As previously stated, only those stands that provided suitable Douglas-fir beetle habitat  were included in the analysis. We requested that the Forest Service provide data for only those  stands in habitat types likely to contain Douglas-fir, and of those stands, only those which were  pole-size or larger. The resultant vegetative cover layer therefore included all stands likely to  contain Douglas-fir, by habitat type and size class. Precise definitions of the various size classes  is provided in the Appendix, but generally 'sawtimber' stands consisted mostly of trees 9 in  diameter at breast height (dbh, measured 4 ½ ft above ground level), while 'poletimber' stands  contained mostly trees which were smaller than 9 in dbh. Stand maturity refers to stage of  development, such that mature stands were those where the growth stage has nearly reached the  full potential of the site, while immature stands are still actively growing. Multistoried stands  contain two or more tree size classes and often represent multi-aged stands. The Douglas-fir  beetle normally prefers trees 12 in dbh, which likely occur in sawtimber stands, and perhaps in  some multistoried stands as well (Hagle et al. 1987). Stand area and yearly outbreak areas by  size class were tabulated to detect any preference shifts as beetle populations increased over the  study period. The results are shown in Figure 2.  5  5  Figure 2 illustrates that most of the analysis area was in mature and immature sawtimber,  with 38% and 49% of the stand area in those size classes, respectively. Douglas-fir beetle would  most likely attack larger tree size classes and this expectation is confirmed in Figure 2 since most  Douglas-fir beetle attacks occurred in larger size classes. In mature sawtimber, the beetle attacks  occurred at rates proportionately higher than the amount of stand area in that size class during all  years, indicating a beetle preference for mature sawtimber. For the immature sawtimber class,  outbreak rates were proportionately lower from 1996 through 1998, but by 1999 the beetle-affected  area was proportionately greater than the amount of land area in immature sawtimber.  This result probably means that by 1999, the beetle populations had increased to such high levels  that the immature sawtimber stands became desirable. A very small percentage of the analysis  area was in multistoried stands, and no preferences by the beetles were detected by year in this  class. In the poletimber size classes, the proportion of beetle-attacked area was proportionately  lower than the amount of Douglas-fir stands in those size classes for all years. Based on this  result, we excluded poletimber and multistoried stands from the study, and the remaining  analyses were performed only on mature and immature sawtimber stands in the Panhandle  National Forest.  Geology  In order to detect beetle preferences for stands growing on particular rock types, we first  tabulated the total hectares of study stands by rock type. We then tabulated the hectares of  outbreaks by rock type, for each year of the study. If there were no preference for stands on  particular rock types, then beetle outbreaks would occur in about the same proportion across all  rock types. For example, if 20% of the stand area occurs on Prichard rock types, then 20% of the  outbreaks in any particular year should also occur on that same rock type.

Wallace showed high  outbreak rates for 1998 and 1999, while the Ravalli Group was heavily affected in 1999. Libby,  Striped Peak and glacial tills all showed beetle outbreak rates lower than expected. Intrusive  rocks had high outbreak rates in 1997. Stands in the 'Other Rocks' category were not heavily  affected in any year. A Chi-square (χ2) test on these values was performed using the formula:  χ2 = Σ((E – O)2/E)  where: E= expected value and O=observed value. Results of the Chi-square analysis are shown  in Table 2.  Table 2.

This was true for all three time  periods studied. Among the individual cells, both the 1996-97 and the 1998 outbreaks on  Prichard were significantly greater than the amount of stand area on this rock type. Outbreaks on  other rocks showed tendencies towards disproportionate distribution, though these tendencies  were not significant in the Chi-square test. Individual rock categories are discussed below.  Prichard Formation  Figure 3 indicates that approximately 19% of the sawtimber stands in the Panhandle  region occurred on the Prichard formation. In contrast, the Douglas-fir beetle infestations in all  years occurred in much higher proportions on Prichard stands than on other rock types. In 1996-  97, which were not considered outbreak years, an average of 35% of the area affected by  Douglas-fir beetle occurred on the Prichard. In 1998, the first serious outbreak year, 40% of the  affected areas were on Prichard. The Chi-square test indicated that the 1996-97 and the 1998  outbreaks on Prichard were both significantly higher than the proportion of stands on Prichard.  In 1999, the year of the most widespread outbreaks, 30% of the affected area occurred on  Prichard. This value was not significant in the Chi-square test, however it was still  proportionately higher compared to the total area of sawtimber-sized stands on Prichard. We  8  8  believe that the beetle populations had built up so much in the preceding years that the beetles  were able to attack stands on previously less susceptible rock types.  Wallace Formation  The results in Figure 3 and Table 2 show that the Wallace formation was also affected at  a rate disproportionate to the amount of Douglas-fir stand area on that rock type. While the non-epidemic  1996-97 outbreaks were low compared to the amount of stand area on Wallace, in  1998, 47 % of the beetle outbreak areas occurred on the 29% of stands located on Wallace  formation rocks. Although the Chi-square analysis indicated that this was not a statistically  significant overall difference, we decided to look at individual members of the Wallace  formation in more detail. A summary of the land area in sawtimber and the beetle outbreak areas  for members of the Wallace formation is shown in Table 3. Figure 4 represents these values as  percentages of total area, for Wallace formation stands only.  Table 3. Land area in sawtimber stands on Wallace, and outbreak areas from 1996 through 1999, for members of the  Wallace formation, for the Panhandle National Forests in north Idaho and northeast Washington.

Approximately 34% of the Wallace sawtimber stands were  on the upper Wallace, while the remaining 6% occurred on undivided Wallace formation, which  means that these rocks were not distinguishable as upper or lower. While the majority of  sawtimber did occur on lower Wallace, an even larger proportion of the Douglas-fir beetle  outbreaks occurred on the lower Wallace in all years. During 1996-97 and 1998, 83% and 81%  respectively of the outbreak areas occurred on lower Wallace. Conversely, only 14% and 17%  of the outbreaks during the same years occurred on the upper Wallace stands. This suggests that  the beetles preferred trees on the lower Wallace to stands on the upper Wallace. This conclusion  was supported by the Chi-square analysis, shown in Table 4.  Table 4. Chi-square test on Wallace Formation. Chi-square (χ2)  test for differences between expected values (percent stand area on  Wallace) and observed values (percent outbreak area on Wallace),  by year.  1996-97  average  outbreaks  1998  outbreaks  1999  outbreaks  Wallace, lower 8.807 7.536 0.291  Wallace, undivided 1.959 2.993 0.000  Wallace, upper 11.305 8.568 0.514  χ2 22.071 19.097 0.805  test statistic df=2, α=.05 5.991 5.991 5.991  The Chi-square test indicated that during 1996-97 and 1998, beetle outbreaks on the Wallace  formation were significantly different from the distribution of stands on Wallace. Examination  of individual cells showed an interesting phenomenon in terms of the lower versus the upper  Wallace formation. On the lower Wallace, the proportion of 1996-97 and 1998 outbreaks were  significantly greater than the proportion of stand area on lower Wallace. This indicated a  preference for stands on lower Wallace. Furthermore, the occurrence of outbreaks on the upper  Wallace during those same years was significantly lower than the proportion of stand area on  upper Wallace, indicating that these stands were less desirable to the beetles. In all cases, the  1999 affected areas were not significantly different from the expected distributions. We believe  that by 1999 the beetle populations were so large that preference was no longer being shown for  stands on particular rock types.  Intrusive Rocks  Figure 3 also showed that sawtimber stands on intrusive rocks suffered a disproportionate  amount of Douglas-fir beetle attacks during 1996-97. While total acreages during pre-outbreak  years were relatively small, we decided to look at the intrusives in more detail. The intrusives  category encompassed 55 individual rock units. Most of these rock units represented local  plutons or other granitic structures (dikes, sills, etc.). By examining the percentages of  sawtimber stands on each unit and comparing the beetle-affected areas for the three time periods  in the same units, we determined that most of the disproportionate attacks were occurring on  three rock units. These were the Galena Point Granodiorite, a pluton southwest of Priest Lake in  north Idaho (Kgp); diabase sills and dikes associated with the Prichard formation in the  Sandpoint and Bonner's Ferry districts (Ymi); and gabbroic and dioritic sills in the St. Joe district  10  10  (Tkgb). Land areas of sawtimber stands and beetle-affected areas on intrusive rocks in the  analysis area are provided in Table 5 and Figure 5.  Table 5. Land area in sawtimber stands on intrusive rocks, and outbreak areas from 1996 through 1999 on intrusive  rocks, north Idaho and northeast Washington.

While 13% of the outbreak area in 1996-97 occurred on Tkgb, 41% of the outbreak area  occurred on Ymi. The stand areas occurring on these types were 2% and 12%, respectively. A  Chi-square analysis was performed on these four intrusive rock categories, and results are shown  in Table 5.  Figure 4: Percent of land area in sawtimber and percent of Douglas-fir beetle outbreak areas from 1996  through 1999 on intrusive rocks, in north Idaho and northeast Washington.

The Tkgb unit  represents gabbroic and dioritic sills, while the Ymi represents diabase sills and dikes associated  with the Prichard formation. All of these rocks are likely to contain high amounts of calcium,  iron and/or magnesium, and relatively low amounts of potassium. They are also coarse-grained  rocks, and likely to weather to coarse, gravelly soils with poor water-holding capacity and low  CEC. So for these reasons, we might expect these rocks to be 'bad rocks' from a nutrient  standpoint. However another possible explanation is related to the surrounding rocks. The Ymi  unit is associated with and surrounded by Prichard formation rocks, and likewise lower Wallace  surrounds the Tkgb formation. See Map 3, Figures (a) and (b) in the appendix for a closer view  of the geology surrounding these units. The stands on these rocks may simply have been victims  of spatial circumstance, as they were in direct proximity to stands that were highly likely to  harbor Douglas-fir beetle populations.  The third intrusive rock, Kgp, was a granodiorite. Ten percent of all stands on intrusive  rocks occurred on the Kgp rock type, and during 1996-97 and 1998, beetle outbreaks were  proportionately low on this rock. However in 1999, 43% of the outbreaks on intrusive rocks  were on this unit. The Chi-square test indicated that this was significantly greater than the  proportion of stand areas on Kgp. Normally we expect granodiorites to be 'medium' rocks,  particularly if they are biotite-bearing as this one is. And beetle outbreaks at these high rates did  not hit most other granodiorite or biotite-bearing rocks in the study area, even during the peak  outbreak in 1999. However, examination of the digital geology indicated that this rock is  surrounded by Prichard formation (Map 3, Figure (a)). We believe that the high attack rates on  this rock type occurred because beetle populations built up in the surrounding Prichard-based  stands, and then subsequently attacked stands on the Galena Point granodiorite pluton.  Finally, the Chi-square analysis indicated that with these three rock types separated from  the rest of the intrusive rocks, the remaining 75% of all sawtimber stands on intrusive rocks had  significantly lower outbreaks during all years in the study period. This indicated that in normal  years, stands on intrusive rocks that were not surrounded by Prichard or lower Wallace rocks  were not likely to be targeted by Douglas-fir beetles. Even during the epidemic outbreaks in  1999, these other intrusives were attacked at significantly lower rates than expected compared to  the amount of stand area they contain.  12  12  Other Belt Rocks  Among the other Belt rocks, the Libby and Striped Peak formations showed low beetle  attack frequency. These rocks hosted 2% and 9%, respectively, of the stands studied. Douglas-fir  beetle outbreaks affected these stands at very low rates, with 1% and 4% of the epidemic 1999  outbreaks occurring on these rocks. These differences were not significant in the Chi-square  analysis. The Ravalli group, which occurred beneath 13% of the study area, showed very few  outbreaks during 1996-97 and 1998 relative to the rock land area. However in 1999, outbreaks  on the Ravalli group greatly increased to 22% of all outbreaks for that year, though the Chi-square  test indicated that this was not statistically significant. As the Ravalli group is composed  of three formations (Burke, St. Regis, Revett), we did examine these formations individually.  We did not see any particular patterns or trends among the formations, though the Burke did  show a higher percentage of outbreaks in both 1998 and 1999 as compared to the St. Regis,  Revett and undivided Ravalli rock units. Examination of the geology and outbreak maps in GIS  indicated that many of the Ravalli stands that were affected in 1999 occurred adjacent to  Prichard stands. We believe that the Ravalli stands were attacked more heavily in 1999 due to  the buildup of beetle populations in adjacent Prichard rocks during previous years.  Glacial Deposits and Other Rocks  Approximately 11% of the stands studied occurred on glacial deposits. Though the  differences between stand occurrence and outbreak occurrences on glacial deposits were not  significant in the Chi-square analysis, we did see a steady decrease in the proportion of outbreaks  on glacial deposits during the entire study period. While the outbreaks in 1996-97 were  proportional to the amount of stand area on glacial deposits, when outbreaks increased during  1998 and 1999, the beetles showed a marked preference towards stands on other rocks. This  would indicate that stands on glacial till were undesirable to the Douglas-fir beetles, even when  outbreaks increased to epidemic proportions and they appeared to be attacking previously less  desirable stands.  Other rocks occurred under about 3% of the study area. Rocks in this category included  carbonate rocks, metamorphic rocks, other (non-glacial) deposits, extrusive rocks and  sedimentary rocks. While these rocks may also support stands that respond more or less  favorably to beetle attacks, they were uncommon in the study area and a more detailed analysis  was not possible. In the overall study area, rocks in this category did seem to be affected by  beetles at rates that were about proportional to the amount of stand area on those rocks. There  were no significant differences during any of the years studied.  Conclusions  Most of the Douglas-fir beetle attacks on the Panhandle National Forests occurred in  sawtimber-sized stands. While the mature sawtimber was initially attacked at high rates, once  populations built up in 1996-97 and 1998, immature sawtimber was also attacked.  Results of the geologic analysis supported the hypothesis that Douglas-fir stands on the  Prichard formation were more likely to be attacked by Douglas-fir beetle than stands on other  rock types. We also found that stands on the lower Wallace formation were more susceptible to  beetle attacks. Among the intrusive rocks, stands on three geologic units (Galena Point  granodiorite, gabbroic and dioritic sills, and diabase sills and dikes associated with the Prichard  formation) showed higher susceptibility to beetles than stands on other intrusives. The dikes  13  13  and sills in particular had characteristics that might lead us to classify them as bad rocks from a  nutrient perspective. However, in all cases, the intrusive units were in close proximity with  Prichard and/or lower Wallace, leading us to believe that beetle populations from those  neighboring stands attacked these stands. Beetles affected stands on other intrusive rocks at  much lower rates than proportional to their occurrence. Similarly, stands on glacial deposits  appeared less desirable to beetles, as during all years of the study they were attacked at rates low  in proportion to their occurrence. Stands on the Striped Peak and Libby formations also showed  low outbreak rates. Stands on the Ravalli group did show high rates of attack in 1999, and closer  inspection of the formations comprising the Ravalli group indicated that stands on the Burke  formation showed high rates of attack in 1998 and 1999. However since these stands were in  close proximity to Prichard stands, it is possible that beetles from the neighboring stands caused  the outbreaks on Burke.  On all rock types, proportions of outbreaks in 1999 were not significantly different from  the proportions of stand areas on those rock types. We believe that by 1999 the beetle  populations were so great that they attacked nearly everywhere, including stands previously less  desirable to them. Thus, the 1999 distributions of beetle-affected areas began to more closely  approximate the actual stand areas on different rock types.  Management Implications  The Douglas-fir beetles appeared to prefer stands containing mostly mature sawtimber  that were growing on Prichard or lower Wallace rock types. Since so many of the stands on the  Panhandle which we identified as likely to contain Douglas-fir were in mature and immature  sawtimber, AND so much of the area is on Prichard and lower Wallace rocks, the region was  heavily predisposed to the outbreaks which occurred in the late 1990's. One possible strategy to  avoid future outbreaks of this sort might be to intersperse some younger or multistoried stands  throughout the area. A shift in species composition away from Douglas-fir might be appropriate  in some circumstances. Douglas-fir will encroach on ponderosa pine stands in the absence of  fire, so prescribed burning or other means of removal of the Douglas-fir on drier habitat types  might be warranted. We recommend managing for species other than Douglas-fir on Prichard  and lower Wallace rock types.  References:  Dutro, J.T., Jr., R.V. Dietrich and R. M. Foose, 1989 (compilers).

This usually  occurs when a stand reaches 95 percent of culmination mean annual  increment (CMAI).  High risk is defined as generally the point in time when at least 40  percent of the stand, as measured by basal area, is affected by damaging  disease or insects.  Multisized stands contain more than one age class (usually at least three  age classes) intermingled intimately on the same area, and the difference  in age between the oldest and youngest trees exceeds 20 percent of the  length of the rotation. Use code MULS for stands containing two age  classes. Use code MULT for stands containing at least three age classes.  Stand size class year of origin, 2111, should be entered when the stand size  class is either MULS or MULT.  17  17  State Boundaries  Pan_df_stands_bdry.shp  Immature Poletimber  Immature Sawtimber  Multistoried  Poletimber  Sawtimber  Forest District Boundaries  N  20 0 20 40 Miles  Geology of Analysis Area Douglas-fir Stands in Analysis Area  Analysis Area  State Boundaries  Geology of Project Area  Prichard formation  Wallace formation  Ravalli Group  Striped Peak formation  Libby formation  Intrusive Rocks  Glacial Deposits  Other Rocks  water  Forest District Boundaries  Map Sheet 1: Geology of Panhandle administrative districts,  and distribution of Douglas-fir stands within the districts.  18  18  State Boundaries  1998 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  1997 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  1996 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  Forest District Boundaries  State Boundaries  1999 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  1998 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  1997 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  1996 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  20 0 20 40 Miles Forest District Boundaries  Analysis Area  Douglas-fir Beetle 1996-1998 Affected Areas Douglas-fir Beetle 1996-1999 Affected Area  N  Map Sheet 2: Distribution of new Douglas-fir beetle outbreaks  between 1996 and 1999 on the Panhandle National Forests.  19  19  (a)  (b)  N  10 0 10 20 Miles  10 0 10 20 Miles  Gabbroic and  dioritic sills  Geology of Project Area  Diabase sills and dikes intruding Prichard  Gabbroic and dioritic sills  Galena Point Granodiorite  Glacial Deposits  Intrusive Rocks  Libby formation  Other Rocks  Prichard formation  Ravalli Group  Striped Peak formation  Wallace, lower  Wallace, undivided  Wallace, upper  water  1999 Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreaks  Forest District Boundaries  Analysis  Areas  (a)  (b)  Diabase sills  Galena Point and dikes  Granodiorite  Map Sheet 3.

ABSTRACT: This study quantified the effects of operational multinutrient fertilization on understory shrub,  forb, and grass production in inland Northwest forests. Understory vegetation annual production increased at  some sites while other sites showed no change or decreases following fertilizer treatments. The greatest  understory response to fertilization occurred in low density, shade-intolerant, overstory-dominated stands.  Understory vegetation response was lower under overstories dominated by more shade-tolerant conifers.  Multinutrient fertilization produced increases in annual understory production of up to 2,400 lb/ac for  combined understory growth forms over the entire growing season. West. J. Appl. For. 17(3):147–153.  Key Words: Fertilizer, understory vegetation.  Forest fertilization may be an effective treatment to increase  or maintain multiple resource outputs on a declining land  base. Most forests in the inland Northwest are nutrient  deficient, and overstory conifers respond favorably follow-ing  fertilization (Shaffii et al. 1989, Moore et al. 1991,  Garrison et al. 2000). However, information regarding fertili-zation  effects on understory vegetation in the inland North-west  is minimal. Overstory tree density and species effects on  subordinate understory vegetation response to fertilization  have also not been extensively studied in the region.  Productivity of forest plants is influenced by many  factors, such as genetics, climate, nutrition, and soil mois-ture  (Gessel et al. 1960, Riegel et al. 1995, Klinka et al.  1996). Nutrition is one factor that can be feasibly and  economically manipulated. Following fertilization, under-story  growth may increase because existing plants are  nutrient-limited, may remain unchanged because optimum  nutrient amounts already exist, or may decrease due to  increased competition from the tree overstory, toxicity, or  nutrient imbalance. Understory response substantially de-pends  on the nutrient requirements of the existing plant  community (Chapin et al. 1986).  Several studies have shown that understory plant commu-nities  in mature forests respond to nitrogen fertilization  (Freyman and van Ryswyk 1969, Abrams and Dickmann  Note: James Moore can be reached at (208) 885-7952; Fax: (208) 885-6226;  E-mail: jamoore@uidaho.edu.

These studies suggest that N  fertilization may increase understory vegetation production  in conifer stands but that the level of response will likely  depend on specific site/treatment interactions. One of these  factors is overstory tree density (Jameson 1967, Persson  1981, Alaback and Herman 1988, Riegel et al. 1995, Nabuurs  1996, Klinka et al. 1996, Peitz et al. 1999). Understory  vegetation growth response to fertilization may be affected  by increased overstory tree growth, as well as by initial stand  density. Tree foliar biomass increases following fertilization  for many conifer species (Turner and Olson 1976, Turner  1977, Brix 1981, Teskey et al. 1994), and derives from both  increases in needle production and retention of older needle  age classes (Turner 1979).  Understanding the interaction between overstory density  and understory response is important since wildlife species use  understory vegetation for cover, nesting, and food (Alaback  and Herman 1988, Stubbendieck et al. 1997). Many forest  stands are also grazed by livestock (Tisdale 1961, Geist 1976).  Thinnings, coupled with fertilization, could increase  biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and range productivity. The  above literature suggests that fertilization increases the quan-tity  of the understory for browse and forage. Other research has  shown that animals prefer fertilized vegetation over unfertil-ized  (Anderson et al. 1974, Geist et al. 1974, Nams et al.1993,  Kimball et al. 1998). If annual understory vegetation produc-tion  increases in fertilized areas, then wildlife habitat and  grazing conditions will be generally improved since there will  be more vegetative growth available for food and cover.  Accurate quantification of response to different nutri-ent  applications will allow more informed vegetation  Technical Note  148 WJAF 17(3) 2002  manipulation to best meet management objectives. Thus, the  primary objective of this study was to determine if  multinutrient fertilization increased understory biomass in  inland Northwest conifer stands. We also wanted to see if  different overstory densities and/or species composition af-fected  understory response.  Methods  Eight different sites from five general locations, three in  Idaho and one each in Oregon and Washington, were in-cluded  in this study. The study sites were selected to be  representative of mid-elevation conifer forests in the inland  Northwest with elevations ranging between 670 and 1,245 m.  A range of habitat types, tree densities, and overstory species  was sampled (Table 1). Overstory tree species composition  included natural, second-growth, mixed conifers as well as  plantations composed of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)  or ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). The study sites did not  have any sort of overstory tree cutting within the last 10 yr,  and they represent a range of site and stand conditions often  targeted for operational forest fertilization in the region.  Study Design  The study areas were designed to be fertilizer trials within  much larger operational fertilization areas. Size of experi-mental  areas ranged from 10 to 120 ha, and the physical  arrangement of the various study sites differed resulting in  six to ten transects per site. The fertilizer and control  treatments were randomly assigned to study stands within a  site to the extent possible, given operational constraints.  Aerial photographs were used to help determine the exact  locations of the fertilized units, and boundaries were marked  for each treatment location. Fertilizers were applied aerially  by helicopter, and containers were placed throughout each  treatment area to collect fertilizer. Collected fertilizer was  then weighed to monitor and ensure even distribution through-out  the study site. The fertilizer blends and treatment dates for  each stand are provided in Table 1. We assume that the small  differences in the micronutrient component of the fertilizer  blends had no significant effect on understory response.  One-hundred-meter transects were established in both  control and fertilized areas, with 13 m2 subplots located every  10 m along a transect for a total of 11 subplots. Transects were  placed in each stand to minimize variability within a transect  as well as to capture variation across the treatment unit. A  transect is the sample unit in this study for both understory  vegetation and overstory basal area measurements. Over-story  tree measurements were made on variable radius plots  located at each vegetation subplot just prior to treatment.  Vegetation Measurements  Three growth forms were sampled: shrubs, forbs, and  grasses, using the 13 m2 subplots following protocols de-scribed  in Moeur (1985). Sampling occurred in midsummer  and late summer of 1997 and 1998. The exact sampling date  differed by site to make plant phenological development  stage similar among sites. We wanted to sample during the  period of maximum understory production and again at the  end of the growing season. Vegetation sampling plots were  marked with a PVC pipe in the center. Variable-radius  overstory tree plots were centered on the vegetation plots to  Table 1.

Each measured tree was marked at diameter breast height  (dbh) to assist in future remeasurements. Average basal area/  ha and crown competition factor (CCF) (Krajieck et al 1961)  were calculated as the average of the transects for each  treatment (Table 1).  The need to quickly and accurately estimate the amount of  herbage in a pasture or forest is recognized by most research-ers  (Haydock and Shaw 1975). Measuring plant yield directly  by clipping is accurate; however, only a limited number of  samples are feasible, and the method is destructive (Haydock  and Shaw 1975, Tucker 1980, Erixson 1993). Many samples  of lower precision are better than a few samples of high  precision to account for vegetation variability across a site  (Haydock and Shaw 1975). Tucker (1980) analyzed five  different methods to obtain yield and found that the compara-tive  yield method was the most reliable. This method allows  for greater numbers of sample plots compared to using the  clipping-only method, although there is a loss of individual  quadrat precision. However, due to larger sample size, the  precision of the overall site estimate of annual production  may increase (Haydock and Shaw 1975).  Understory biomass was estimated using the comparative  yield method of Haydock and Shaw (1975) to reduce the  amount of vegetation destruction and sampling time. At each  permanent understory sample plot, two separate components  were involved in estimating annual production based on the  comparative yield method: destructive (clipping and weigh-ing)  and nondestructive (ocular estimates) plots. General  methodology was as follows: first, five 1 m2 reference quad-rats  were selected that constituted the yield scale against  which the yields of the sample 13 m2 subplots were rated for  each site. Two 1 m2 quadrats (standards 1 and 5) were  established on low and high yielding areas to define a range  that included most dry matter yield samples within each site.  Then a 1 m2 location within the site was selected that approxi-mated  dry matter yield midway between those for 1 and 5.  Subsequently, 1 m2 quadrats (standards 2 and 4) were se-lected  that approximated yields midway between 1 and 3, and  3 and 5, respectively. Next, the 13 m2 subplots along the  transect lines were ocularly estimated using the previously  established yield rating. Each 13 m2 subplot was divided into  quarters, and a 1 m2 quadrat was placed in the middle of each  quarter and rated according to one of the five scale categories.  All four ratings were then averaged to obtain a rating for the  13 m2 subplot. After all subplots were rated, the five intensive  sampling quadrats were harvested at each study site. Forbs  and grasses were clipped at ground level, and shrub produc-tion  was estimated using the reference unit method proposed  by Erixson (1993). This method consisted of using a clipped  twig from a plot perimeter representing between 30 and  100% of the average aboveground annual production for  shrubs. The selected twig became the reference unit to which  all other twigs were compared. Live annual production for  each shrub was ocularly estimated to the nearest 1% of its  weight relative to the reference unit (i.e., the selected twig);  estimates for each shrub were then summed to obtain plot  totals. The reference unit method was used in our study to  efficiently obtain green and dry weights for shrubs in the  clipped square meter plots. Several researchers have found  that this method is nearly as accurate as clipping and weigh-ing  all shrubs (Andrew et al. 1979, Kirmse and Norton 1985,  Erixson 1993).  All harvested material was stored in plastic bags, placed in  a cooler, transported back to the laboratory, and then oven-dried  at 70°C for 48 hr (Erixson 1993). A site-sampling  period-treatment-year specific regression equation was de-veloped  relating dry weight yield from the clipped plots to the  ocular scale rating from the same clipped plots. Yield for any  13 m2 subplot was then obtained by substituting its ocular  rating into the regression equation. Grazing was excluded  from the study sites, except for a light amount at the New  Meadows location.  Statistical Analysis  Understory vegetation annual production (AP) was the  dependent variable in our analysis. Understory vegetation  AP was computed and analyzed separately for shrubs, forbs,  and grasses, as well as collectively for all three growth forms.  The 13 m2 subplots were averaged by transect; the transect  estimates were then averaged within each site and treatment  and the averages used in the subsequent statistical analyses.  Individual growth form AP was estimated by multiplying  average site and treatment combination percent covers (based  on Daubenmire 1959) by the average site and treatment  combination AP (Payne 1974, Olson and Martin 1981). This  experiment was designed for using Analysis of Variance  (ANOVA), and statistical comparisons among fertilizer treat-ments  were conducted using PROC GLM of the Statistical  Analysis System (SAS Institute Inc. 1989). The significance  level chosen for statistical tests was 0.10.  Results  Shrub, forb, grass, and combined growth form AP differed  by study site. Treatment produced a significant main effect  for all growth forms. Forb and combined growth form AP  varied significantly by sampling period. A significant treat-ment  by sampling period interaction was evident only for  combined growth forms. Analyses of all four growth forms  showed significant treatment by site interactions. The site by  sampling period interaction was significant for forbs, grasses,  and combined growth forms.  Site-specific least square mean estimates of AP by treat-ment  and sampling period for each understory plant growth  form are provided in Table 2. Multinutrient fertilization pro-duced  significant increases in AP during 1998 for most growth  forms at the New Meadows ponderosa pine, Potlatch western  redcedar (Thuja plicata)/grand fir (Abies grandis), Potlatch  ponderosa pine plantation, and the Wallowa ponderosa pine  plantation sites for both sampling periods (Table 2). Excep-tions  were shrubs and grasses for both sampling periods at the  New Meadows ponderosa pine site, grasses at the Potlatch  western redcedar/grand fir site for both sampling periods, and  shrubs in late summer and forbs during midsummer at the  Wallowa ponderosa pine plantation. Understory vegetation  AP following fertilization did not significantly increase at the  150 WJAF 17(3) 2002  Bovill mixed-conifer, Potlatch Douglas-fir plantation, and the  Wallowa mixed-conifer sites for both sampling periods of  1998 (Table 2). The only significant increase in AP at the  Goldendale mixed-conifer site was for grasses in late summer.  Discussion  Combined Growth Forms  Total understory vegetation AP is useful to measure  changes in the entire plant community following multinutrient  fertilization. Site, treatment, and their interaction were statis-tically  significant for all growth forms. All significant treat-ment  effects were positive; no treated areas showed signifi-cantly  lower AP than the controls (Table 2). The dominant  understory species at the significantly responding New Mead-ows  ponderosa pine site were the shrubs common snowberry  (Symphoricarpos albus), western serviceberry (Amelanchier  alnifolia), the forbs western yarrow (Achillea millefolium),  and strawberry (Vesca spp.), and the grasses elk sedge (Carex  geyeri) and pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens). The domi-nant  understory species at the Potlatch western redcedar/  grand fir stand were common snowberry, and the forbs  Menzie’s silene (Silene menziesii) and western starflower  (Trientalis latifolia). The statistically significant response  was not visually apparent at this site partly because under-story  vegetation amounts were so low, even in the treated  area. This low absolute amount of increased production  should have little effect on animal-carrying capacity. It is  surprising that a response occurred at this site at all since the  understory species are late-seral and thus adapted to low light  and tightly cycled nutrients (Tilman 1985) and usually show  lower response to increased nutrients (Grime 1977). No  individual species substantially changed in percent cover  following fertilization at this site.  A significant increase in understory AP was also produced  at the Potlatch ponderosa pine plantation. The greatest re-sponse  (approximately 2,400 lb/ac) occurred in midsummer  (Table 2). The shrubs common snowberry, western service-berry,  the forbs speedwell (Veronica spp.) and western yar-row,  and the grasses Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) and  pinegrass dominated the understory. Large increases in  percent cover following fertilization were seen for common  snowberry, strawberry, western yarrow, bluegrass, and  pinegrass. Speedwell percent cover substantially decreased  in the fertilized unit. Overstory basal area was relatively low  in this plantation.  Significant understory biomass increases were seen at the  Wallowa ponderosa pine plantation, and response peaked in  midsummer at about 1,100 lb/ac (Table 2). The dominant  understory species were the shrubs common snowberry and  thimbleberry (Rubus parvifolia), the forbs strawberry and  montana thermopsis (Thermopsis montana), and the grasses  Kentucky bluegrass and slender hairgrass (Deschampsia  elongata). Substantial increases in percent cover occurred for  thimbleberry and slender hairgrass, while no individual spe-cies  substantially decreased in percent cover.  Many of the species occurring on our sites that showed  significant understory fertilization response, such as common  snowberry, western yarrow, thimbleberry, western starflower,  elk sedge, pinegrass, bluegrass (Poa canbyi), and tufted hairgrass  (Deschampsia caespitosa), have been demonstrated to re-spond  to fertilization in other studies (Freyman and van Ryswyk  1969, Bowns 1971, Riegel et al. 1991, Prescott et al. 1993,  Nams et al. 1993). Decomposition rates should increase as a  result of increased production at responding sites (Flanagan  and Van Cleve 1983) and should produce a future increase in  nutrient availability for the overstory trees (Flanagan and Van  Cleve 1983, Chapin et al. 1986).

Changes  in grasses and forbs will have more impact on grazing  animals (i.e., cattle and elk), and changes in shrubs should  have more effect on animals that are browsers (i.e., white-tailed  deer) (Holechek et al. 1995). Therefore, we analyzed  shrub, forb, and grass AP separately.  Shrubs  Shrub AP increased for most sites and sampling periods  coincident with overall annual production increases (Table 2)  except for the New Meadows ponderosa pine site for both  sampling periods and the Wallowa ponderosa pine plantation  in late summer. Common snowberry was a dominant shrub  and was responsive at all three sites where overall AP  increased. This species is known to be responsive to fertiliza-tion  (Riegel et al. 1991, Prescott et al. 1993). However,  snowberry cover decreased at the Wallowa mixed-conifer  site and the Potlatch Douglas-fir plantation. Other shrubs that  showed cover increases for at least one site were thimble-berry  at the Wallowa ponderosa pine plantation; Utah honey-suckle  (Lonicera utahensis) at the Wallowa mixed-conifer  site; Rocky mountain maple (Acer glabrum) at the Potlatch  Douglas-fir plantation; squaw carpet (Ceanothus prostratus)  at the Goldendale mixed-conifer site; and blueberry  (Vaccinium spp.) at the Bovill mixed-conifer site. Abrams  and Dickmann (1983) found that another species of Vaccinium  was responsive to fertilization. Pinemat manzanita (Arcto-staphylos  nevadensis) did not respond to fertilization, show-ing  decreased cover in fertilized areas at the Goldendale  mixed-conifer site. Nams et al. (1993) found that kinnikinnik  (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) also did not respond to fertiliza-tion.  Rose (Rosa spp.) also decreased in cover at the Wallowa  mixed-conifer site inconsistent with the findings of Prescott  et al. (1993), and shiny-leaf spirea (Spirea betulifolia) cover  decreased at the Potlatch Douglas-fir plantation.  Forbs  Forbs showed significant AP increases at the New Mead-ows  ponderosa pine, Potlatch western redcedar/grand fir, and  the Potlatch ponderosa pine plantation sites for both sam-pling  periods. A significant increase was also observed at the  Wallowa ponderosa pine plantation in late summer. Western  yarrow showed large cover increases at the New Meadows  ponderosa pine site, the Potlatch ponderosa pine plantation,  and the Goldendale mixed-conifer site consistent with the  results of Nams et al. (1993). Strawberry also substantially  increased in cover at the Potlatch ponderosa pine plantation,  and hawkweed (Hieracium spp.) was highly responsive at the  Goldendale mixed-conifer site. Speedwell cover greatly de-creased  at the Potlatch ponderosa pine plantation site, and  Montana thermopsis decreased at the two Wallowa sites.  Grasses  Grasses responded less frequently to multinutrient fertili-zation  than did shrubs and forbs. Significant grass AP in-creases  were observed for both sampling periods at the  Potlatch and Wallowa ponderosa pine plantations. Grasses at  the Goldendale mixed-conifer site also increased for late  summer. Large increases were observed for pinegrass cover  at the Potlatch ponderosa pine plantation. This species has  been shown to be highly responsive to fertilization (Freyman  and van Ryswyk 1969, Riegel et al. 1991), but no increase  was observed at the New Meadows ponderosa pine site.  Bluegrass, which has been shown to be highly responsive to  fertilization (Bowns 1971), and Columbia brome (Bromus  vulgaris) cover increased at the Potlatch ponderosa pine and  Douglas-fir plantations. Cover also increased for slender  hairgrass at the Wallowa ponderosa pine plantation. Bowns  (1971) found that another species of Deschampsia responded  to fertilization. Western fescue (Festuca occidentalis) at the  Goldendale mixed-conifer site also responded strongly. Nams  et al. (1993) reported that another species of Festuca re-sponded  to fertilization. Elk sedge decreased in cover at the  New Meadows ponderosa pine site inconsistent with the  findings of Riegel et al. (1991).  Operational fertilization in our study produced variable  understory vegetation responses in inland Northwest conifer  stands. However, response was generally predictable. The  Bovill mixed-conifer (dominated by grand fir, Douglas-fir,  and western redcedar), Potlatch Douglas-fir plantation, and  the Wallowa mixed-conifer (dominated by grand fir, Dou-glas-  fir, and Engelmann spruce [Picea engelmannii]) sites  showed no significant changes in AP for combined or indi-vidual  growth forms (Table 2). The Goldendale mixed-conifer  site (dominated by Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine)  showed significant biomass increase for only one growth  form. These four sites contained some of the same understory  species that responded to fertilization at other sites. Greater  understory biomass response was evident in stands domi-nated  by shade-intolerant overstory species (ponderosa pine)  than those with moderately shade-tolerant (Douglas-fir) and  shade-tolerant overstory (western redcedar, grand fir, Engel-mann  spruce) species.  Stands with lower overstory density showed more under-story  production in our control treatments, consistent with  work conducted by Jameson 1967, Alaback and Herman 1988,  Uresk and Severson 1989, and Klinka et al. 1996. Low-density  stands also produced larger understory response to fertilization  in our study. The western redcedar/grand fir site at Potlatch  showed statistically significant production increases follow-ing  multinutrient fertilization; however, the magnitude of  annual production response was small compared to the ponde-rosa  pine plantations and the New Meadows ponderosa pine  site. This result is as expected, since understory vegetation is  under severe competition for light, water, and nutrients in  stands with high overstory density (Jameson 1967, Persson  1981, Riegel et al. 1995, Nabuurs 1996).  Understory plant species exhibit large differences in their  nutrient requirements (Grime 1977, Chapin et al. 1986,  Meerts 1997). Our results show that some understory species  in inland Northwest conifer stands increase in cover follow-ing  multinutrient fertilization while others do not or may even  decrease in cover. The shrubs (blueberry, common snow-berry,  Rocky mountain maple, rose, thimbleberry, and Utah  honeysuckle) the forbs (hawkweed, strawberry, and western  yarrow), and the grasses (blue wildrye, Columbia brome,  152 WJAF 17(3) 2002  Kentucky bluegrass, pinegrass, and western fescue) increased  in cover following fertilization at one or more sites. De-creases  in cover following fertilization occurred at one or  more sites for the shrubs blueberry, common snowberry,  rose, shiny-leaf spirea, and western serviceberry, for the  forbs Montana thermopsis, self-heal (Prunella vulgaris),  speedwell, and for pinegrass.  The largest increases in understory production were  seen in stands dominated by shade-intolerant overstory  species that have low overstory densities. However, over-story  tree total volume response to fertilization in the inland  Northwest is greatest over a basal area range of about 125  to 175 ft2/ac. (Moore et al. 1998). Our study shows that  understory response would be low in stands with high  priority for overstory fertilization.  An important issue for resource managers in the inland  Northwest is the presence of noxious weeds. Fertilization has  the potential to increase not only desirable but also undesir-able  understory species. In our study hawkweed generally  increased in cover. The species of hawkweed we encountered  were Hieracium albiflorum and H. albertinum rather than the  exotic, noxious members of this genus.  Conclusions  Our study suggests that little change in understory vegeta-tion  AP will occur following multinutrient fertilization in  stands with higher overstory tree density. Therefore, stands in  midelevation forests in the inland Northwest normally targeted  for operational fertilization to increase overstory growth may  not produce large increases in understory vegetation AP fol-lowing  treatments. The largest responses in understory vegeta-tion  AP following multinutrient fertilization should be in low  density overstory stands, dominated by shade-intolerant tree  species. The following individual species can be characterized  as responsive to multinutrient fertilization: the shrubs, com-mon  snowberry and thimbleberry; the forbs, hawkweed, straw-berry,  and western yarrow; and the grasses, Kentucky blue-grass,  slender hairgrass, and western fescue. We do not intend  to imply that only the plants listed above are responsive to  fertilization, merely that these plants showed increased growth  following treatment in our study.

ABSTRACT: Four controlled-release fertilizers (fast release [FR], moderate release [MR], slow release [SR]  and slow release with micronutrients extended [ME]) were applied, at rates of 0, 5, 15 and 30 g/seedling, to  ponderosa pine seedlings (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) immediately after planting. Compared to the controls,  the 5 and15 g/seedling of FR or ME fertilizer produced significantly greater caliper growth and the 5 and 15 g/  seedling of ME fertilizer and 15 and 30 g of FR fertilizer produced significantly greater height growth after 3 yr.  Mortality occurred mainly during the first growing season and varied substantially with fertilizer types and  dosage. High dosage (30 g/seedling) generally caused more mortality than other dosage levels. Seventy-eight, 54,  51, and 36% of total nutrients had been released from the FR, MR, SR and ME products, respectively, by late  August of the first growing season. Early in the second growing season, the FR product had released 98% of its  total nutrients, and the MR, SR, and ME products had released over 90% of their nutrients. The best fertilizer  treatment, 15 g of the ME product, produced a 21% diameter increase and a 30% height increase 3 yr after  treatment. The relative magnitude of the growth responses is similar to those observed from other adjacent  placement, controlled-release, seedling fertilization studies in the Northwest. West. J. Appl. For. 17(3):154–164.  Key Words: Controlled-release fertilizer, ponderosa pine.  Fertilizing seedlings at or near the time of planting to  enhance seedling growth and survival is an increasingly  common practice. Fertilization experiments have shown that  application of soluble inorganic fertilizers in new plantations  generally results in increased growth (Ballard 1978). How-ever,  some fertilization experiments in conifer plantations  also showed that soluble fertilizers increased mortality rates  and did not improve early growth (White 1960, Sutton 1982).  Increased mortality was primarily a consequence of the  osmotic effect of high salt concentrations in the rooting zone.  Poor seedling response to soluble fertilizers seemed related  to the inability of newly planted seedling root systems to use  large quantities of applied nutrients. Nutrient uptake by  competing vegetation as well as the movement of the applied  nutrients through the upper soil profile also contributed to  poor response (Brockley 1988).  Controlled-release or organic fertilizers were used in some  fertilization experiments (Arnott and Brett 1973) in order to  overcome the disadvantages of soluble inorganic fertilizers.

Copyright © 2002 by the Society of  American Foresters  The release rate of controlled-release fertilizers is determined  predominantly by the thickness and solubility characteristics  of the coating materials as well as temperature during release.  Tree growth response to controlled-release fertilizers varies  with nutrient formulations, release characteristics, application  rates, and fertilizer placement methods (Carlson and Preisig  1981). The three placement methods that have been commonly  used with planting time fertilization are: planting hole applica-tion,  adjacent application, and broadcast application. One  problem with broadcast application of fertilizer is the possibil-ity  of stimulating growth of competing vegetation compared  with either in-hole or adjacent placements. In New Zealand,  fertilizers applied at planting are placed in a slit approximately  15 cm from the seedling to stimulate tree growth and simulta-neously  avoid vegetation competition (Ballard 1978). This  placement method was used in our study.  Fertilization success with controlled-release fertilizers  depends on factors such as nutrient formulations, release  characteristics, application rates, placement methods and  their interaction with seedling stock type, climate, and soil.  Treatment effects have been measured in terms of tree growth,  mortality, nutrient loss, weed competition, and economical  and environmental feasibility. Extensive field tests of seed-ling  fertilization with controlled-release fertilizer applied at  planting are needed before appropriate prescriptions can be  WJAF 17(3) 2002 155  developed for inland Northwest forest conditions.  In 1996, a fertilization experiment was initiated at the time  of planting ponderosa pine on the University of Idaho Experi-mental  Forest using controlled-release fertilizers of various  release characteristics and nutrient formulations (Table 1). The  major objective of this study was to test the effects of adjacent  placement of four fertilizer products at various application  rates on ponderosa pine seedling survival, growth, and foliar  nutrient concentration. A secondary objective was to deter-mine  the release characteristics of the fertilizer products under  the environmental conditions at the experimental site.  Materials and Methods  Site Description  The experiment was located in Latah county in northern  Idaho at 46°51′N and 116°50′W, elevation 950 m. The study  site was clearcut in 1995 and slash-burned in the spring of  1996. It is characterized as Vassar Silt Loam soil which is 1.5  m deep. The habitat type is Abies grandis/Clitonia uniflora  (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968). In winter, the average  temperature is 0°C, and the average daily min. temperature is  –4°C. In summer, the average temperature is 17°C, with an  average daily max. temperature of 27°C. Located just out of  the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains, the summers  begin moist and gradually turn dry by mid-July and continue  mostly without appreciable rain through mid-September.  October brings an increasing chance of rainfall. As autumn  progresses into winter, the precipitation increases dramati-cally,  falling as either snow or rain. The total annual precipi-tation  is 763 mm. Of this, one-third usually falls in April  through September (Osborne and Appelgren 1996).  Applying foliar active herbicide (Roundup) prior to plant-ing  and then twice more during the study period controlled  competing vegetation. Vegetation control reduces extrane-ous  variation in the experiment and is an increasingly com-mon  treatment during plantation establishment.  Experimental Design and Treatments  A randomized complete block design was used with six  blocks per treatment on the 0.425 ha experimental site. Each  block included 13 square plots of size 8 by 8 m, in which 36  trees were planted at 1.3 by 1.3 m spacing. All ponderosa pine  seedlings (160/90 container stock type) planted for this study  were raised the previous year (1996) at the University of Idaho  Forest Research Nursery and were planted between May 22  and 24, 1996. Thirteen fertilization treatments, rates of 5, 15  and 30 g using four kinds of controlled-release fertilizers  (Table 1) and one control (no controlled-release fertilizer  applied), were randomly assigned to the 13 square plots.  Release rates of the four products are controlled by their  coating weights. Approximate nutrient release periods for  fertilizers tested in our study are 9, 12, and 15 months for fast  (FR), medium (MR), and slow (SR) release products, respec-tively.  Actual release rates vary according to temperature and  moisture conditions at the experimental site. A micronutrients  extended (ME) product that has quickly released micronutri-ents  outside the coating was also tested. The macronutrient  release rate for the ME product was similar to the slowest  release product in our study. The Scotts Company manufac-tured  all fertilizers used in this experiment. Fertilizers were  applied into a hole 15 cm deep and 8 cm away from the planting  point on the uphill side immediately after planting.  To monitor fertilizer release rate, 15 g of the four fertilizer  products were placed into sixty 25 by 5 cm fiberglass mesh  bags. The bags were labeled and randomly placed into 15 cm  deep slots midway on the sides of individual plots. Six bags  from each fertilizer product were collected every 2 months  for 2 yr and sent to Scotts Laboratories (Allentown, PA) for  analysis of nutrient release.  Field Sampling and Measurements  The response variables of interest were diameter at the root  collar, height, survival, and foliage nutrient concentrations.  Seedling height and diameter were measured at planting and in  late October of the 1996, 1997, and 1998 growing seasons.  Survival was surveyed biweekly throughout the first growing  season (1996) and was calculated for each plot as the percent-age  of live seedlings relative to the total number of seedlings  planted. At the end of each growing season, three fascicles of  fully matured needles located nearest the terminal bud were  removed from each interior seedling of a plot. Needles were  oven-dried at 70°C for 2 days and ground for chemical analy-sis.  Scotts Laboratories completed analyses for N, P, K, Ca,  Mg, B, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Mo, all of which were present in  the controlled-release fertilizer products. Foliar N was deter-mined  using a standard mico-Kjeldahl procedure. Phosphorus,  K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn were determined by inductively  coupled plasma (ICP) emission with digested plant tissue.  Soil moisture at 0–10, 11–20, and 21–40 cm and tempera-ture  at 10, 20, and 40 cm depths at six points distributed  uniformly across the trial were also monitored biweekly through-out  the first growing season to evaluate their potential impacts  on seedling growth and mortality. In November of 1998, nine  plots were selected systematically as sampling points for soil  chemical analysis. Sample locations were selected such that  they were unaffected by the fertilizers placed near the seed-lings.  In each plot, four 30 cm deep soil cores, one from each  quadrant, were taken and composited for soil pH, NO3  - -N,  extractable P, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe, soil K, Ca, and Mg analyses. Soil  pH was measured 1:1 in H2O. Nitrate was extracted with  Table 1.

Extractable K, Ca, and Mg (1 N ammonium acetate, pH 3.0)  were analyzed by ICP spetrometry. Phosphorus was determined  on a 2 g subsample of soil extracted with 12 mL of Bray’s solution  (Bray and Kurtz, 1945). Manganese, Zn, Cu, and Fe were ana-lyzed  by atomic absorption. Holmes Analytical Laboratories at  the University of Idaho conducted the soil chemical analyses.  Data Analysis  For growth response analysis, the average diameter and  height, based on the 16 interior seedlings from each plot, were  used for detecting fertilization effects. Plots with soil compac-tion  and herbicide damage symptoms were not included so as  to isolate nuisance error. Therefore, 49 plots (out of 78) were  considered for data analysis; the replicates for each treatment  were between three and six (mostly four). The resulting unbal-anced  experiment caused us to use a generalized linear mixed  model (GLML) with repeated measures to analyze diameter  and height response to various fertilization treatments:  Y blk trea blk trea t trea t  i j k  ijk = + i + ij + i ij + k + ij k + ijk  ( = ,..., ; = ,..., ; = ,..., )  μ × × ε  1 6 1 13 1 4  (1)  where Yijk is the average diameter or height for treatment j in  block i and at time k, μ is the grand mean, blki is the random  effect for block i, treaij is the fixed effect for treatment j in  block i, tk is a fixed repeated factor for time k, where 1  represents the planting time in the spring of 1996 and 2, 3, and  4 represent 1996, 1997, and 1998 fall measurements, respec-tively,  and εijk is the random error for treatment j in block i at  time k. In Equation (1) it is assumed that random effects, block  and error, have a variance component covariance structure.  The model resembles that of a randomized complete block  repeated measures (split-plot in time), where the main plot  error, blki × treaij, is used to test for the fixed treatment effect,  and the residual error, εijk, is used to test for the fixed effects  of time and time by treatment interaction. For foliar nutrient  concentration data, the same model and covariance structure  as (1) were employed except that k could take on values of 1,  2, or 3 (representing fall 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively).  Very few seedlings died on the experimental site during the  second and third years. Therefore, only the first-year mortal-ity  was analyzed by using the model:  Mij = μ + blki + treaij + εij (i = 1,..., 6; j = 1,...,13) (2)  where Mij is the percent mortality for treatment j in block i, and  other parameters are as defined previously in Equation (1). First-year  mortality within the upper 10 plots was unduly affected by  soil compaction, thus masking treatment effects. These plots  were not included (represented as missing values) in the analy-sis.  Herbicide damage occurred to some additional plots during  the second year of the experiment, and therefore the damage had  no effect on first-year mortality. Consequently, each treatment  had five or six replicates (blocks) available for mortality analy-sis.  Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of various  fertilizer products applied at different rates over time; therefore,  we tested a set of orthogonal contrasts of the least square means  for diameter, height, foliar nutrient concentration, and mortality.  All statistical computations were performed using PROC MIXED  of SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 1995).  Results  Statistical analyses details, including significance levels  and statistical estimates for factors in Equations (1) and (2),  are provided in Tables 2 and 3. In addition, two orthogonal  contrasts for the repeated factor were also employed to detect  the temporal change in foliar nutrient concentration.  Table 2.

Soil Cu  concentrations at the experimental site are low compared to  those observed by Carlson and Preisig (1981). The experi-mental  site experienced a very dry period from mid-July until  late September. Soil moistures at the 11-40 cm depth during  this period were below 25%, which may have slowed nutrient  release from the fertilizer prills. Soil temperature at the three  sampling depths remained at about 10° C throughout the  sampling period.  Height and Diameter  Controlled-release fertilizers applied at planting tended to  increase root-collar diameter and height growth of ponderosa  pine seedlings (Figures 2 and 3) compared with the control  (no fertilizer added); however, the statistical significance  varied with different products and application rates over  time. Fertilization had more effect on diameter (P = 0.07 for  the contrast, “CTR vs. [FR+MR+SR+ME]”) than on height  (P = 0.10 for the same contrast) (Table 2). The FR product  was more effective in increasing diameter growth than the  Table 3.

No statistical difference  (P &gt; 0.05) was found among MR, SR, and ME products (P =  0.33 and 0.14 for the contrasts, “MR vs. [SR+ME]” and “SR  vs. ME”, respectively). There was an overall dose linear trend  (P = 0.07) and an interaction of “SR vs. ME × Dose linear  trend” (P = 0.02) for diameter growth (Table 2). All dose  levels of FR and the 5 and 15 g of ME product significantly  improved diameter growth (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the  control (Figure 2).  For height growth, FR did not differ from the MR, SR, and  ME products as a whole (P = 0.13 for the contrast, “FR vs.  [MR+SR+ME]”). However, ME product was better than  either the MR or SR products (P = 0.01 and 0.06 for the  contrasts, “MR vs. [SR+ME]” and “SR vs. ME,” respec-tively)  (Table 2). Neither dose linear trend (P = 0.19) nor dose  quadratic trend (P = 0.20) was significant across the whole  experiment, even though the individual contrasts, “SR vs.  ME × Dose linear trend” (P = 0.03) and “SR vs. ME × Dose  quadratic trend” (P = 0.01) were statistically significant. All  dose levels (5, 15, and 30 g) of FR, the 30 g of MR or SR, and  the 5 and 15 g of ME products produced taller seedlings than  the control (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 3).  Mortality  The average mortality for the controls was 4.2%, but ranged  from 1 to 12.8% for the fertilization treatments (Figure 4).  There was no significant difference between the control and  the fertilization treatments as a group (P = 0.67 for the contrast,  “CTR vs. [FR+MR+SR+ME]”). The FR product resulted in  higher mortality than MR, SR, and ME products as a group (P  = 0.06 for the contrast, “FR vs. [MR+SR+ME]”) (Table 3). The  ME product had lower mortality than the SR product (P = 0.77  for the contrast, “SR vs. ME”). Although the linear and  quadratic dosage trends for overall fertilizer types were not  statistically significant, the dosage effect on mortality was  evident for some individual fertilizer types such as FR and SR  (Figure 4). Mortality appeared to increase with dosage for the  158 WJAF 17(3) 2002  ME fertilizer (Figure 4). During the first growing season, dead  (brown) needle tips were observed for ponderosa pine seed-lings  treated with ME fertilizer, and the frequency of foliar  damage was higher and symptoms more severe with higher  dosages. No dead needle tips were observed on new growth in  the second or third growing seasons. Only mortality associated  with the 30 g of FR product (12.8%) statistically differed from  the control (P = 0.05).  Foliar Nutrient Concentrations  Foliar K, Ca, Mg, B, and Zn concentrations showed  significant overall treatment effects. Many pairwise com-parisons  were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) for these  elements. Foliar N, P, Fe, Cu, and Mn concentrations did not  show significant treatment effects.  Temporal change in foliar nutrient concentration was ob-served  for all nutrients except Fe. The yearly changes for foliar  N, P, Mg, B, Cu, Zn and Mn concentrations were significant for  both “first year vs. second year + third year” and “second year  vs. third year” (P &lt; 0.05); while for K and Ca the first contrast  was not significant. Significant interactions of treatment by  year were found for P, Ca, B, Cu, and Mn (P &lt; 0.05).  The estimated least square mean for foliar N concentration  decreased each sample year (Table 5). Foliar Ca and Cu  concentrations decreased from 1996 to 1997 and then in-creased  from 1997 to 1998. Foliar Fe concentration remained  relatively unchanged over the years. Foliar K concentration  in 1998 was lower than in 1996 and 1997. Foliar Mg concen-tration  increased over years for most treatments. Foliar Mn  concentration changed little from 1996 to 1997, but increased  dramatically during 1998. Foliar macronutrient concentra-tions  for all treatments in each sample year were well above  critical levels (Powers 1983, Powers 1985). Foliar B, Cu, and  Fe were deficient for most or all of the fertilization treatments  based on the critical values suggested by Powers 1983,  Powers 1985, and Boyer 1984 (unpublished). First year foliar  B concentrations of ponderosa pine seedlings were extraor-dinarily  increased by the ME fertilizer and reached concen-trations  over 250 ppm (Table 6).  Fertilizer Nutrient Release  Over the period from June 10 to August 26, 1996, approxi-mately  78, 54, 51, and 36% of total nutrients had been  released from the FR, MR, SR, and ME fertilizers, respec-tively.  By October 26, 1996, the nutrients released from the  FR, MR, SR, and ME fertilizers on average amounted to 86,  70, 55 and 39% of total nutrients. By July 8, 1997 (the 55th  week after placement), the FR fertilizer released 98% of its  total nutrients, and the MR, SR, and ME fertilizers released  90% of their nutrients (Figure 5).  Discussion  Overall, the fertilizer treatments produced larger seed-lings  than the controls after 3 yr (Figures 2 and 3). Several of  the fertilizer treatments were also significantly different from  each other after 3 yr. Based on final diameters and heights of  ponderosa pine seedlings in this study, FR and ME fertilizers  Figure 1.

The 5 g and 15 g doses  were generally better than the 30 g dose. The seedlings from  the ME-15 treatment were largest, with an average diameter  of 26.7 mm and height of 90.6 cm compared to control  treatment diameter of 22.1 mm and height of 69.6 cm. The  ME-15 treatment also had lower mortality than the control  (Figure 4). The somewhat better performance of the ME  fertilizer, at least for the two lower doses, may be related to  the product’s slower field release rate (Figure 5) perhaps  resulting in greater nutrient availability during the second and  possibly third growing season. However, this explanation is  not reflected in foliar nutrient concentrations over the 3 yr  period (Table 5).  Approximately 86, 70, 55, and 39% of the nutrients had  been released from the FR, MR, SR, and ME products, respec-tively  (Figure 5), by the end of the first growing season. By  early in the second growing season, more than 90% of the  nutrients had been released for all products. Thus, these prod-ucts  extend the nutrient release period by about a year for our  experimental conditions compared to soluble inorganic fertil-izers.  However, substantial nutrient release, particularly from  the ME and SR fertilizers, occurred during the snow-covered  160 WJAF 17(3) 2002  winter (from week 24 to week 37), while trees were in  dormancy. Thus, the nutrients may have leached lower in  the soil profile and became unavailable to the seedling  root systems.  Growth increases 3 yr following treatment were “notice-able”  and statistically significant but not “dramatic.” Close  inspection of foliar nutrient concentrations may greatly ex-plain  our experimental results. All treatments, including the  controls, had foliar concentrations well above critical levels  for all nutrients except B, Cu, and Fe. The fertilizer treat-ments  did not increase B, Cu, and Fe concentrations, except  for elevated B concentrations following the ME treatments.  Three alternative, or perhaps complementary, explanations  suggest themselves from these data. The control seedlings  had adequate nutrient supplies, particularly of the macronu-trients;  thus the fertilizer treatments did not produce substan-tial  response. Our seedling quality was excellent and seed-lings  experienced “nutrient loading” in the nursery prior to  planting. Seedling macronutrient foliar concentrations were  still well above critical levels for the controls after 3 yr in the  field. If seedling nutrient levels had been lower, fertilization  response may have been higher than what we observed.  Alternatively, B, Cu, and Fe concentrations were below  critical levels, and the treatments failed to alleviate these  deficiencies, except B for the ME product. Perhaps increased  B levels explain the improved growth performance of ME-5  and 15 treated seedlings. Another explanation could be that  little of the macro-nutrients delivered by the fertilizers were  Figure 3.

Managers should be aware of one additional result pro-duced  by the ME product. Since the micronutrients are on the  outside of the resin coating, they are rapidly released following  treatment application. Seedling mortality increased with dos-age  increase of ME fertilizer (Figure 4) possibly due to boron  toxicity. Foliar boron concentrations increased about tenfold  by the end of the first growing season and reached over 250  Table 5.

These ponderosa pine  seedlings showed burned needle tips during the first growing  season, one symptom of B toxicity. The frequency of foliar  damage was higher and symptoms more severe with higher  dosages. The 30 g dose seems too high for this product. In fact,  the 30 g rate is probably too high for all of these fertilizers since  mortality was higher for the FR and SR products, given this  dose, while diameter and height for the MR product were  smaller than the controls after three growing seasons.  WJAF 17(3) 2002 163  The 30% height growth response produced after three  growing seasons by our best treatment (ME-15) is surprisingly  similar to relative height growth responses observed in other  adjacent placement, controlled-release, seedling fertilization  studies conducted in northwestern North America. For ex-ample,  Carlson and Preisig (1981) showed about 42% height  growth response after 2 yr for Douglas-fir in western Oregon,  while Van den Driessche (1988) demonstrated a 31% height  increase after 6 yr for Douglas-fir in coastal British Columbia.  Adjacent placement of Osmocote produced a height increase  of only 11% for western hemlock after two growing seasons in  western Washington (Carlson 1981). However, placement of  the same fertilizer in the planting hole resulted in a 30% height  increase for hemlock in the same study. The above studies,  including ours, represent a wide array of site conditions, tree  species, and somewhat different fertilizer formulations and  application rates. Therefore, the consistent seedling relative  growth response is remarkable and perhaps comforting, al-though  some managers may have higher expectations. A  reasonable expectation for response seems to be about a 30%  height growth increase following adjacent placement of con-trolled-  release fertilizers after planting.  Conclusions  The best fertilizer treatment, 15 g of the ME product,  produced a 21% diameter increase and a 30% height increase  3 yr after treatment. The relative magnitude of the growth  responses is consistent with those observed from other adja-cent  placement, controlled-release, seedling fertilization stud-ies  in the Northwest. While the magnitude of response was  statistically significant, the response may not be “operationally  significant.” Given the environmental conditions of our ex-periment,  managers may not consider ponderosa pine seedling  fertilization at the time of planting to be an attractive financial  investment. We feel two factors, either singly or in combina-tion,  contributed to the lack of a more substantial growth  response. First, macronutrient foliar concentrations for control  ponderosa pine seedlings were well above critical levels for  each of the 3 yr. Second, B, Cu, and Fe foliar concentrations  were generally below critical levels during the study period,  and the fertilizer treatments did not alleviate these deficiencies,  except B for the ME product. The 30 g/seedling dose is too high  for all the fertilizers we tested, given that we used 160/90  ponderosa pine container seedlings in our experiment.  Literature Cited  ARNOTT, J.T., AND C.P.

ABSTRACT: Three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release [FR], moderate release [MR], and slow release  [SR]) were incorporated in the root plug at rates of 0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 g/seedling at the time of sowing as  supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on seedling growth, survival, and foliar nutrient  status of the “160/90” container ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) were evaluated after outplanting. At the end  of the second growing season, fertilized seedlings had significantly greater diameter and height than  unfertilized seedlings. The 3.2 g of MR or SR fertilizer treatments produced significantly higher mortality (55  and 36%, respectively) than the controls. The fast release fertilizer included at a rate of 0.8 g in each seedling’s  container was the preferred treatment since it produced good survival and seedling growth response. A 2-yr  growth response of about 25% was similar to that observed in a nearby study using adjacent placement of  controlled-release fertilizer after planting ponderosa pine seedlings. West. J. Appl. For. 17(4):216–219.  Key Words: Fertilizer, Pinus ponderosa, seedling growth.  Initial fertilizer toxicity and later deficiency in seedlings and  most factors contributing to loss of efficiency in seedling  fertilization are directly related to rapid dissolution and  hydrolysis of the applied fertilizers. Controlled-release fertil-izers  may be considered as potential solutions to the problem,  because they provide a continuous supply of nutrients over an  extended period of time. Brockley (1988) discussed the  potential for incorporating controlled-release fertilizers in  the root plug of containerized seedlings for stimulating green-house  and field growth performance and simplifying fertil-izer  operations. However, the reported results were not con-sistent.  The release characteristics, relative nutrient propor-tions,  and application rates of controlled-release fertilizers  (Patel and Sharma 1977), and their interaction with stock  type (Brockley 1988) have been identified as priorities for  future research.  Our study’s objective was to evaluate the effect of three  controlled-release fertilizers and several application rates on  ponderosa pine seedling survival and growth. We established  a fertilization experiment with three controlled-release fertil-izers  characterized by various release rates and nutrient pro-portions  incorporated in the root plugs of container-grown  NOTE: James A.

Seedlings were then planted on the  University of Idaho Experimental Forest in April 1997. Spe-cifically,  the study addressed the following questions: (1)  What are the differences in growth and survival between  fertilized and unfertilized ponderosa pine seedlings? and (2)  How are survival and growth affected by fertilizer types and  dosage? Based on the answers to the questions above, we make  recommendations on fertilizer products and dosages.  Materials and Methods  Plant Materials, Controlled-Release Fertilizers, and  Growing Environment  The Scotts Company provided the three types of con-trolled-  release fertilizers (Table 1) tested in this study. Each  type of three controlled-release fertilizers, corresponding to  0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 g/seedling application rates, was first fully  mixed into the 50/50% peat-vermiculite growing media. The  container cells were then hand filled with the mixture of  growing media and fertilizers on February 24, 1996. No  controlled-release products were incorporated in the growing  media for the control treatments. The experiment included  ten fertilizer treatments (three products × three rates and one  control). Seedlings were grown at the University of Idaho  Forest Research Nursery. The containers used for growing  ponderosa pine seedlings were 160/90 (160 cavities/con-tainer,  90 cm3/cavity). Ponderosa pine seeds, collected from  natural stands in northern Idaho within the same seed transfer  WJAF 17(4) 2002 217  zone as the planting site, were sown at three seeds/cell with  a vacuum seeder and covered with about 0.6 cm of Target  Forestry Sandon March 1. Once sowing was complete, the  containers were irrigated until the media was thoroughly  moist. Phosphoric acid was injected into the irrigation water  to adjust pH to around 6.0. On the growing bed, containers  were arranged according to a completely randomized design  with four replicates (containers). The seed germination pro-cess  was completed by March 22, and cells were then thinned  to one seedling when most seedlings shed their seed coats.  During the growth phase (from March to June), day tempera-tures  of 24–27°C and night temperatures around 18°C were  maintained. Photoperiod was extended to 24 hr in the green-house.  In addition to the fertilization treatments, the regular  nursery-based liquid fertilizer solution was also applied dur-ing  twice-weekly irrigations through an overhead traveling  boom system. Top dressing rates and nutrient compositions  for the regular nursery regime were adjusted based on seed-ling  growth phases. Wenny and Dumroese (1987) describe  the growing regime for ponderosa pine in detail.  Seedlings were lifted, wrapped with plastic in bundles of  20, and placed into polylined wax boxes with treatment labels  on December 1, and stored at 0.5°C, with relative humidity  near 100% before planting in April of the next year.  Site Description  The experiment was located in Latah Co. in northern  Idaho at 46°51′N and 116°50′W., elev. 950 m. The Vassar  Silt Loam soil at the site is 1.5 m deep. The habitat type is  Abies grandis/Clitonia uniflora (Daubenmire and Daubenmire  1968). In winter, the average temperature is 0°C, and the  average daily minimum temperature is –4°C. In summer, the  average temperature is 17°C, and the average daily maximum  temperature is 27°C. Located just out of the rain shadow of  the Cascade Mountains, the summers begin moist and gradu-ally  turn dry by mid-July and continue mostly without appre-ciable  rain through mid-September. October has an increas-ing  chance of rainfall. As autumn progresses into winter, the  precipitation increases dramatically falling as either snow or  rain. The total annual precipitation is 763 mm. Of this, one-third  usually falls in April through September (Osborne and  Appelgren 1996). The study site was clearcut in 1995 and  slash-burned in the spring of 1996.  Experimental Design and Treatments  A randomized complete block design was used on the 0.4  ha experimental site to study the effect of nursery-applied  root-plug incorporated controlled-release fertilizers on growth  and survival of ponderosa pine seedlings. The experiment  consisted of 6 blocks. In each block, 36 ponderosa pine  seedlings from each of the 10 greenhouse treatments were  assigned randomly to a square plot of size 8 by 8m with trees  planted at 1.3 by 1.3 m spacing. All seedlings were planted  between April 20 and 22, 1997.  Field Sampling and Measurements  The potential variation in soil, seedling quality, and the  amount of fertilizer incorporated in the root plug were  considered in the design. Thus we used square plots as  sampling units rather than individual seedlings to investi-gate  seedling response to fertilization treatments. The  response variables of interest were mean diameter at the  root collar, height, and survival. Seedling height and  diameter were measured at planting and at the end of each  growing season (November). Survival was surveyed bi-weekly  throughout the first growing season and at the end  of the second growing season. It was calculated for each  plot as the percentage of living seedlings of the total  number of planted seedlings.  Data Analysis  A generalized linear mixed model (GLML) with re-peated  measures was employed for analyzing diameter  and height response to the fertilization treatments as  follows:  Y blk trea t trea t  i j k  ijk = + i + ij + k + ij k + ijk  ( = , .., ; = ,.. , ; = , .., )  μ × ε  1 6 1 10 1 3  (1)  where Yijk is the diameter or height mean for treatment j in  block i and at time k, μ is the grand mean, blki is the random  effect for block i, treaij is the fixed effect for treatment j in  block i, tk is a fixed and repeated factor for time (year) k (1  represents the planting time and 2 and 3 represent fall  measurements of 1997 and 1998, respectively), and εijk is  the random error effect for treatment j in block i and at time  k. Because mortality predominately occurred during the  first growing season, we only analyzed the first-year data  to reveal survival patterns among treatments using GLML  as follows:  S blk trea  i j  ij = + i + ij + ij  ( = , .., ; = ,.. , )  μ ε  1 6 1 10  (2)  where Sij is the survival for treatment j in block i, and the other  terms are as defined in Equation (1). Regression analysis of  2nd-yr diameter and height, and 1st-yr survival as related to  fertilizer dosage was performed using a parabolic model. The  estimated fertilizer dosage associated with maximum diam-eter,  height, and survival for each type of fertilizer was  calculated using differentiation. All statistical computations  were performed using PROC MIXED and PROC REG of  SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 1995).  Table 1.

Signifi-cance  was primarily derived from the overall fertilization  effect contrasted with controls (P = 0.0001). All fertiliza-tion  treatments differed from the controls (P &lt; 0.05) (Table  2). Two years after outplanting, diameter and height re-sponse  to 1.6 g of all three products and 0.8 g of FR were  nearly identical.  The estimated dosage for achieving maximum diameter  following two field growing seasons was 1.96, 1.84, and 1.84  g for FR, MR, and SR products, respectively. Similarly, 1.86,  2.02, and 2.06 g produced maximum height response for FR,  MR, and SR products, respectively.  Survival  Seedling mortality mainly occurred during the first grow-ing  season, particularly during the first 2 months (May and  June) after planting. During this period, overall mortality  dramatically increased, reaching 10.3% by the end of June.  Subsequently, mortality increased slowly and reached 14%  by the end of October. Very few seedlings (1.4%) died during  the second growing season.  Seedling survival varied significantly among fertilization  treatments (Table 3). Overall survival of fertilized seedlings  was lower than the controls (P = 0.0001). Fertilizer type and  dosage, as well as their interaction, had significant effects on  seedling survival. FR fertilizer produced higher survival than  SR fertilizer, and SR fertilizer produced higher survival than  MR fertilizer. This was especially true with the 3.2 g dosage.  Based on the estimated parabolic model, the dose for achiev-ing  maximum survival was 1.34 g/seedling for MR fertilizer.  For FR or SR fertilizer, the dose was 0.8 g, the lowest  application rate tested in this study.  Discussion  Significant diameter and height growth of fertilized seed-lings  in this study supports the idea that incorporating con-trolled-  release fertilizers in the root plug of container-grown  ponderosa pine seedlings could be an efficient way to stimu-late  growth while eliminating field fertilization of seedlings  at planting. Ponderosa pine seedling growth responses were  closely related to the characteristics of the three fertilizer  products. The release periods for FR, MR, and SR products  were preformulated as 9, 12 to 14, and 18 to 20 months,  respectively. In the greenhouse, the 3.2 g/seedling rate of FR  fertilizer was too high for the “160/90” seedlings due to the  fast release characteristic of this product and the relatively  small volume (90 cm3) of these containers.  Continuous nutrient release and high salinity buildup and  toxicity during 4 months of cold storage may have affected  survival in our study similar to the results reported by Brockley  (1988). The dramatic decline in survival associated with the  3.2 g rate, particularly for the MR product 1 yr after planting  (Table 3), was probably caused by nutrient toxicity that  occurred during cold storage. Necrotic needle tips were  observed within 2 wk of planting for the highest rate of  medium and slow release products. We did not find necrotic  needle tips for other fertilization treatments.  Mortality of planted seedlings mainly occurred within the  first 2 months after planting with the high dosage of MR and  SR fertilizers. The high field mortality with 3.2 g of MR or SR  treatments was totally due to dead root plugs which was  strongly related to the release characteristics of the two  products. Unlike FR fertilizer, both MR and SR fertilizer had  a longer release cycle than the nine-month greenhouse pro-duction  cycle. We observed that 9.2 and 4.4% by weight of  nutrients were released from MR and SR fertilizers during  cold storage. It is unclear if this magnitude of release com-pletely  explains our mortality results. Alternatively, the seed-lings  were “hardened-off” by reducing moisture near the end  of the nursery growing regime. This may have produced  Table 2.

Perhaps  higher mortality for the 3.2 g of MR or SR treatments resulted  from both the nutrient release during cold storage and the  higher root zone salt concentrations. Whatever the reason,  the 3.2 g of MR or SR treatments produced unacceptably high  mortality rates.  The preferred treatment would probably be 0.8 g of the  FR product since it produced good survival, about the same  growth increase as other fertilizer treatments, and it pre-sumably  costs less than higher rates per seedling. The 0.8 g  of FR product increased diameter about 23% and height  about 25% after two field growing seasons. This response is  similar to the relative growth increase observed from adja-cent  placement of controlled-release fertilizers just after  planting in a nearby study under similar environmental  conditions (Fan et al. 2001).  Conclusions  Fertilizer placed in the root plug of container grown  ponderosa pine significantly increased both diameter and  height after 2 growing seasons. Diameter and height of  ponderosa pine seedlings without fertilizer incorporated in  the root plug averaged 16.6 mm and 43.2 cm, while seed-lings  with fertilizer incorporated in the root plug ranged  from 18.4 to 20.7 mm and from 49.1 to 55.4 cm, for diameter  and height, respectively. No significant growth differences  between fertilizer type and no interaction of fertilizer type  by dosage were detected.  Ponderosa pine mortality mainly occurred within the  first 2 months after planting. Incorporating 3.2 g of MR or  SR fertilizer in the root plug produced significantly higher  mortality (54 and 36%, respectively). Lower dosages did  not significantly affect survival. The preferred treatment  was 0.8 g of fast release fertilizer per seedling.  The best treatment produced growth response similar to  adjacent placement of controlled-release fertilizer just after  planting ponderosa pine seedlings in a nearby study area.  Incorporating fertilizers in the growing media of container  nurseries eliminates the cost of fertilizer field applications.  These cost savings may compare favorably with the in-creased  seedling production costs required to include con-trolled-  release fertilizer in the growing media for container  nurseries.

Dans cette re-cherche,  nous avons étudié les effets de la génétique et de l’environnement sur la chimie de l’écorce des racines de  20 familles de douglas de Menzies âgés de 15 ans et plantés à deux endroits dans le nord de l’Idaho.

Les interactions entre les familles et les sites  étaient significatives pour la concentration de tous les composés mesurés dans l’écorce des racines de même que pour  le rapport composés phénoliques/sucres. Les corrélations phénotypiques entre la hauteur et le rapport composés phéno-liques/  sucres et entre la hauteur et la concentration de sucres n’étaient pas significatives. Cependant, des familles avec  une croissance en hauteur supérieure et une concentration de sucres inférieure à la moyenne étaient présentes dans les  deux sites. Même si un rapport composés phénoliques/sucres élevé s’avère efficace pour sélectionner des génotypes ré-sistants  à l’infection par Armillaria, les résultats montrent que des gains pourraient être obtenus plus efficacement en  sélectionnant pour une faible concentration en sucre.  [Traduit par la Rédaction] Myszewski et al. 560  Introduction  Several studies have suggested a link between Armillaria  infection rates and variation in root bark chemistry. Species  with higher phenolics/sugar ratios in the root bark tend to be  less susceptible to Armillaria infection than those with lower  ratios (Entry et al. 1991a, 1992). Likewise, within a single  species, stands with higher ratios of phenolics to sugars tend  to be less susceptible to disease and insects than stands with  low phenolics/sugar ratios (Entry et al. 1991b, 1994; Dudt  and Shure 1994).  If variation in root bark chemistry is indeed linked to  Armillaria susceptibility and it is at least partially controlled  by genetics, it may be possible to decrease susceptibility in  planted stands of species like Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga  menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) by selectively breeding for favor-able  chemical attributes. Should these favorable chemical at-  Can. J. For.

The objectives of this study were (i) to de-termine  whether differences in root bark chemistry, in par-ticular  differences in the concentrations of sugars, phenolics,  and the phenolics/sugar ratio, are genetically controlled in  Douglas-fir and (ii) to examine the relationship between  height growth and root bark chemistry.  Methods  Two Inland Empire Tree Improvement Cooperative  (IETIC) Douglas-fir progeny tests were sampled in this  study. Both are located in northern Idaho in the midelevation  (915–1219 m) breeding zone for Douglas-fir and both are on  Thuja plicata Donn. ex D. Don – Paxistima myrsinites  (Pursh) Raf. habitat types (Daubenmire and Daubenmire  1968). The Rimrock test (48°26¢N, 116°47¢W) is located  near the Priest River Experimental Forest, southeast of  Coolin, Idaho (Fins and Rust 1997). It has an a mean eleva-tion  of 1143 m and a west to northwest aspect. The Bussel  Creek test (47°05¢N, 116°09¢W) is located northeast of  Clarkia, Idaho. It has a mean elevation of 1189 m and a  southern aspect.  Rimrock and Bussel Creek were established as sister tests  to evaluate long-term progeny field performance. A third sis-ter  test was also established, but with the exception of 12-  year height measurements, it is not included in this study.  Each site contains progeny of the same 260 families from  eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana.  In 1981, one-year-old container seedlings were planted in  the tests at 1.5 × 1.5 m spacing. Families were randomly as-signed  to one of five sets. Family members were distributed  in three blocks, each containing randomized, noncontiguous,  nine-tree plots, (27 test trees per family per site) (Fins  1983). “Family”, in this case, refers to the open-pollinated  progeny of a single, identified parent tree. Parent trees were  naturally regenerated Douglas-fir in undomesticated stands  and were phenotypically selected in 1979 for superior  growth and form characteristics. The progeny in set 1, which  included 59 families, were selected for use in this study be-cause  of high survival (90%) and fairly low damage (14%)  across sites relative to the other sets. The 20 families exam-ined  in this study were selected, because they had been in-cluded  in an earlier IETIC study relating foliar nutrient  concentrations and height growth (Walker 1995).  Samples of inner root bark tissue were collected from 5 to  11 members of each family at each site. Mortality in the  progeny tests prior to sampling prevented the use of a bal-anced  design so samples were taken irrespective of block.  Samples were collected during the first 3 days of October  1993 at Bussel Creek and from late September to early Oc-tober  1994 at Rimrock. The root collar of each sampled tree  was uncovered until two roots with a minimum diameter of  1.27 cm were exposed. Then, a 3.81 × 7.62 cm rectangular  section of inner root bark tissue was removed from each  root. Samples were taken approximately 20–30 cm below  the root collar and, wherever possible, from opposite sides  of the tree. When only smaller (&lt;1.27 cm diameter) roots  were uncovered, two roots were clipped and sections of bark  comparable in size with the chiseled samples were peeled  from the roots. In some instances, this resulted in girdling of  the root pieces. For two trees, only one root large enough to  provide a sample was found so samples were taken from op-posite  sides of the same root. Samples were transported from  the field in coolers and stored at –15°C at the College of  Natural Resources, University of Idaho, Moscow, until April  1995. Samples were then divided into two batches (10 fami-lies  each) to facilitate laboratory schedules and submitted for  analysis to the Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washing-ton  State University, Pullman. The first set of samples was  analyzed in December 1995; the second was done in August  1996. Sugar concentrations were determined according to  the methods of Hansen and Moller (1975). Phenolics were  extracted using the methods of Julkunen-Tiitto (1985).  In 1992, total tree height was measured at the three sister  tests. Because of the negative correlations between height  and previous damage, only values from trees expressing no  signs of root rot were used to calculate the percentile height  rankings for each family, and only values from trees with no  history of damage were used to calculate heritabilities.  A randomized block design with a statistical model con-taining  family, site, and the family × site interaction terms  was applied to estimate genetic and environmental effects on  root bark chemistry. To account for uneven sample sizes (5–  11 trees per family per site), a general linear model analysis  of variance (PROC GLM; SAS Institute Inc. 1990b) was  used to identify significant sources of variation in the indi-vidual  root compounds and in the phenolics/sugar ratio. The  “test” option was used to treat all variables as random ef-fects.  Family and site means were calculated using the  PROC MEANS procedure and phenotypic correlations were  calculated using PROC CORR (SAS Institute Inc. 1990a).  Variance components and coefficients for the heritability  estimates and the genetic correlations were calculated using  PROC VARCOMP (SAS Institute Inc. 1990b). Family and  single-tree narrow-sense heritabilities were estimated using  equations adapted from those in Zobel and Talbert (1991)  for estimating heritability in half-sib tests:  [1] hi  fam  fam fam site error  2  2  2 2 2  = 3  + ´ +  s  s s s  [2] h  s ts fam  fam  fam fam site error  2  2  2 2 2 =  + ´ +  s  s (s / ) (s / )  where hi  2 is the single-tree narrow-sense heritability, hfam  2 is  the family mean heritability, sfam  2 is the family variance  component, sfam´site  2 is the family × site interaction variance  component, serror  2 is the tree within families (error) variance  component, s is the coefficient representing the number of  sites, and t is the coefficient representing the number of trees  per family. When calculating hi  2 , a coefficient of relationship  equal to 3 was used in place of 4, because the families in-cluded  in this study were open pollinated and, therefore,  probably not true half-sib families (i.e., some of the progeny  within the families may be full-sibs or even selfs).  Results and discussion  The site mean phenolics/sugar ratios (5.36 at Bussel  Creek and 4.85 at Rimrock; Table 1) in our study were lower  © 2002 NRC Canada  Myszewski et al. 557  than those reported by Entry et al. (1991b) for stands of  Douglas-fir. Foliar nutrient data (on file with the IETIC)  suggest that the site mean ratios may be low as a result of  nutrient deficiencies. Over 75% of the trees sampled at  Bussel Creek had foliar N levels below those considered ad-equate  for Douglas-fir in the Inland Northwest (Garrison and  Moore 1998). Entry et al. (1991a) found that trees grown  with limited N tend to have lower phenolics/sugar ratios  than trees grown with adequate amounts of N.  Another possible factor in finding low site mean  phenolics/sugar ratios is higher than expected sugar concen-trations.  Mean sugar concentrations were 4.40 and  4.23 g/100 g root bark tissue at Bussel Creek and Rimrock,  respectively. These are over 33% higher than the sugar con-centrations  of 3.0 reported by Moore et al. (2000) for  thinned stands of naturally regenerated Douglas-fir growing  on T. plicata habitat types in the interior northwestern  United States. In that study, the mean phenolics/sugar ratio  was 6.7.  Seasonal variation in root bark chemistry may also con-tribute  to the low phenolics/sugar ratios. Nerg et al. (1994)  found that phenolics concentrations in Pinus sylvestris L.  shoots are significantly lower in September than in spring.  Similarly, Nozzolillo et al. (1990) found that phenolics in  Pinus banksiana Lamb. needles were lower in the autumn  months than in winter. Root sugar concentrations, by con-trast,  are higher during the autumn months. In Pinus elliottii  Engelm., sugar concentrations in fine roots are lowest in  spring, then increase from late summer to winter (Gholz and  Cropper 1991). Likewise, coarse root sugars in Acer  saccharum Marsh. are highest in August through October  (Liu and Tyree 1997). These studies suggest that the  phenolics/sugar ratio would be at its lowest in fall, poten-tially  making the trees most susceptible to Armillaria during  that time.  Site differences in phenolics, and the phenolics/sugar ra-tios  were highly significant (Table 2). Within sites, family  differences in phenolics and the phenolics/sugar ratio were  also highly significant. However, because of significant  family × site interactions, family differences were not signif-icant  across sites. We suspect that genetic differences in  phenolics concentrations and in the phenolics/sugar ratio re-ally  do exist across locations, but the prevalence of nutrient  deficiencies within the test sites, the fact that sites were sam-pled  in different years and the fact that roots were sampled  when the phenolics/sugar ratios are likely to have been low  may have hindered our ability to detect them.  The phenotypic correlation between phenolic concentra-tions  and 12-year height growth was positive (Table 3),  which appears to contradict traditional hypotheses regarding  carbon allocation (Herms and Mattson 1992). However, sev-eral  other studies have found positive relationships between  growth and defense compounds as well (e.g., Briggs and  Schultz 1990; Kimball et al. 1999). One explanation is that  nitrogen deficiencies at the progeny test sites are limiting  growth, making carbon available for phenol and tannin pro-  © 2002 NRC Canada  558 Can. J. For. Res.

Studies have shown that this carbon allocation pat-tern  can occur without noticeable impact on growth when  environmental resources limit growth (Bryant et al. 1985;  Larsson et al. 1986; Mihaliak and Lincoln 1989). However,  when adequate resources are available, carbon allocation  shifts towards growth, and little carbon is available for de-fense  compounds (Bazzaz et al. 1987).  Single-tree and family heritability estimates were moder-ately  high for 12-year height growth (0.40 and 0.61, respec-tively).  These values are higher than heritability estimates  for 8-year height growth in the same 20 families (0.27 and  0.54, respectively) (Walker 1995), but the narrow-sense  heritability estimate for 12-year height growth is consistent  with values reported by Campbell (1972) for height in  coastal Douglas-fir.  Single-tree and family heritability estimates were also  moderately high for sugar concentration (0.48 and 0.60, re-spectively).  Wargo (1980, 1981) found that when glucose  concentrations are low, defense compounds such as phenols  and tannins inhibit fungal growth and can be toxic to  Armillaria. However, when glucose concentrations are high,  Armillaria is capable of oxidizing defense compounds and  using them as a carbon source (Wargo 1980, 1981). Thus,  sugar concentration may be the key component of the  phenolics/sugar ratio.  Because the phenotypic correlation between 12-year  height and sugar concentrations was small (0.09) and not  significant, it was possible to identify five families with su-perior  height growth (&gt;70th percentile) and below-average  sugar concentrations at both test sites. With moderately high  heritabilities for both traits and a negative genetic correlation  (–0.18) between the two, selection for relatively low sugar  concentration among families with above-average height  growth could potentially decrease susceptibility to  Armillaria sp. while at least maintaining or even increasing  height growth in Douglas-fir in northern Idaho.

Nitrogen Uptake and Turnover in Riparian Woody Vegetation: A 15N Tracer Experiment,"Chambers, C.S.","The nutrient balance of streams and adjacent riparian ecosystems may have been modified by the elimination of anadromous fish runs and perhaps by forest fertilization. To better understand nitrogen dynamics within stream and riparian ecosystems, and the nitrogen transfer between them, we fertilized two streams and their adjacent riparian corridors in central Idaho. On each stream two nitrogen doses were applied to a swathe approximately 35 m wide centered on the stream. The fertilizer N was enriched in 15N to 18%. This enrichment is light relative to many previous labeling studies, yet sufficient to yield a traceable signal in riparian and stream biota. This paper reports pre-treatment differences in ?15N and the first-year N response to fertilizer within the riparian woody plant community. Future manuscripts will describe the transfer of allochthonous litter N to the stream and its subsequent processing by stream biota. Pre-treatment ?15N differed between the two creeks (p = 0.00016), possibly due to residual salmon nitrogen on one of the creeks. Pre-treatment ?15N of current-year needles was enriched compared to leaf litter, which was in turn enriched compared to needles aged 4 years and older. This leads us to conclude that fractionation due to retranslocation occurs in two phases. The first, which optimizes allocation of N in younger needle age classes, is distinctly different from the second, which conserves N prior to abscission. The ?15N difference between creeks was eliminated by the fertilization (p = 0.42). In the two dominant conifer species, Abies lasiocarpa and Picea engelmannii, most fertilizer N was found in the current-year foliage; little was found in older needles and none was detected in litter (p = 0.53). In the only N-fixing shrub species, Alnus incana, little fertilizer N was detected (mean percent N derived from fertilizer (%Ndff) 5.0 � 1.6% (se)). Far more fertilizer N was taken up by other deciduous shrubs (mean %Ndff = 33.9 � 4.5%).  Fertilizer N made up 25 (� 4.2%) of the N in deciduous shrub litter. These results demonstrate the importance of pre-treatment measurements, the feasibility of light labeling with 15N, and the potential influence of riparian plant species composition on stream nutrient dynamics via allochthonous leaf litter inputs.",2003-05-01,yes,research (document genres); streams; fertilizer; statistics;,"Chambers, C.S..2003.

Beetle infestations occurred most often in mature stands comprised primarily of  trees  23 cm in diameter at breast height ( 1.4 m), in habitat types likely to contain Douglas-Þr.  Douglas-Þr stands growing on Prichard and lower Wallace formation metasedimentary rocks and  intrusive dikes and sills were signiÞcantly more likely than Douglas-Þr stands growing on other rock  types to harbor beetle populations during nonoutbreak years early in the study period. By 1999 (when  outbreak populations ofDouglas-Þr beetle were present), beetle infestations occurred across all rock  types at rates proportional to the amount ofstand area on those rocks, indicating a decrease in  infestation rates for stands on particular rock types when beetle populations were large. Although the  biological mechanisms inßuencing beetle preferences were not examined, information derived in this  study could be useful in developing quantitative hazard-rating models for Douglas-Þr beetle,  and, subsequently, in designing silvicultural practices to reduce the amount ofbeetle-susceptible  Douglas-Þr stands on particular rock types.  KEY WORDS Douglas-Þr beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae, geology, geographic information sys-tem,  landscape analysis  DOUGLAS-FIR (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is widely distrib-uted  across a variety ofsite conditions throughout the  inland northwest ofthe United States, where it is one  ofthe most important tree species. A diverse variety  of insects and diseases affect Douglas-Þr stands in the  inland northwest, and many are capable ofcausing  economic damage. Most ofthese insect and disease  organisms are native to the area and experience nat-ural  cycles ofbuildup and decline. One ofthe major  insect pests ofDouglas-Þr throughout the region is the  Douglas-Þr beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hop-kins  (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Douglas-Þr beetle typ-ically  has one generation per year, and beetles nor-mally  attack dead or dying trees (McMullen and  Atkins 1962, Furniss et al. 1981, Negron et al. 1999).  Dense stands ofDouglas-Þr are more susceptible to  attack by Douglas-Þr beetles (Furniss 1979, Furniss et  al. 1981, Negron et al. 1999), which typically attack  large diameter ( 30 cm in diameter at breast height  [dbh],  1.4 m) trees (Furniss et al. 1979, Hagle et al.  1987). Furthermore, outbreaks ofDouglas-Þr beetle  are often associated with forest disturbances such as  wildÞre or windstorms (McGregor et al. 1974, Furniss  1975, Furniss et al. 1981).  After a major ice storm in November 1997, an out-break  ofDouglas-Þr beetle occurred throughoutmuch  ofnorthern Idaho and northeastern Washington. On  the Panhandle National Forests, an average of51 ha/yr  was affected by new Douglas-Þr beetle attacks in 1996  and 1997. In 1998,  479 ha were affected by Douglas-Þr  beetle, and in 1999, aerial surveys indicated that  31,093 ha were impacted (USDA 2001). Therefore,  Panhandle National Forests initiated emergency sal-vage  logging operations, both to reduce Þre risk and  the risk ofbeetles spreading to adjacent private lands.  As a prelude to our current study, Panhandle Na-tional  Forests personnel noted that Douglas-Þr beetle  infestations seemed to occur more frequently on cer-tain  rock types than others, even though adjacent  stands on various rock types were otherwise very  similar. Although not implicated in previous studies of  Douglas-Þr beetle susceptibility (Furniss 1979, Furniss  et al. 1979, Shore et al. 1999, Negron et al. 1999),  research suggests that bedrock geology underlying  forest stands affects forest nutrition (Moore et al.  1998), which in turn could impact tree susceptibility  to insects and disease (Mandzak and Moore 1994).  Rock type has been demonstrated to affect tree  1 Idaho Panhandle National Forests, 3815 Schreiber Way, Coeur  dÕAlene, ID 83815.  0046-225X/03/1354Ð1363$04.00/0   2003 Entomological Society ofAmerica  growth and growth response to nitrogen fertilization  (Shen et al. 2000). Rock type also signiÞcantly affects  tree mortality rates on both control and nitrogen-fertilized  plots (Shen et al. 2001). Rock type may thus  result in broad differences in site nutrient conditions.  Potassium nutrition can signiÞcantly affect Douglas-Þr  root biochemistry, including the concentration of  phenolic compounds (Shaw et al. 1998), and there are  signiÞcant differences in Douglas-Þr foliar potassium  (K) concentration by rock type (Shen et al. 2001). For  example, trees growing on metasedimentary rocks had  the lowest foliar K concentrations of all rock types  sampled (Shen et al. 2001). Nutrient-stressed trees  may be unable to successfully defend themselves  against bark beetle attacks due to an insufÞcient re-sponse  ofeither the constitutive or induced resistance  mechanisms (Cook and Hain 1988).  Geology ofthe area is dominated by a group of  Precambrian metasedimentary rocks known as the  Belt Supergroup. The Belt Supergroup is comprised of  a series off ormations, including the Wallace, Prichard,  Burke, Revett, St. Regis, Striped Peak, and Libby (Har-rison  and Campbell 1963, Lewis and Burmester 1999).  The Wallace formation is further subdivided into up-per  and lower members, whereas the Burke, Revett,  and St. Regis formations are often grouped together  and called the Ravalli group. The formal nomenclature  ofBelt rocks is based on their stratigraphy, or the order  in which they were laid down during the original  process ofsedimentation. Almost all ofthe Belt rocks  underwent low-level metamorphism after sedimenta-tion,  such that their original protolith (parent rock) is  still identiÞable. The lithology ofBelt rocks reßects  this metamorphism, such that all formations contain  argillite, siltite, and/or quartzite, which are metamor-phosed  claystone, siltstone, and sandstone, respec-tively.  The dominant lithologies ofthe Belt formations  include quartzite for the Revett and portions of the  Striped Peak, layered gray siltite and argillite for the  Prichard and portions ofthe upper Wallace and  Striped Peak, layered green or red siltite and argillite  for the Burke, St. Regis, and Libby formations, and  carbonate-bearing siltite and quartzite for the lower  Wallace and portions ofthe upper Wallace and Striped  Peak (Munts and Idaho Geological Survey [IGS]  2000). Other lithologies common to the area include  glacial deposits and intrusive (granitic) rocks. Some of  the intrusive rocks occur as plutons, which are deep-seated  granitic intrusions characterized by very large  grain sizes.  Our analysis used Forest Service data on forest veg-etative  cover and Douglas-Þr beetle attack distribu-tions  combined with published geological data to as-sess  whether infestations of Douglas-Þr beetles were  signiÞcantly associated with Douglas-Þr stands on cer-tain  rock types. Rock type differences may be associ-ated  with other environmental or spatial factors that  could themselves account for perceived relationships  between rock type and beetle infestations. Therefore,  additional analyses were conducted to examine these  potential alternative explanations for the rock type/  Douglas-Þr beetle association.  Materials and Methods  Geographic information system (GIS) data layers  were obtained for the BonnerÕs Ferry, Priest Lake, St.  Joe, St. Maries, and Sandpoint ranger districts ofthe  Idaho Panhandle National Forests. The total analysis  area consisted of  445,000 ha, and the insect survey  data spanned a 4-yr period (1996Ð1999). The Forest  Service provided two data sets (USDA 2001). The Þrst  was a vegetative cover layer mapping stands com-prised  primarily oftrees  12.9 cm in dbh, which oc-curred  on various habitat types (Daubenmire and  Daubenmire 1968) likely to contain Douglas-Þr (Zack,  personal communication). The second data set delin-eated  infestations of Douglas-Þr beetle from 1996 to  1999 and was digitized from aerial surveys conducted  by the Forest ServiceÕs Forest Health Protection  group. Infested areas ranged from a few square meters  to several hundred hectares, and although the digi-tized  areas probably included some live trees, the  majority of trees within the affected areas were dead  or dying. These surveys primarily detect trees that  were attacked the previous year because most trees do  not fade and become visible until at least 1 yr after  beetle attack/infestation. For example, trees detected  in 1996 were actually attacked and killed by beetles in  1995. Throughout this article, the years referred to will  be the years in which infestations were detected by  aerial survey.  Digital geology maps for the region were obtained  from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and  the IGS. The Sandpoint 1:250,000 quadrangle was  merged with the Coeur dÕAlene,ThompsonFalls, Wal-lace,  St. Maries, and Headquarters 1:100,000 scale dig-ital  geology maps (IGS 1996, Miller et al. 1999, Lewis  and Derkey 1999, Lewis et al. 1999, Munts and IGS  2000, Burmester et al. 2001). The geology maps were  edge-matched at the quadrangle boundaries. Some  relabeling ofmap units was necessary to maintain a  consistent naming convention across the different  maps; however, rock class aggregation was the same  across all geology maps. The relabeling ofmaps was  necessary because different authors used different  names for the same rock units, a problem commonly  encountered in Belt rocks.  Personnel ofthe Idaho Panhandle National Forests  had observed that the Douglas-Þr beetle infestations  seemed to be more prevalent on stands occurring on  Prichard formation rocks. Therefore, Belt Supergroup  rocks were categorized using their formal names,  whereas other rock types in the analysis area were  categorized by lithology. The resulting eight catego-ries  used in statistical analyses were the Prichard,  Wallace, Libby, and Striped Peak formations, the  Ravalli group (undivided), glacial deposits, intrusive  rocks, and other rocks.  Geographic analyses were conducted using Arc-  View (Environmental Systems Research Institute  1992Ð1999). The Þrst step ofthe geographical analysis  was to intersect the vegetative cover layer with the  geological information layer.Byintersecting these lay-ers,  new polygons were created that preserved indi-  December 2003 GARRISON-JOHNSTON ET AL.: BEETLE INFESTATIONS AND ROCK TYPE 1355  vidual stand size class and geological information. The  areas infested by Douglas-Þr beetle from 1996 through  1999 were then clipped to the intersected Douglas-Þr/  geology layer. Using this clipping technique, the  subsequent analyses were only conducted on beetle  infestations that occurred in stands for which both  stand attribute and geological data were available. The  area infested by Douglas-Þr beetle in 1996 and 1997  were combined because infestations were small dur-ing  those 2 yr compared with 1998 and 1999. A series  of frequency tables tabulating the total affected area  by timber stand type, rock type, and vegetation cat-egory  for each year were then created for use in  statistical analysis. All frequency tables were created  in ArcView (ESRI 1992Ð1999) and exported to Excel  (Microsoft Corporation 1985Ð1999) worksheets.  Only stands that provided suitable habitat for Dou-glas-  Þr beetle were included in analysis, and attack  frequency was analyzed by stand size class. The Pan-handle  National Forests deÞne the various timber size  classes as follows: 1) Sawtimber stands have a mini-mum  of10% ofthe growing stock trees with a dbh   12.5 cm and the stocking oftrees  23 cm dbh and  larger is at least equal to the stocking oftrees 12.5Ð  22.9 cm dbh; 2) Poletimber stands have a minimum of  10% ofthe growing stock trees with a dbh  12.5 cm  and the stocking oftrees from 12.5 to 22.9 cm dbh  exceeds the stocking oftrees 23cmdbh and larger; and  3) multisized stands contain trees in two or more size  classes. To remain consistent with Forest Service mea-surement  protocols and deÞned terminologies, we  used these size classes for analysis, and abbreviated  them as sawtimber, poletimber, and multisized stands  for use throughout this article.  Stand maturity classiÞcation was also based on Pan-handle  National Forests stand inventory deÞnitions  and refers to stage of development for a given stand.  Mature stands are those in which the growth stage has  nearly reached full site potential, whereas immature  stands are still actively growing. To include all habitats  suitable for Douglas-Þr beetle, the initial vegetative  cover data set consisted ofall stands that were pole-size  and larger (including multisized stands), in both  immature and mature growth stages, in all habitat  types likely to contain Douglas-Þr. The resulting data  set included Þve categories, which were immature  poletimber, immature sawtimber, multisized, mature  poletimber, and mature sawtimber.  For analysis, the total stand area in each ofthe Þve  size and maturity class categories was calculated to  determine the baseline distribution ofthese stand  types in the analysis area. This baseline distribution  was considered to be the expected distribution of  Douglas-Þr beetle in the absence ofa size and maturity  class preference. The total beetle-infested area in each  size and maturity class category was then calculated  for each year during the analysis period of 1996  through 1999. These yearly distributions were consid-ered  to be the observed distributions ofDouglas-Þr  beetle for each year studied. Chi-square analysis (Ott  1988) was used to detect signiÞcant differences be-tween  the expected and observed distributions. Based  on this analysis, only those size and maturity classes  that showed expected or greater than expected oc-currences  of beetle infestation were selected for ad-ditional  testing.  Geological differences in beetle infestation prefer-ences  were examined using the selected size and ma-turity  class categories. Total stand area on each rock  type was calculated for this subset of Douglas-Þr  stands. This served as the baseline distribution ofsus-ceptible  Douglas-Þr stands by rock type, and was the  expected distribution ofDouglas-Þr beetle in the ab-sence  of a rock type effect. The total beetle-infested  area on each rock type was then calculated for each  year during the analysis period of1996 through 1999.  These yearly distributions ofbeetle-inf ested area by  rock type were considered to be the observed distri-butions  ofDouglas-Þr beetle for each year studied.  Chi-square analysis (Ott 1988) was used to detect  signiÞcant differences between the expected and ob-served  distributions.  Because differences in beetle infestations occurring  in stands on different rock types could potentially be  explained by other spatial or biophysical effects, two  additional analyses were conducted. First, to deter-mine  whether stand fragmentation was contributing  to the distribution ofbeetle infestations, various patch,  edge, shape, and interspersion metrics were consid-ered  for characterizing and quantifying Douglas-Þr  stand spatial distribution among rock types. The In-terspersion  and Juxtaposition Index (IJI) was selected  because this index measures the extent to which patch  types are interspersed (McGarigal and Marks 1995)  and is applicable for assessment of patch-type spatial  distribution (Haines-Young and Chopping 1996). The  IJI was computed using the formula provided by  McGarigal and Marks (1995):  IJI     i 1  m!    k i 1  m!  {[(eik/E)   ln (eik/E)]/ln  (1/2[m! (m! 1)])}   (100)  where m! is the number ofpatches (Douglas-Þr  stands) by rock type, e is length ofeach unique patch  edge, E is total edge ofpatches within a rock type, and  ln is natural logarithm ArcViewÕs Patch Analyst soft-ware  (Elkie et al. 1999) was used to compute the IJI  for each rock type. Second, we used a biophysical  classiÞcation scheme developed by the USDA Forest  Service (USDA 1997) to examine whether other bio-logical  or physical landscape characteristics might ex-plain  the perceived rock type effect. The Forest Ser-vice  biophysical classiÞcation divides a forested  landscape into 11 possible discrete groups based on  factors such as elevation, slope, aspect, temperature,  wildÞre history, potential tree species diversity, and  soil moisture regime. This classiÞcation scheme inte-grates  many site biophysical factors into a single vari-able.  Six ofthe 11 possible biophysical classes occurred  in the study area. Chi-square analysis (Ott 1988) was  used to examine relationships between rock type and  the biophysical classes such that the expected value  1356 ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY Vol. 32, no. 6  was the distribution ofstand area by rock type, and the  observed value was the distribution ofstand area in  each biophysical class by rock type. Ifrock type did  not affect the occurrence or distribution of biophys-ical  classes, then the distribution ofeach biophysical  class by rock type should occur in the same proportion  as the distribution ofDouglas-Þr stands by rock type.  Results  Size and Maturity Class Analysis. The majority of  the analysis area contained mature (38%) and imma-ture  (49%) sawtimber (Fig. 1). In mature sawtimber,  the 1998 Douglas-Þr beetle infestation rate was sig-niÞcantly  higher (P   0.05,  2   10.34) than the  amount ofstand area in that size class, indicating that  beetles were attacking large-diameter, mature trees  before the high 1999 infestation period. Within the  immature sawtimber class, infestation rates by the  beetle were about the same as the amount ofland area  in immature sawtimber. A small percentage ofthe  analysis area (13%) was in multisized and mature and  immature poletimber stands, therefore these three  categories were combined for chi-square analysis. In-festation  rates by Douglas-Þr beetle were signiÞcantly  lower in these stands compared with than the amount  ofarea within these host types during 1998 (P   0.05,   2   7.56) and 1999 (P   0.05,  2   7.00). Due to the  low rates ofinf estation in poletimber and multisized  stands, the remaining analyses were performed only  on mature and immature sawtimber stands.  Douglas-Fir Beetle Infestations by Rock Type. Sta-tistical  analysis ofthe initial eight rock categories  showed that the Prichard formation had signiÞcantly  higher rates ofbeetle infestation than expected in  1996/1997 (P   0.05,  2   14.71) and 1998 (P   0.05,   2 24.61). Other rock categories were not signiÞcant  in this initial analysis and therefore were examined  more closely for potential within-category relation-ships  that might have been obscured by the initial  categorization scheme or for categories that behaved  similarly and could therefore be grouped.  The largest proportion ofmature and immature  sawtimber stands in the analysis area occurred on the  Wallace formation rock type (Table 1, 30%), which  was comprised ofthree members, including the lower,  upper, and undivided (these rocks were not distin-guishable  as lower or upper). Chi-square analysis was  performed on stands on the Wallace formation rocks  to determine whether Douglas-Þr beetle infestation  rates varied between members. No single formation  hosted infestation rates greater than expected in 1996/  1997; however, both the lower and upper members  showed rates ofbeetle infestation that were signiÞ-cantly  different from stand distribution on thosemem-bers  in 1998 (Table 2). Proportionately more beetle  infestation (P 0.05, 2 7.54) occurred on the lower  Wallace (81%) compared with stand area on lower  Wallace (60%), whereas proportionately less infesta-  Fig. 1.

In 1999, Douglas-Þr beetle infestation areas  were distributed in the same proportion as Douglas-Þr  stand area on all members ofthe Wallace formation.  The lower member ofthe Wallace formation was re-tained  as a separate category for subsequent areawide  analysis. Because the upper and undivided members  ofthe Wallace formation comprised relatively less  stand area and were therefore of less signiÞcance in  the areawide analysis, they were subsequently  grouped with other Belt rocks.  Douglas-Þr stands occurring on Libby and Striped  Peak rock formations comprised 2 and 9%, respec-tively,  ofthe stands examined (Table 1). Ravalli group  rocks occurred beneath13%ofthe entire analysis area,  and were composed off our units (Burke, St. Regis, and  Revett formations, and undivided Ravalli group). The  Libby, Striped Peak, and Ravalli group rocks were  individually examined by chi-square analysis. No pat-terns  or signiÞcant differences in beetle infestation  rates among these formations were evident. There-fore,  the Libby, Striped Peak, and Ravalli group rocks  were combined with the lower and undivided mem-bers  ofthe Wallace formation as “other Belt rocks” for  the Þnal areawide analysis.  Thirteen percent ofDouglas-Þr sawtimber stands  in the analysis area occurred on intrusive rocks  (Table 1). The intrusive rocks category encompassed  55 individual rock units, most ofwhich represented  local intrusive structures (plutons, dikes, and sills). A  chi-square analysis ofDouglas-Þr beetle infestation  rates on intrusive rocks was performed to determine  whether infestation rates varied by intrusive rock unit.  Two intrusive rock units showed signiÞcantly higher  infestation rates than expected based on the amount  ofstand area on those rock types (Table 3).

The remaining  75% ofDouglas-Þr sawtimber stands on other intrusive  rocks had signiÞcantly lower infestations of Douglas-Þr  beetles during all years ofthe study (P   0.05;  1996/1997,  2   15.93; 1998,  2   22.87; 1999,  2    20.52). Even during the peak year ofthe outbreak  (1999), stands growing on these other intrusive rocks  had signiÞcantly lower rates ofbeetle infestations than  expected compared with the amount ofDouglas-Þr  stand area they contained. Approximately 11% ofthe  Douglas-Þr stands in the entire study area occurred on  glacial deposits, whereas other rock types (carbonate  rocks, metamorphic rocks, other [nonglacial] depos-its,  extrusive rocks, and sedimentary rocks) occurred  under 3% ofthe analysis area. These rock types were  uncommon in the study area and a more detailed  analysis was not possible. Among the intrusive rocks,  diabase sills and dikes were retained as a separate  category for subsequent analysis. All other intrusive  rocks, including Galena Point granodiorite, which oc-cupied  too small ofa land area to be ofsigniÞcance in  the areawide analysis, were grouped with glacial de-posits  and other rocks for subsequent analysis.  The Þnal, areawide chi-square analysis was per-formed  for all mature and immature sawtimber-sized  Douglas-Þr stands in the analysis area, for Þve rock  categories, including the Prichard formation, the  lower member ofthe Wallace formation, other Belt  rocks, diabase sills and dikes, and glacial deposits and  other rocks (Table 4). In the nonoutbreak years of  1996/1997, signiÞcantly greater areas ofDouglas-Þr  beetle infestations occurred on the Prichard forma-tion  (35%; P 0.05, 2 14.71) and on diabase sills and  dikes (11%; P   0.05,  2   43.64) than the amount of  Douglas-Þr stands on those rock types (19 and 2%,  respectively; Fig. 4). In contrast, signiÞcantly less in-festation  area occurred on other Belt rocks (10%; P    0.05, 2 17.86) compared with Douglas-Þr stand area  on other Belt rocks (36%) during those years. During  the Þrst year in which beetle populations began in-creasing  (1998), signiÞcantly higher areas ofbeetle  infestation again occurred on Prichard formation  (40%; P   0.05,  2   24.61), and also occurred on the  Fig. 3.

As in 1996/1997, other  Belt rocks were again affected at a rate signiÞcantly  lower than expected in 1998 (10%; P   0.05,  2    17.70), and glacial deposits and other rocks were also  affected at rates signiÞcantly lower than expected in  1998 (8%; P   0.05,  2   12.06) based on the amount  ofstand area (26%) on other rocks. By 1999, the  proportion ofinf estation areas by rock type did not  differ from the proportion of stand area by rock type  for most of the analysis area. The exception was the  beetle infestation rate on glacial deposits and other  rocks, which at 10% was signiÞcantly lower (P   0.05,   2 9.70) than the amount ofstand area (26%) on that  rock type.

Interspersion and Juxtaposition Index and Biophys-ical  Class Analyses. IJI values measured the extent  that Douglas-Þr stands on the various rocks were in-terspersed.  Values ranged from 53 for diabase sills and  dikes to 72 for glacial deposits and other rocks  (Table 4). All other rock types showed similar IJI  values, ranging from 58 to 61. The IJI approaches zero  when the distribution ofstands is uneven and ap-proaches  100 when stands are equally adjacent. Thus,  Douglas-Þr stands growing on diabase sills and dikes  were somewhat clumped in their distribution relative  to stands on glacial deposits and other rocks, with  stands on all other rock types falling somewhere in  between.  Biophysical class (USDA 1997) distributions by  rock type showed signiÞcant differences from the ex-pected  distributions (Table 5). The lower Wallace  rock type was less likely to contain warm and dry  habitat than expected (P   0.05,  2   25.62), whereas  diabase sills and dikes were more likely to contain cool  and moist habitat (P   0.05,  2   10.34). Other Belt  rocks (besides Prichard and lower Wallace) were  more likely to contain warm and dry habitat (P 0.05,   2  15.07), and glacial deposits and other rocks were  less likely to occur on warm and dry (P   0.05,  2    43.22), moderately warm and moderately dry (P    0.05, 2 11.92), and moderatelywarmand moist (P   0.05,  2  15.05) conditions.

Discussion  SigniÞcant effects of rock type on the infestation  pattern ofDouglas-Þr beetle were found in spite ofthe  need for broad classiÞcations of tree size and maturity  attributes (i.e., mature sawtimber and immature saw-timber).  The early years (1996/1997) ofthe analysis  period were considered nonoutbreak years, whereas  in 1998 the Þrst signs ofincreased beetle activity be-came  apparent, signiÞcantly so in mature sawtimber  stands. By 1999, beetle populations had increased to  such high levels in mature sawtimber stands that pre-viously  less susceptible immature sawtimber stands  were also attacked. Douglas-Þr beetles preferentially  attack mature and overmature Douglas-Þr trees that  are stressed before attack (Furniss et al. 1979, 1981;  Negron 1998, Negron et al. 1999). The increased pop-ulation  ofDouglas-Þr beetles during the analysis pe-riod  may have resulted from the severe tree damage  caused by a November 1997 ice and snow storm  throughout the analysis area. The broken and dam-aged  trees would provide excellent habitat for the 1998  population ofDouglas-Þr beetles (Furniss et al. 1981).  The increased beetle population, subsequent attacks  and tree mortality would have then been evident on  the 1999 aerial surveys.  Douglas-Þr beetle infestations in mature and imma-ture  sawtimber stands during early years ofthe anal-ysis  period (1996Ð1998) occurred more frequently on  the Prichard and lower Wallace rock formations and  on diabase sills and dikes. By 1999, stands on all rock  types were affected at about the same proportion as  expected based on their occurrence, except for those  on glacial deposits and other rocks, which were af-fected  less frequently than expected. Among the in-trusive  rocks, infestations occurred at a high rate on  the Galena Point granodiorite in 1999, though this rock  type occupied too small ofan area to be ofsigniÞcance  in the areawide analysis. Diabase sills and dikes and  the Galena Point granodiorite were both associated  with and surrounded by Prichard and lower Wallace  formation rocks. Stands on these relatively small sills,  dikes, and plutons were likely infested with Douglas-Þr  beetles because oftheir proximity to stands on  Prichard and lower Wallace rocks, which were har-boring  Douglas-Þr beetle populations.  Douglas-Þr stands growing on the Prichard and  lower Wallace formations and on diabase sills and  dikes had similar spatial distribution patterns as stands  growing on the other rock types occupying substantial  portions of the study area. Although some differences  in expected distribution ofrock types across biophys-ical  classes did occur, these differences did not seem  to be related to beetle infestation patterns. For exam-ple,  although stands on both lower Wallace and glacial  deposits and other rocks had lower than expected  distributions ofwarm and dry habitat, the lower Wal-lace  showed a high 1998 infestation area, whereas  glacial deposits and other rocks showed a low 1998  infestation area. The similarities in spatial distributions  and lack of biophysical land class effect suggest that  rock types directly inßuence trees growing upon  them, possibly through nutritional differences. Fur-thermore,  nonoutbreak and early outbreak popula-tions  ofDouglas-Þr beetles such as those occurring in  1996Ð1998 may persist in trees growing on Prichard  and lower Wallace formation rock types, and perhaps  diabase sills and dikes. However, by the 1999 outbreak  period, areas infested by Douglas-Þr beetles were not  signiÞcantly different from the distribution of stand  area for any of the rock types except glacial deposits  and other rocks, which were affected at rates lower  than expected. It seems that by 1999, the beetle pop-ulations  were so large that they were capable ofsuc-cessfully  attacking trees growing on almost all of the  rock types in the study area.  Douglas-Þr stands on Prichard and lower Wallace  rock formations, and perhaps diabase sills and dikes,  may act as refugia for nonoutbreak populations of  Douglas-Þr beetle. Armillaria ostoyae root rot is prev-alent  throughout the study area and may leave the  trees more susceptible to successful attack by bark  beetles. Douglas-Þr root biochemistry, including phe-nolic  and sugar concentration ratio, signiÞcantly af-fects  the incidence of Armillaria infection (Entry et al.  1991). Potassium nutrition affects Douglas-Þr root  phenolic and sugar concentration ratios (Shaw et al.  1998). Therefore, it may be that Douglas-Þr trees un-able  to produce sufÞcient resins to resist root rot  infection are also more susceptible to attack by Dou-glas-  Þr beetles. Additionally, root rot-infected trees  are more prone to windthrow, and such downed trees  provide additional suitable Douglas-Þr beetle habitat  (Furniss 1962). Mature, sawtimber-sized Douglas-Þr  trees growing on soils developed from Prichard and  lower Wallace formation rocks and perhaps intrusive  dikes and sillsmaybe nutrient-stressed, thus providing  susceptible trees as Douglas-Þr beetle habitat. Severe  nutrient stress has been suggested to limit or decrease  a treeÕs ability to resist attack by herbivorous insects  by limiting the treeÕs ability to produce and/or accu-mulate  defensive compounds (Tuomi et al. 1988). Nu-trient  limitations for stands growing on Prichard and  lower Wallace rock formations (and perhaps on dia-base  sills and dikes) may contribute to physiological  stresses experienced by Douglas-Þr growing on these  sites (Mandzak and Moore 1994; Moore et al. 1998;  Shen et al. 2000, 2001). Populations ofDouglas-Þr  beetles may persist at relatively low levels in stands on  these sites. After a large disturbance, such as the 1997  ice storm, these beetle populations may experience  signiÞcant increases allowing subsequent infestations  to expand into stands growing on a variety ofrock  types.  In stands ofsawtimber-sized Douglas-Þr, infesta-tions  ofDouglas-Þr beetles were larger in 1998 than in  preceding years, and these infestations were more  prevalent in stands growing on Wallace and Prichard  rock formations than other rock types. The condi-tional  probability ofencountering Douglas-Þr beetle  infestations in stands growing on Prichard formation  December 2003 GARRISON-JOHNSTON ET AL.: BEETLE INFESTATIONS AND ROCK TYPE 1361  rocks was several times greater than for other rock  types during the nonoutbreak years, 1996 and 1997. If  rock type, and, presumably, nutrient stress are asso-ciated  with subsequent Douglas-Þr beetle infestation  levels, then rock type could be used in quantitative  hazard rating models similar to those proposed by  Furniss et al. (1981), Negron (1998), and Negron et al.  (1999). Furthermore, early warning systems for pre-dicting  Douglas-Þr beetle outbreaks could be estab-lished  in Douglas-Þr stands growing on Prichard and  lower Wallace rock formations and perhaps diabase  sills and dikes, because beetle populations seem to Þrst  reach outbreak levels in stands growing on these rock  types. Silvicultural practices aimed at reducing the  amount ofovermature, sawtimber-sized Douglas-Þr  stands growing on these susceptible rock types may  also reduce the tree mortality and consequent in-creased  wildÞre danger encountered in the most re-cent  Douglas-Þr beetle epidemic.

Most of the metasedimentary rocks underlying Inland Northwest forests belong to the Belt  Supergroup, which encompasses several formations and a wide variety of lithologies. In order to  better categorize the geochemical variation of metasedimentary and other rocks, WPI values  were calculated for a wide variety of samples collected by Idaho Geological Survey and U.S.  Geological Survey personnel throughout northern Idaho. The WPI values were tabulated by  lithology and formation and analyzed for differences that might help explain variation in forest  nutritional status.  Introduction  The Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) was established in the late  1970’s to test the effects of fertilization on forest growth. Early work with nitrogen (N) fertilizer  indicated that high rates of N could increase forest growth and yield, but in some cases could  also increase tree mortality (Mika et al., 1993; Moore et al., 1994; Mandzak and Moore, 1994).  Where tree mortality occurred, it often coincided precisely with square plot treatment areas, in a  phenomenon which came to be known as “square death.” Causes of mortality included root  disease and insect attack. In some cases no obvious mortality agent was detected, but less  obvious changes in physiological processes were suspected. Subsequent research indicated that  forest potassium (K) status, as measured by foliar K concentration, was an important predictor of  2  forest health status. Where high rates of N-fertilizer were applied to high-K trees, high growth  rates resulted. Where high rates of N-fertilizer were applied to low-K trees, mortality resulted.  These early findings of the IFTNC led to the development of a Forest Health Study,  initiated in 1994. Because parent rock is such an important source of ecosystem K, rock type  was included as a stratification variable in this study, along with potential vegetation series,  which is also known to affect site productivity (Moore et al., 1991). The resulting experimental  design called for three study sites to be established in each of four rock type and three vegetation  series categories (Table 1). In order to be selected for study, sites supporting live, healthy,  second-rotation crops of forest trees were required. After three years of site visits to over 100  candidate stands, only one suitable study stand was found to represent the metasedimentary rock  type category on drier (Douglas-fir and grand fir) vegetation series. Such sites did not host the  live, healthy forest stands required for the study. Because of this apparent inability to support  healthy forest stands, metasedimentary rocks were perceived to be ‘bad rocks’ from a forest  nutrition point of view. Even more significantly, this finding called attention to the importance  of rock as a factor affecting forest health conditions and nutrient status in the inland northwestern  United States. Several subsequent studies and reviews have further emphasized the important  effect of parent rock, and the negative effect of metasedimentary rock, on forest health  conditions (Moore and Mika, 1997; Moore et al., 2000; Shen et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2003;  Garrison-Johnston et al., 2003).  Table 1. Experimental design for IFTNC Forest Health study. Design called for three  sites in each category. The number in parenthesis indicates the actual number of sites  found in each category. Dry site types on metamorphic rock types were not found to  support successful stands for inclusion in the study.  Rock Type/Veg.

The Belt  Supergroup is comprised of a series of formations, including the Wallace, Prichard, Burke,  Revett, St. Regis, Striped Peak, and Libby (Harrison and Campbell, 1963). The Wallace  formation is further subdivided into upper and lower members while the Burke, Revett and St.  Regis formations are often grouped together and called the Ravalli group. The formal  nomenclature of Belt rocks is based on their stratigraphy, or the order in which they were laid  down during the original process of sedimentation. Almost all of the Belt rocks underwent low-level  metamorphism following sedimentation, such that their original protolith (parent rock) is  still identifiable. The lithology of Belt rocks reflects this metamorphism, such that all formations  contain argillite, siltite and/or quartzite, which are metamorphosed claystone, siltstone and  sandstone, respectively. The dominant lithologies of the Belt formations include quartzite for the  Revett and portions of the Striped Peak, layered gray siltite and argillite for the Prichard and  portions of the upper Wallace and Striped Peak, layered green or red siltite and argillite for the  Burke, St. Regis and Libby formations, carbonate-bearing siltite and quartzite for the lower  3  Wallace and portions of the upper Wallace and Striped Peak, and dolomite for portions of the  Striped Peak (Munts and Idaho Geological Survey, 2000). Other lithologies common to the area  include glacial deposits, Columbia River flood basalts, and various intrusive rocks.  Because of the importance of K in forest health assessment, rocks underlying a variety of  forested sites were examined in an effort to correlate rock K status with health and nutrition  trends. However, it soon became evident that other rock characteristics were equally important  in assessing the geologic contribution to forest nutritional conditions. Rock weathering  characteristics appear to be at least as important as rock chemical composition in determining  soil textural and chemical characteristics. Forest nutrition has become an increasingly important  component of the management of public, private and industrial forest lands in north Idaho and  the inland northwest. Third-party certification criteria include examination of forest nutrient  management practices on industrial forest lands, while nutrient management has become the  subject of increased litigation on public forest lands. Because of this increased public focus on  forest nutrition, an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying rock type’s effect on  forest nutrition is becoming increasingly important. As part of ongoing mapping efforts, Idaho  Geological Survey (IGS) and United States Geological Survey (USGS) personnel have been  collecting rock samples throughout north Idaho since 1990. In an effort to help determine  whether geochemistry might help to explain the perceived variation in forest nutrient conditions  by rock type, these data were compiled for analysis of weathering potential.  Methodology  Geochemical data from 446 samples collected by IGS and USGS personnel between  1990 and 2002 were compiled. A modification of Reiche’s (1943) Weathering Potential Index  (WPI) was selected for analysis.  WPI = 100*moles(Na2O+K2O+MgO+CaO)  moles(Na2O+K2O+MgO+CaO+SiO2+Al2O3+Fe2O3)  In order to make the molar conversion, each whole-rock geochemical value was divided by the  sum of its component atomic weights. In the original index, H2O was subtracted from the  cations on top of the equation (Reiche, 1943). Because the 446 samples included in this analysis  were not routinely examined for water, this information was not available, and therefore was not  included in the current analysis. For analysis, the 446 samples were categorized in several ways.  The first was using the basic IFTNC classification of basalt, granite, and  metamorphic/metasedimentary. Then, the samples were assigned to one of 32 lithology  categories. Finally, the 446 samples were categorized by formation, or as ‘other’ if no formation  was noted. Statistical analysis was then performed using a general linear models procedure  (SAS Institute Inc., 1990), to determine whether variation in WPI or SiO2 was explained by any  of the three categorization schemes.  Results and Discussion  The first step of analysis was to examine WPI by a broad classification scheme  commonly used by foresters and resource managers in the inland northwest, including basalt,  granite, metasedimentary and other. The ‘basalt’ category, including basalts and andesites, had  the highest average WPI of 22.8, and showed the narrowest range of variation (Figure 3). The  ‘granite’ category, including granites, granodiorites, diorites, quartz diorites, and tonalities, had  4  Basalt  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31  WPI  number of samples  Mean = 22.8  Median=22.9  Std.Dev.=1.9  Range=13.3  Min=15.9  Max=29.2  n=110  Granite  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31  WPI  number of samples  Mean = 13.7  Median=11.5  Std.Dev.=5.4  Range=27.7  Min=7.3  Max=35.0  n=124  the next highest average WPI of 13.7, with a range approximately twice that of the basalt  category (Figure 4). The ‘metasedimentary’ category included several lithologies, and showed  the lowest average WPI of 10.7, and the highest range of variation, from 1.0 to 75.2 (Figure 5).  Statistically, this broad classification scheme did not perform well, explaining only about 30% of  the variation in WPI across the 446 samples examined. However, this type of broad  classification is commonly used by non-geologists to categorize and understand rocks. The  IFTNC used this classification to assess tree growth and forest health in a region-wide  fertilization trial, and found that basalts generally showed good tree growth, while granites and  metasedimentary rocks showed variable tree growth . Variation in rock weathering  characteristics is a likely reason for the observed variation in tree growth. This application of  Reiche’s (1943) WPI demonstrates the variability inherent in such a broad classification scheme,  and suggests that some other classification might be more useful for analyzing forest growth and  health data.

Histogram of distribution of WPI values on metasedimentary rocks  The second phase of analysis was to examine WPI using a more detailed lithology  classification containing 32 categories. Silicon dioxide was also analyzed using this  classification scheme, as a possible surrogate for the WPI calculation. Statistically, this  classification performed much better than the broad classification used in the first phase of  analysis, explaining about 85% of the variation in WPI values and about 80% of the variation in  SiO2 values (Figure 6). Dolomite showed a significantly higher WPI and lower SiO2 than any  other rocks, as expected based on chemical composition. Carbonate and calc-silicate rocks also  tended to rank high in WPI, along with basalt and diorite. Plagioclase-bearing, siliceous igneous  rocks (tonalite, granodiorite, quartz diorite, dacite) fell into the mid-range of WPI values, while  the more alkaline igneous (granite, rhyolite) and metasedimentary rocks fell into the lower end of  the range. As compared to the broad categorization scheme first analyzed, the lithology  categorization provided a much-improved means of explaining the observed variability in WPI.  Also, WPI seemed to capture expected weathering characteristics, while SiO2 did not. For  example, quartzites ranked low in WPI and high in SiO2 due to their high SiO2 content.  However, rocks in the ‘quartzite-carbonate’ category showed a significantly higher WPI than  non-carbonate quartzites (as expected for carbonate-bearing rocks), while the SiO2 ranking for  the ‘quartzite-carbonate’ category remained very high, and in fact was second only to the non-carbonate  quartzites. Two important points were revealed in this phase of analysis. First,  complete and consistent lithology descriptors can be used to gain some general idea of expected  weathering trends, and second, that WPI was better than SiO2 in describing expected weathering  trends.  Because Precambrian metasedimentary rocks are so common in north Idaho, and are  often mapped and described by stratigraphic formation rather than lithology, a third analysis was  performed using formation names. Formation names were available for all Belt rocks, as well as  the Syringa formation and many of the Columbia River basalt flows. If a ‘carbonate’ or ‘calc-silicate’  modifier was available, that was also included with the formation name. The St. Regis,  Burke and Revett formation rocks were grouped into the Ravalli Group for this analysis. Other  basalts, granites and non-Precambrian rocks were grouped into an ‘Other’ category. Weathering  potential index and SiO2 were analyzed using the resulting 16 categories (Figure 7). Statistically,  6  this classification technique also worked reasonably well, explaining about 60% of the variation  in WPI, and 53% of the variation in SiO2. The carbonate and calc-silicate members of  Precambrian metasedimentary formations (except Prichard), along with the basalts, had  significantly higher WPI rankings than the other Precambrian metasedimentary rocks. Among  the other metasedimentary formations, WPI ranked in the order Libby &gt; Wallace &gt;Prichard &gt;  Syringa &gt; Prichard-carbonate &gt; Striped Peak &gt; Ravalli Group. The concurrent increase in SiO2  showed variability similar to that discussed above for lithology. This phase of analysis re-emphasized  the importance of including information on calc-silicate or carbonate properties as  geologic modifiers, if available. This analysis also showed that calc-silicate or carbonate-bearing  properties were perhaps more important than formation itself in determining rock weathering  trends.  Conclusions  This modification of Reiche’s (1943) WPI provided a useful and logical means of  detecting perceived geologic controls on tree nutrition and forest health in the inland northwest.  By applying WPI to several classification schemes, the value of providing clear lithological  terminology to non-geologist end-users emerged as an important factor. The calculation of the  WPI provided a convenient means of reducing a large amount of geochemical information into a  single value, which could then be analyzed categorically. Weathering potential index provided a  better explanation of expected weathering trends than did SiO2 alone. While further work on the  contribution of rock mineral composition to rock weathering patterns is needed, WPI appeared to  provide a suitable means of describing observed weathering pattern variation using easily-available  geochemical data. Conversely, lithologic descriptors, including calc-silicate or  carbonate modifiers, were very useful in explaining expected weathering characteristics.  Citations  Garrison-Johnston, M. T., J. A.

The study is comprised of eight installations located in four different regions of the  Forest. Two fertilization treatments were applied, one using nitrogen alone and the other using a  combination of nitrogen and sulfur. Study plots were established and fertilized in the fall of  1991, and subsequent biannual measurements have been taken to detect treatment response. This  report describes the methodology and the eight-year results of this study.  Figure 1. Locations of Umatilla Mixed Conifer Study Sites  * The  Dalles  * La  Grande  OREGON IDAHO  MONTANA  WASHINGTON  Heppner  Ukiah  Pendleton  Pomeroy  3  Methods  This study is located in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon and southeastern  Washington. Eight study sites were located on the Pomeroy, Pendleton, Ukiah, and Heppner  ranger districts within the Umatilla National Forest. Two installations were established at each  of the Pomeroy and Pendleton locations, one was established at Ukiah and three at Heppner.  Geographically, these four locations are oriented in a line from northeast (NE) to southwest  (SW), respectively. Figure 1 shows the locations of the study sites.  All eight installations were established in October 1991, in mixed conifer stands. The  Pomeroy, Pendleton and Ukiah stands were regenerated naturally, and had been thinned 6-10  years prior to plot establishment. The three Heppner stands were planted, however the  established spacing in two of these stands has been influenced by natural regeneration.  Elevations range from 4500 to 5500 ft above sea level, and vegetation series are grand fir (Abies  grandis) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Soil parent materials are basalts. Site  characteristics for the eight study sites are given in Table 1.

Within each site, the plots are grouped into two blocks of three according to tree and site  similarities. The three treatments applied in each block included a control (C), 200 lb/ac (225  kg/ha) nitrogen (N), and 200 lbs/ac nitrogen plus 100 lbs/ac (113 kg/ha) sulfur (N+S). Nitrogen  was applied in the form of urea, and sulfur in the form of ammonium sulfate. Treatments were  applied at the time of plot establishment in 1991.  Initial measurements were taken at the time of establishment, and all live trees taller than  4.5 ft (1.35 m) were tagged and measured for height, diameter and defect. Tree diameters were  measured every two years, and any incidence of damage or mortality was noted at each visit.  Diameter measurements occurred during the fall months of 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999. Height  measurements were taken every four years (1995 and 1999). Tree volumes were estimated using  regional species-specific volume equations (Wykoff et al. 1982). Details on stand characteristics  at time of establishment (1991) and at each remeasurement period are given in the appendix.  Analysis  Each of the eight installations consists of two blocks of three plots each, in a split-plot  arrangement. As can be seen in Figure 1, the eight installations occurred in four groups  corresponding geographically to the four ranger districts. During the first growth response  analysis performed in 1994, we found that this location grouping was an important factor  explaining growth response differences. Subsequent analyses have been performed using this  'location effect' as a primary factor. For this arrangement, a split-plot design is still utilized,  however blocks per location replaces blocks per installation as the experimental units. This  works reasonably well for analysis, although the differing number of installations at each  5  location leads to an unbalanced experimental design. The Pomeroy and Pendleton locations each  have four blocks, whereas Ukiah has only two and Heppner has six. However a perhaps more  serious problem is the number of confounding factors across the four locations, making it  difficult to determine if one or a combination of factors, or something else entirely, influenced  fertilization response. Geographic location effects could result from differences in rainfall or  other climatic or environmental factors. In addition to these regional variables, a number of  stand conditions also contribute to the possible confounding factors. Several factors which differ  between the four locations are shown in Table 2.  Table 2.

This situation was particularly  noticeable for the Ukiah and Heppner installations, because the trees were so small initially that  the range of basal areas within a block varied by as much as 85%. The ranges of initial basal  areas, quadratic mean diameters and stand density indices for each block are shown in Table 3.  Table 3.

The first included  the Pomeroy and Pendleton large-tree installations. The second grouping included the three  small-tree Heppner installations. Finally, due to its dissimilarity to any of the other stands,  Ukiah was analyzed separately. This solved several problems for the larger trees. The data were  now balanced with two installations at each of the two locations. Furthermore, the starting  conditions were much more similar and within-block differences smaller than for the other two  locations. However for the smaller trees at Ukiah and Heppner, differences in initial conditions  remained. Several data adjustments and analytical approaches were undertaken. For both sites,  the plot-level values for all independent variables were recalculated using only those trees which  were greater than or equal to 6.5 ft in height at the time of plot establishment (1991). This was  7  done to eliminate the variation caused by ‘ingrowth’ of small trees which were close to the 4.5 ft  height limit for measurement trees. Relative eight-year volume growth, which is eight-year  growth expressed as a percentage of initial volume, was calculated for the Heppner sites. For the  Ukiah, Heppner and the Pomeroy/ Pendleton groups, absolute volume growth, absolute basal  area growth, and absolute height growth were analyzed. Gross and net results were similar, so  only the results for gross response are provided in this report. Dependent variables used for  each of the three sets of analysis are summarized in Table 4.  Table 4.

The Pomeroy and Pendleton analysis used the following model statement:  Yijk = μ + αj + πi(j) + βk + (αβ)jk + (βπ)ki(j) + εijk  Where  Yijk = value in each block for each location and treatment combination  μ = grand mean  αj = location effect (fixed)  πi(j) = block effect for block within location (random)  βk = fertilization treatment effect (fixed)  (αβ)jk = location by treatment interaction  (βπ)ki(j) = treatment by block interaction  εijk = error term  The Heppner analysis was performed using the model statement:  Yijk = μ + αj + πi(j) + βk + (αβ)jk + (βπ)ki(j) + εijk  Where  Yijk = value in each block for each installation and treatment combination  μ = grand mean  αj = installation effect (random)  πi(j) = block effect for block within installation (random)  βk = fertilization treatment effect (fixed)  (αβ)jk = installation by treatment interaction  (βπ)ki(j) = treatment by block interaction  εijk = error term  Since the Ukiah location was represented by only one installation, the data were analyzed as a  simple randomized block design. The model statement for this analysis was:  Yijk = μ + αj + πi + εijk  Where  Yijk = value in each block for each treatment  μ = grand mean  αj = treatment effect (fixed)  πi(j) = block effect (random)  εijk = error term  9  For all basal area and volume analyses, initial basal area (BA0) was included as a covariate.  Height growth analyses used no covariate. All analyses were performed using the analysis of  variance procedures in the general linear models module of SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 1985).  Results and Discussion  Pomeroy and Pendleton  Eight-year volume, basal area and height results for the four installations at Pomeroy and  Pendleton showed that the treatment effects were significant for volume (p=.0080), marginally  significant for basal area (p=.1010), and non-significant for height (p=.2041). Examination of  least squares means for volume showed significantly greater growth on both the N and N+S plots  than on the control plots. Basal area tended towards greater growth for the N treatments and  showed significantly greater growth on the N+S treatments. Height growth was significantly  greater on the N treatments, and tended to be greater on the N+S treatments.  Growth estimates for each location were adjusted to the average initial basal area per  location (53 ft2/ac for Pomeroy and 82 ft2/ac for Pendleton). Average growth estimates over  both locations were adjusted to the overall BA0 of 67 ft2/ac. Using these adjusted estimates,  fertilization response was also calculated, using the following equation:  Response = (Fertilized Growth - Control Growth)/Control Growth * 100  Growth increments and responses for the Pomeroy and Pendleton sites are summarized in Table  5.  10  Table 5: Absolute volume, basal area and height growth by treatment across the Pomeroy and Pendleton  locations for Umatilla mixed conifer study in northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Treatments  include control (C), 200#/ac nitrogen (N), and 200#/ac nitrogen plus 100#/ac sulfur (N+S).

The Pomeroy sites showed the greatest percentage response,  with significant 12.9 and 20.2% increases to N and N+S respectively. The Pendleton response  was lower, with a 6% response to N and a significant 8.7% response to N+S. For both Pendleton  and Pomeroy, response was greater following N+S fertilization than N-only, however the  difference between responses was not significant. Overall, the 13.1% volume response to N+S  was greater than the 8.7% response to N-only, and both responses were significant.  Basal area (BA) response for the northeast group to N+S was also positive and  significant, with an overall 10.7% increase in BA growth during the eight-year measurement  period. The response to N-only, while not significant, did show a positive trend of 7.6% during  the measurement period. The Pomeroy installations showed significant positive responses of  13.7% and 17% to N and N+S fertilization respectively. The Pendleton responses of 3% and 6%  were not significant at p=.10. The Pomeroy sites not only responded better than the Pendleton  sites to fertilization, but they responded so strongly as to drive the overall significance for the  combined sites.  Height growth showed a significant overall increase of 4.2% to N+S fertilization. While  both locations showed greater height growth following N+S than N-only fertilization, these  responses were not significant at p=.10. However it is interesting to note that while BA growth  tended to be greater at Pomeroy than Pendleton, height growth tended to be greater at Pendleton  than at Pomeroy. According to Table 2, basal area conditions and stand density index were  generally greater for Pendleton than for Pomeroy. These higher densities may cause the trees to  respond to fertilization by increasing height growth rather than diameter growth, which may  12  explain the differences in both height and BA growth between the two locations. By implication  this also affects overall volume response, as basal area is more important in volume  determination than is height. These results also offered evidence that lower-density stands  responded better to fertilization, highlighting the importance of density management in addition  to fertilization as an important nutrient management activity.  Heppner  The three installations at Heppner were analyzed for absolute volume, relative volume,  absolute BA and absolute height growth. Results of volume analyses are shown in Table 6a,  while basal area and height results are shown in Table 6b.

In other words, the fertilized plots grew  less than the control plots. However these results are related more to initial tree size and density  conditions than to fertilization itself. A review of Table 3 indicates that at the time of initial plot  establishment and fertilization, the Heppner sites generally displayed very low basal areas and  very low stand density. These were very small trees experiencing open-grown conditions. The  growth rate of trees under these conditions is more dependent on individual tree characteristics  14  such as size and crown than on site resources such as nutrients and water. The following figure  illustrates the relationship between initial tree size and eight-year volume increment for the  eighteen plots at the three Heppner installations:  Figure 2: Eight-Year Volume Increment vs. Initial  Volume  Heppner Installations  150  250  350  450  550  650  750  5 10 15 20 25 30 35  Initial Volume (ft3/ac)  Gross Volume Increment  (ft3/ac)  This figure shows the strong relationship between initial tree size and current volume growth.  Essentially, the bigger the trees were to start with, the greater the volume increment. Had all the  plots started out with the exact same size and density conditions, we may have been able to  detect a fertilizer response. Unfortunately, differences in initial conditions between plots,  combined with the strong relationship between initial tree size and eight-year volume growth,  make it very difficult to detect fertilizer response.  One method of accounting for initial size differences in an analysis is to determine  relative volume growth, which expresses volume growth as a percentage of initial volume.  Relative volume growth is also shown in Table 6a. For the Heppner plots, since the trees were  so small initially, relative growth ranged well over 2000 percent. However, this analysis did  show 17.3% greater growth following N+S fertilization compared to the controls. For each  r2 = .76  15  individual installation, a positive response to N+S fertilization was detected, though none of the  responses were significant at p=.10. Nitrogen-only fertilization responses tended to be negative  to none, both on an individual installation basis and overall.  Absolute basal area and height growth for the Heppner installations were quite similar to  the results for absolute volume (Table 6b). Since these attributes are both reflected in the  previously discussed volume response, basal area and height fertilization responses will not be  further discussed.  Ukiah  The single installation at Ukiah was analyzed for absolute volume, basal area, and height  growth. Results are shown in Table 7:  Table 7: Absolute volume, basal area and height growth by treatment at the Ukiah  installations for Umatilla mixed conifer study in northeast Oregon. Treatments include  control (C), 200#/ac nitrogen (N), and 200#/ac nitrogen plus 100#/ac sulfur (N+S).

In  spite of this basal area adjustment, the results in Table 7 show negative volume, basal area and  height growth responses to fertilization at Ukiah. None of these responses was significant at  p=.10. As with Heppner, the negative responses are likely due to initial conditions rather than  to fertilization. Ukiah results were affected by the same problems as Heppner, in that the stand  was comprised of small trees with low densities at study initiation. However for Ukiah, the  differences in initial conditions between treatments was so great and the sample size so small  that we were not able to make statistical adjustments to overcome this problem. The following  table shows initial basal areas and volumes as well as the unadjusted eight-year volume growth  for the Ukiah site:  Table 8. Mensurational information for Ukiah fertilization test site  Treatment / Attribute Basal Area Yr 0  (ft2/ac)  Volume Yr 0  (ft3/ac)  Unadjusted Eight  Year Volume  Increment (ft3/ac)  Control 24 169 840  N Fertilization 14 84 497  N+S Fertilization 21 145 702  To further illustrate the tree size problem, the relationship of eight-year volume growth to initial  tree size for the six Ukiah plots was plotted in Figure 3. Table 8 and Figure 3 both indicate that  the initial conditions at Ukiah were the controlling factor in determining eight year growth  response. Had the plots been better matched for initial stand conditions, we might have been  able to detect a fertilizer effect. However, until crown-closure occurs and stand dynamics begin  to control growth of these young stands, we should probably not expect to see fertilizer effects.  Figure 3: Eight-Year Volume Increment vs. Initial  Volume  Ukiah Installation  1000  1200  ment  17  Periodic Growth  Periodic volume growth was analyzed for all four locations, using two-year increments.  The analysis was performed using a repeated measures statement in the general linear models  module of SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 1985). The analysis was performed separately for the three  installation groups (Pomeroy/Pendleton, Heppner, Ukiah). The change in growth over time was  significant for all three groups, while treatment and its interaction with time were non-significant.  Two-year volume increment was plotted for each location and treatment, with the volume  increments calculated as shown in Table 9. In each case, means were calculated for each  location and treatment, and were adjusted to the basal area per location at the start of that period.  The results for the four locations are shown in Figures 4 through 7.  Table 9.

Figure 5 shows similar trends for Pendleton, in that both N and N+S fertilization showed  good initial response, but that by the third and fourth periods, growth on the fertilized plots was  about the same as control plots. The eight-year volume results for Pomeroy and Pendleton,  discussed earlier, indicated that over the entire eight year study period, the N+S treatments  resulted in significantly greater growth than the control plots, and fertilization with N-alone also  tended to show greater growth. The periodic results shown here indicate the growth responses  occurred primarily during the first four to six years of the study. We might therefore expect to  see the fertilizer effect continue to decline over time, unless additional nutrient amendments are  applied.  For the Heppner installations, periodic growth is displayed in relative terms since relative  growth was a better indicator of fertilizer response than absolute growth for the eight-year  analysis. Growth for each two-year period is presented as a percentage of the initial volume for  that period for calculation of periodic response. Since initial volumes were larger at each  successive time period, relative growth decreased, even as absolute growth continued to  increase. Figure 6 shows that volume growth during the first two periods was greatest following  N+S fertilization, compared to both the control and N-only treatments. The control plots showed  somewhat better growth than the N-fertilized plots, however by the third and fourth periods of  the study, there was almost no difference in two-year volume increment between any of the three  treatments. This may be interpreted in a similar fashion as Pomeroy and Pendleton in that the  fertilization effect declined by the 6th and 8th year of the study. Furthermore, the N+S response  reported during the eight-year analysis occurred primarily during the first four to six years of the  study.  20  Figure 6. Heppner Periodic Relative Volume Increment  Figure 5. Ukiah Periodic Relative Volume Increment  Figure 7 shows two-year periodic growth increments for the Ukiah installation. This  figure supports results from the absolute eight-year response, discussed earlier. Growth trends  did not seem to respond to fertilization, but rather to initial size and density conditions. While  the fertilized plots did show growth over the eight year period, their growth did not differ  significantly from control plot growth. The control plots had a greater initial volume than the  fertilized plots, and this pattern continued through the four growth periods.

Ukiah Periodic Volume Increment  Conclusions  Eight-year volume increment following fertilization on the Umatilla National Forest  indicated that overall, the stands responded best to N+S fertilization, but also did well following  application of N only. Basal area and height growth showed results similar to the volume  analyses. The Pomeroy and Pendleton stands were the most straightforward to analyze due to  mature stand conditions. Heppner and Ukiah were more challenging to analyze and understand  due to the problems intrinsic to the measurement and analysis of small trees in open-grown  stands.

INTRODUCTION  Tree seedling fertilization has been a topic of long-standing  research interest in northwestern North America. Fertilization  trials have been established to test not only fertilizer sources,  application rate, application time and placement method but  how these factors interact with stock type and cultural treat-ments  such as site preparation and vegetation control to affect  response magnitude and duration [1, 5, 19]. Steady-state nutri-tion  theory [10–13] suggests that seedling growth and nutrient  uptake can be maximized and leaching losses minimized by  supplying small quantities of nutrients in proportion to require-ments.  Matching seedling growth with nutrient uptake using  exponentially increasing application rates is important for  maintaining steady-state nutrition and stable internal nutrient  concentration in the plants. Short-term experiments with potted  seedlings using nutrient-solution cultures showed that expo-nentially  based fertilization achieved steady-state nutrition and  enhanced plant nutrient status, uptake and growth.  Steady-state nutrition provides information on how to adjust  nutrient loading patterns of conventional fertilization practices  to achieve maximum nutrient uptake and growth performance,  although its implementation with large scale field fertilization  trials is impossible. However, fertilizer efficiency and growth  performance can be improved to some degree if factors contrib-uting  to loss of fertilizer efficiency, such as the rapid dissolution  and hydrolysis of the applied fertilizers, were controlled. Con-trolled-  release fertilizers could be a solution to the low fertili-zation  efficiency and non-significant response observed under  certain circumstances. Several studies have reported slow-release  * Corresponding author: fanzha@missouri.edu  118 Z. Fan et al.  fertilizers effects on tree growth and/or soil chemical properties  [3, 8, 19–21]. [1] summarized research results from Canada  dealing with controlled-release fertilizers incorporated in con-tainer  grown seedling root plugs and pointed out that release rate  and application rate were the key factors determining control-led-  release fertilizer performance.  Application of controlled-release fertilizers is a promising  management practice to ensure rapid establishment of new  plantations in the Inland Northwest. On certain sites, control-led-  release fertilizer could overcome problems usually associ-ated  with soluble fertilizers such as increased mortality caused  by the osmotic effect of high salt concentration in the rooting  zone, intensive competition from vegetation, and contamina-tion  of underground water system and rivers if the products  were formulated and designed appropriately (nutrient compo-sition  and release characteristics), and were applied in a proper  amount, placement method and timing. Moreover, controlled-release  fertilizers may also help decrease the labor cost of  repeated fertilization practices of soluble fertilizers. However,  little information is available currently for conditions and spe-cies  commonly grown in the Inland Northwest of the United  States.  In 1996, the Scotts Company and the Intermountain Forest  Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) at the University of Idaho  cooperatively established an experiment to investigate the  applicability of a number of different controlled-release ferti-lizer  products. The fertilizers were either applied into the root  plug of containerized ponderosa pine stock in the green house  or applied into a hole 15 cm deep and 8 cm away from the plant-ing  point on the uphill side immediately after planting. Signif-icant  growth results were achieved with certain products using  both placement methods on the field test [7, 14]. In this paper,  we present results from incorporating controlled-release ferti-lizers  in the root plug of containerized stock, along with the reg-ular  nursery fertilization regime, on the growth and nutrition  of containerized ponderosa pine stock during the 9-month  growing period. Our hypothesis was that, in the greenhouse,  incorporating extra controlled-release fertilizer might improve  seedling morphological and chemical attributes, which in turn  would improve field performance and establishment of new  ponderosa pine plantations. Specifically, our study investigated  the effect of three types of controlled-release products applied  at three application rates on the growth, nutritional status, and  root growth potential of ponderosa pine seedlings. Based on  these results, we estimate the optimum controlled-release fer-tilizer  application rates for growing containerized ponderosa  pine seedlings in the greenhouse. Results from this experiment  could provide an economically efficient fertilization regime,  including appropriate products and application rates, to ensure  rapid growth and establishment after outplanting.  2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  2.1. Plant materials, controlled-release fertilizers,  and growing environment  Three types of controlled-release fertilizers (Tab. I) were tested at  application rates of 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 g per seedling. The containers used  for growing ponderosa pine seedlings were the160/90 styroblock  (160 90-cm3 cells per tray). A completely randomized design includ-ing  10 treatments (3 formulations × 3 application rates and 1 control),  each with 4 replicates (trays) was used in the experiment. For the three  application rates, 128, 256, and 512 g of each of three controlled-release  fertilizers were first fully mixed with a 0.014 m3 of the 50/50  percent peat-vermiculite growing media. Container cells were then  hand filled with the mixture of growing media and fertilizers on Feb-ruary  24th, 1996. For the control treatment, no controlled-release prod-ucts  were incorporated in the growing media. Ponderosa pine seeds,  collected from natural stands in northern Idaho within the same seed  transfer zone as the planting site, were sown at 3 seeds/cell with a vac-uum  seeder and covered with about 0.6 cm of Target Forestry Sand®  on March 1st. Once sowing was complete, the containers were irri-gated  until the media was thoroughly moist. Phosphoric acid was  injected into the irrigation water to adjust pH to around 6.0. The seed  germination process was completed by March 22nd and cells were then  thinned to one seedling per cell when most seedlings shed their seed  coats. During the growth phase (from March to June), day tempera-tures  of 24–27 °C and night temperatures around 18 °C were main-tained.  Photoperiod was extended to 24 h in the greenhouse by using  iridescent bulbs. In addition to the fertilization treatments, the regular  nursery-based liquid fertilizer solution was also applied during twice-weekly  irrigations through an overhead traveling boom system. Top  dressing rates and nutrient compositions for the regular nursery ferti-lization  regime were adjusted based on seedling growth phases. The  growing regime for ponderosa pine is described in detail in [22].  2.2. Measurement of root-collar diameter, height,  biomass, root growth potential, and foliar nutrient  concentrations of ponderosa pine seedlings  Root-collar diameter and height (from the root collar to the base  of the dominant bud) were measured at the end of each month starting  from March to September through a systematic sample of 32 seedlings  for each treatment (8 seedlings per replicate). At lifting (December 1,  1996), these seedlings were then cut at the root collar, and the root sys-tem  was extracted from the container and hand washed. The shoot was  separated into needles and stem. The needle, stem and root samples  were weighed after oven drying at 70 °C for 48 h. The shoot/root ratio  was calculated as the shoot (needle + stem) mass to the root mass. Needle  Table I.

Foliar nitrogen was determined using a  standard mico-Kjeldahl procedure. Phosphorus, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Mo,  Fe, Cu and Zn were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)  emission with digested plant tissue.  The remaining seedlings from each treatment were wrapped with  plastic in bundles of 20 after lifting and placed into polylined wax  boxes for cold storage. The refrigerated storage is kept at 0.5 °C with  relative humidity near 100 percent. Seedlings were then outplanted in  late April of the next year (1997). [14] described in detail the field  experimental design and seedling growth during the first 2 years .  Before outplanting, thirty-two seedlings for each treatment were  randomly selected for root growth potential testing. A completely ran-domized  design with four replicates was employed. Seedlings were  placed in 3.78-liter pots filled with the 50/50 percent peat-vermiculite  growing media and grown in the same greenhouse environment as  before. Seedlings were watered to maintain the maximum water-hold-ing  potential for the media. The root growth potential experiment  ended four weeks later after 80% of the buds had broken dormancy.  Roots were extracted from the pots and the medium was washed care-fully  from them. Root growth potential index was evaluated based on  the following criteria [2]: 0: no new roots growth; 1: some new roots  but none over 1 cm long; 2: 1–3 new roots over 1 cm long; 3: 4–10 new  roots over 1 cm long; 4: 11–30 new roots over 1 cm long; 5: &gt; 30 new  roots over 1 cm long.  3. DATA ANALYSIS  3.1. Seedling growth  We employed the Chapman-Richards growth function [4, 9,  16, 17] of the form:  (1)  to study the growth of ponderosa pine seedling’s stem diameter  (D), height (H) and volume (V, approximately calculated as  πD2H/4) under different fertilization treatments. Where y rep-resents  the stem diameter (mm), height (cm) or volume (cm3),  t is the time (month) since seeding (March 1, 1996), and A, k,  and m are the parameters to be estimated. To block out the  potential effect from seed quality and the cell-to-cell variation  in the amount of controlled-release fertilizers due to the cell fill-ing  method, stem diameter, height and volume means for each  replicate (y) were used rather than stem diameter, height and  volume of individual seedlings. Therefore, we have 4 data  points for each response variable corresponding to each of the  7 measuring dates, respectively. We set the initial (March 1,  1996, seeding) stem diameter, height and volume as zero and  included this point in our model fitting process. We also cal-culated  the maximum growth rate (Ymax) and the time (Tmax)  at the inflection point for each growth curve using equations (2)  and (3) based on the estimated A, k, and m.  (2)  . (3)  We used the NLIN procedure [15] to fit model (1). We esti-mated  the initial value of parameters A, k and m as 3.9, 0.5 and  0.3, and 17, 0.9 and 0.7, and 3.0, 0.7 and 0.5 for D, H and V,  respectively, and used the Gauss-Newton iterative method to  achieve the best least square fit.  3.2. Mass production, allocation, foliar nutrient status,  and root growth potential  A generalized linear model (GLM) shown by (4) was  employed to analyze the fertilization effect on final seedling  stem diameter, height, total mass, shoot/root ratio and foliar  nutrient concentrations.  Yij = μ +treai + εij (i = 1, …, 10; j = 1, …, 4) (4)  where Yij is the average seedling stem diameter, height, total  mass, shoot/root ratio, or foliar nutrient concentrations for rep-licate  j of treatment i, μ is the grand mean, treai is the fixed effect  for treatment i, and εij is the error effect and is assumed to fol-low  N(0, σ2). Pairwise comparison of treatment means were  performed using the Ryan-Gabriel-Welsch (RGWQ) multiple-range  test at the experimental error rate p = 0.05. Correlation  between the seedling size at lifting in the greenhouse and at the  end of the 2-year field test was generally evaluated using Pear-son’s  correlation coefficient. Root growth potential data were  analyzed using the PROC FREQ of SAS [15].  3.3. Estimating application rates for growing  containerized ponderosa pine seedlings  with maximum stem diameter and height  Regression of the final seedling stem diameter and height  on fertilizer application rates was conducted for each control-led-  release product using a parabolic model of the form:  Yi = a0 + a1 X + a2X2 + εi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) (5)  where Yi is the average root-collar diameter (mm) or height  (cm) for replicate i, X is the application rate, a0, a1 and a2 are  the regression parameters, and εi is the random error. The esti-mated  application rate associated with maximum caliper and  height for each fertilizer type was calculated via differentiation  as follows:  estimated application rate = –â1 / (2 â2 ). (6)  For simplicity in the presentation of results, we use CTR to  represent the control (no controlled release fertilizer added),  and FR-0.8, FR-1.6, and FR-3.2 to represent the 0.8, 1.6 and  3.2 g per seedling of the FR fertilizer treatments. The moderate  release (MR) and slow release (SR) treatments are similarly  designated.  4. RESULTS  Stem diameter, height and volume growth of ponderosa pine  seedlings under all fertilizer treatments in the green house was  well described by the Chapman-Richards function (Fig. 1 and  Tab. II); no evidence of detectable residual patterns and lack-of-  fit were found with the fitted models (p &lt; 0.001).

Fan et al.  and height growth were not evident until May (third month after  sowing), yet the controlled-release fertilizer treatment effect on  stem volume was detected by early April, one month after sow-ing.  Stem height and volume growth of seedlings treated with  controlled-release fertilizers accelerated until the end of June  (bud initiation, fourth month after sowing); subsequently, stem  height and volume approached the plateau and gained little  from controlled-release fertilizer treatment. Stem diameter  growth, however, continually accelerated until late September  (seventh month after sowing, Fig. 1). The inflection point of the  stem diameter, height, and volume growth curves was located  in early or middle April (1 &lt; Tmax &lt; 2), and there was no dif-ference  among treatments (Tab. II). The maximum growth rate  of stem height and volume of seedlings treated with controlled-release  fertilizer was larger than the control, but the maximum  treated seedling stem diameter growth rate was not different  from the control.  At lifting, controlled-release fertilizer treatments as a group  produced larger stem diameter (3.2 ~ 3.6 mm), height (16.6 ~  18.0 cm) and total mass (3.2 ~ 4.6 g) than the control treatment  Figure 1.

Growth and nutrition of ponderosa pine 121  (2.8 mm, 14.8 cm and 2.3 g, respectively) (p &lt; 0.01). Fertilized  seedlings were 14–29, 15–22, and 39–100% larger than the  controls. Pairwise comparisons of treatment means further  showed that all treatments with FR product produced signifi-cantly  larger stem diameter, height and total mass than the con-trol  treatment. However, for the MR and SR products, only the  moderate level (1.6 g per seedling) always produced significantly  larger stem diameter, height and total mass compared to the  control treatment. Certain low and/or high levels (0.8 and 3.2 g  per seedling, respectively) of MR or SR product were not sig-nificantly  different from the controls in stem diameter, height  or total mass (Tab. III).  The shoot/root ratio of ponderosa pine seedlings treated with  controlled-release fertilizer increased as application rate  increased. The ratios ranged from 2.8 ~ 3.7 compared to 2.2 for  the control treatment (Tab. III). One-way analysis of variance  indicated that controlled-release fertilizer treatments as a group  significantly increased shoot/root ratio (p = 0.015). But, the  comparison of treatment means found that only the FR-3.2  treatment was statistically different from the control.  Overall, foliar concentrations of N (p = 0.0010), Mg (p =  0.0210), B (p &lt; 0.0001), Cu (p &lt; 0.0001), Fe (p = 0.0011) and  Mo (p = 0.0155) were significantly affected by controlled-release  fertilizer treatments. Comparison of foliar nutrient con-centration  means showed that certain treatments (i.e., MR-3.2,  SR-3.2 and SR-0.8) were significantly different from the con-trol  for foliar B, Cu and Fe concentrations. Foliar N, Mg and  Mo concentrations differed only among controlled-release fer-tilizer  treatments. No significant differences (p = 0.05) among  treatments were found for other nutrients (Tab. IV).  After 5 months of cold storage, root growth potential of pon-derosa  pine seedlings treated with 3.2 g of MR or SR product  was significantly lower than the control as well as all other con-trolled-  release fertilizer treatments (Tab. III). A large number  of dead root plugs were found with the 3.2 g of MR or SR treat-ments.  Treatment FR-0.8 produced more seedlings with root  growth potential indexes in categories 4 and 5 than other treat-ments;  however, the differences were not statistically signifi-cant  at p = 0.05.

Fan et al.  by measuring weight loss before and after cold storage showed  that nutrients were continuously released from the fertilizer pel-lets  during cool storage. The amount of nutrients released from  3.2 g of MR and SR fertilizer was 0.295 (9.21%) and 0.142  (4.43%) g, respectively.  As indicated by the growth curves (Fig. 1) or by the final  seedling size (Tab. III), there was larger variation among the  three application rates of MR or SR compared to FR. Caliper  and height means for the 1.6 gm rate were both largest among  the three application rates for the MR and SR fertilizer types.  The application rates which produced the maximum caliper and  height growth were 2.2 g for the MR product and 2.0 g for the  SR product, respectively, based on parabolic regression results of  caliper and height on the application rates for the MR and SR  fertilizer products and calculations from equation (6). Residual  analysis showed no detectable pattern when fitting equation (5)  to the data and the lack-of-fit was non-significant. Since all  rates of the FR product produced about the same average caliper  and height, we did not estimate a “maximum response” appli-cation  rate. However, total mass favors the 0.8 g per tree rate.  Correlation analysis showed the seedling size (diameter and  height) two years after outplanting was strongly positively cor-related  with the final greenhouse seedling size (Tab. V).  5. DISCUSSION  Matching plant/seedling growth with nutrient uptake and  maintaining stable internal nutrient concentration has been a  topic of interest for many studies (e.g., [10–13]) to improve fer-tilization  efficiency and to prevent nutrient deficiency, toxicity  or environmental contamination due to rapid dissolution and  hydrolysis. Controlled-release fertilizers could be a solution to  rapid dissolution and hydrolysis by gradually providing seed-lings  with nutrients over a longer time period, although it was  extraordinarily difficult or even impossible to achieve the ideal  steady-state nutrition in real fertilization operations due to the  technical difficulty in matching nutrient release rate and stock  growth. However, the concept of steady-state nutrition pointed  the direction for the design, formulation and application of con-trolled-  release products. Thus, the practical significance of this  study was testing the applicability of incorporating extra con-trolled-  release fertilizer in the root plug under the regular nursery  fertilization regime to grow high quality containerized ponde-rosa  pine stock. This fertilization regime as a new nutrient  uploading method may prevent the extreme nutrient deficiency  or toxicity conditions, thus maintaining a reasonable stock  nutritional status (range) to stimulate stock growth over a long  period.  The three release products (FR, MR and SR) used in this  study were formulated to incorporate both macro- and micro-nutrients  inside the coating material as shown in Table I. The  fertilizers were designed to release nutrients over a period of  9, 12~14, and 16~20 months, respectively. As shown by Figure 1  and Table II, ponderosa pine seedling growth was signifi-cantly  improved by the incorporated controlled-release ferti-lizers.  The magnitude varied by product (release period) and  the application rate. The final stem diameter, height and total  mass averaged over the three application rates of each control-led-  release product showed that FR was superior to MR, and  MR was superior to SR. This was most probably because the  release period of FR matched the 9-month greenhouse seedling  production period (from March to November); FR provided  Table IV.

However, the  effect of product release period may have been compensated  for in part by the application rate. For example, with the  medium application rate the variation in diameter, height and  total mass between FR, MR and SR was much smaller than that  with the low and high application rates (Tab. II). This suggests  that the medium application rate of these three products well  matched the nutrient uptake process during the nine-month  growing period. For the FR product, 0.8 g per seedling was best  for height growth, while caliper and total mass growth did not  increase with higher application rates of this fertilizer. This  result was likely due to the additional nutrients leaching out of  the container early in the growing season before they were  needed and could be absorbed by the seedlings. For the MR or  SR products, stem diameter, height and total mass growth pat-terns  were similar, with the medium application rate exceeding  the low and high application rates. The medium application rate  of these two products produced significantly larger diameter,  height and total mass than the control treatment, while certain  low and high application rates did not. A probable interpreta-tion  of these results is that the low application rate of these two  products provided inadequate nutrients during the early rapid  seedling growth as indicated by Figure 1 and the high applica-tion  rate was too high and poorly matched seedling growth  requirements.  Large seedlings are usually desirable to overcome vegeta-tion  competition on the reforestation site, and can shorten the  plantation establishment period. However, other planting stock  quality characteristics such as shoot/root ratio or nutritional sta-tus  were also important to the field performance of the planted  stock and reforestation success, particularly on harsh sites [21].  Low shoot/root ratios favored field survival, root growth poten-tial  and improved growth potential on dry sites [18]. In the  Inland Northwest, many reforestation sites experience a very  dry period from mid-July until late September. Soil moistures  at the seedling root zone (10–40 cm depth) during this period  were below 25% [7]. Outplanting is conducted either before or  after the dry period and morphologically and physiologically  suitable containerized stock should be used for reforestation in  this region [6]. In our study, seedling growth was improved sig-nificantly  by most controlled-release fertilizer treatments, but  the shoot/root ratio, root growth potential and foliar nutritional  status of seedlings treated with the low and moderate applica-tion  rates of FR, MR or SR were not significantly different from  those treated with the regular nursery fertilization regime (the  control) (Tabs. III and IV). The regular nursery fertilization  regime was designed to produce high-quality commercial con-tainerized  ponderosa pine stock for reforestation in north cen-tral  Idaho [22]. Using the seedlings grown under the regular  nursery fertilization regime as a reference, we quantitatively  compared the effects of controlled-release products and appli-cation  rates on major morphological and physiological traits.  All these results indicate that both release rate and application  rate should be carefully considered to achieve an optimum  nutrient supply needed to grow larger seedlings with adequate  nutrition.  Compared with a study on a neighboring site where controlled-release  products were applied adjacent to seedlings immedi-ately  after planting, incorporating the controlled-release prod-uct  in the root plugs of containerized ponderosa pine stock in  the nursery probably is a more efficient method in terms of field  growth performance. Root plug fertilized seedlings were taller  and had larger stem diameter during the first two years after out-planting  [7, 14]. We found that the difference in seedling stem  diameter and height after two years between these two fertili-zation  placement methods was mainly due to initial size differ-ences  of the planting stock (Tab. V) since the relative growth  rate of seedlings treated by these two placement methods are  comparable after outplanting [7, 14]. However, one potential  problem with incorporating controlled-release fertilizers in  container seedling root plugs is continuous nutrient release dur-ing  cold storage. This release can cause high salinity buildup  and toxicity, which in turn causes serious damage to seedling  root systems [1]. Results of our root growth potential test con-firmed  this point. The MR-3.2 and SR-3.2 treatments caused  much lower root growth potential than the same rate of FR fer-tilizer.  This result was likely related to longer release periods  for the MR and SR fertilizers. Our test of the MR and SR fer-tilizers  release during cold storage supports the idea that con-tinuous  nutrient release and subsequent salinity buildup in the  root plug are a possible reason for the lower root growth poten-tial.  This result suggests that for MR and SR fertilizers the 3.2 g  per seedling rate is too high. Two years after planting, the seed-ling  survival rate for these two treatments was only 45 and 63%,  which was significantly lower than any other treatment [14].  Therefore, when incorporating controlled-release fertilizer in  the root plug, the release characteristics and application rate of  controlled-release products must be well matched to the size of  the containerized stock and nursery growing regime to achieve  a better field survival rate. Given these small containers, lower  application rates and shorter release periods should be used to  prevent root damage when cold storage is required before out-planting.  Longer fertilizer release periods may be appropriate  if fall planting is used, thereby avoiding cold storage. Incorpo-rating  controlled-release fertilizers in the root plug of the con-tainerized  stock is a practical way to increase seedling size  without dramatically changing desirable morphological and  physiological traits such as shoot/root ratio, root growth poten-tial  and foliar nutrient status, if fertilizer nutrient release char-acteristics  and application rates are correctly selected.  6. CONCLUSIONS  Controlled-release fertilizer placed in the container at the  time of sowing increased diameter, needle, stem and total bio-mass  of ponderosa pine seedlings at lifting in the greenhouse.  Seedlings with controlled-release fertilizer incorporated in the  root plug had larger stem diameter, height and total mass than  seedlings with no controlled-release fertilizer incorporated.  The estimated dosage to achieve maximum caliper and height  in the greenhouse was 2.2 and 2.0 g per seedling for MR and  SR fertilizer, respectively, while for FR fertilizer, the 0.8 g per  seedling rate was best.  Seedlings treated with controlled-release fertilizer had  larger shoot/root ratios compared to untreated seedlings, but the  differences were not significant for all treatments except FR-  3.2. Seedlings treated with FR had a more balanced nutritional  status than seedlings fertilized with MR or SR. Differences  124 Z. Fan et al.  between MR and SR were not evident. Micro-nutrient deficien-cies  were more severe than macro-nutrients with either the MR  or SR fertilizers. The MR-3.2 and SR-3.2 treatments resulted  in much lower root growth potential probably due to toxicity  caused by continuous nutrient release before or during cold  storage. Many dead root plugs were found for these two treat-ments.  The release period of the fast release fertilizer more  closely matched the nursery’s growing season length compared  to longer release products. The FR product was therefore gen-erally  more effective in producing larger seedlings with well-balanced  biomass components.

[Traduit par la Rédaction] Moore et al. 42  Introduction  Effective forest management decisions require accurate  growth and yield models that provide reliable growth infor-mation.  A typical growth and yield model usually includes  three components: survivor growth, ingrowth, and mortality.  Mortality is the most difficult of these components to accu-rately  predict. Hamilton’s (1986) work substantially ad-vanced  our ability to predict mortality by relating individual  tree mortality probability to (i) tree size, (ii) stand density,  (iii) individual tree competition, and (iv) tree growth rate.  While these tree and stand variables are useful for explain-ing  variation in mortality, substantial variation remains un-explained  in most mortality prediction models.  Rock type has been shown to significantly affect the  growth and mortality rates of individual trees following fer-tilization  of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga  menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) (Shen et al. 2000,  2001). Their results suggested that different rock types rep-resented  broad differences in the forest nutrient environment.  We particularly wanted to learn about differences in nutrient  ecology for conifers commonly occurring in inland North-west  forests. Therefore, we undertook the current study to  determine if rock type could explain additional variation in  Can. J. For.

Furthermore, we wanted to ascertain whether various  tree species show different mortality rates on certain rock  types.  Materials and methods  Data  Tree mortality data used in this study include the data de-scribed  in Hamilton (1986). In addition, data from a regen-eration  development study established in the late 1970s  (Ferguson et al. 1986) and data from unfertilized control  plots described by Shen et al. (2000, 2001) and obtained  from the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative  were combined with Hamilton’s (1986) original data, thus  expanding the range of conditions sampled, particularly for  rock type. Collectively, the time periods included in the data  span much of the 20th century, beginning in 1914 and con-tinuing  into the 1990s. Therefore, these data represent the  wide range of climatic variation included in the more than  80-year time span. The average time period between succes-sive  measurements of these permanent sample plots was  6 years. Plots range in size from 0.02 to 0.87 ha. Hamilton  (1986), Ferguson et al. (1986), and Shen et al. (2000) pro-vided  detailed descriptions of the data sets used in our cur-rent  study. The combined data set consists of 194 permanent  sample plots in the inland Northwest (Fig. 1). Site and stand  conditions for the overall data set are summarized in Ta-ble  1. The range of conditions included in these data spans  much of the natural variability encountered in the region.  Bedrock samples were collected from soil pits (from the C  horizon if present) at each Intermountain Forest Tree Nutri-tion  Cooperative location and, after examination by a geolo-gist,  each installation was assigned to one of six rock type  categories: granite, basalt, metasedimentary, sedimentary,  mixed – glacial till, or deep deposit. For the rest of the data,  each plot was first located on the appropriate geology map  (Burmester et al. 2001; Munts and Idaho Geological Survey  2000; Miller et al. 1999; Lewis and Derkey 1999; Lewis et  al. 1999; Idaho Geological Survey 1996) and the plot as-signed  to one of the six categories. Then, a substantial num-ber  of plots, about 20% of the total in these two data sets,  were field checked, particularly those located near rock type  boundaries on the geology maps. Rock samples were also  collected from soil pits and examined by a geologist to ver-ify  the rock type. The misclassification of bedrock geology  based on the geology map identification compared with the  field verification rock samples was about 15%. We used the  geology maps to assign bedrock type for the remaining  study plots.  The six bedrock categories are so broadly defined that  each bedrock type can be fairly easily distinguished in the  field, and thus, the categories are potentially useful for forest  management applications. However, each rock type category  includes substantial geochemical and mineralogical variation  in the rocks. Furthermore, each bedrock category represents  very large land areas spanning major watersheds in the re-gion  and each category includes wide variation in site attrib-utes  such as elevation and slope (Table 2). Misclassification  of bedrock type derived from our use of geology maps cou-pled  with variation within rock type categories will likely  increase the magnitude of the error term in our subsequent  statistical analyses, thus making it more difficult to demon-strate  statistical significance for rock type as a classification  variable.  As expected, since glacial deposits are usually located in  valley bottoms, the mixed rock type showed the lowest aver-age  sample plot elevation (Table 2). Plots located on granite  bedrocks had the highest average elevation as well as the  most variability in elevation. Metasedimentary rocks were  somewhat steeper than other rock types, while they, along  with deep deposits, had the highest proportion of plots lo-cated  on western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.)  habitat series.  Deep deposits are really a collection of surficial deposits  (not including glacial tills) that are not truly a bedrock type.  They were generally deposited by water, have sandy texture,  and are excessively well drained. They are so deep that we  assume trees growing on them are little affected by the un-derlying  hard rock, and thus, they formed a separate rock  type category. Habitat type (Pfister et al. 1977) was deter-mined  on site for each plot and each plot was assigned to  one of five habitat type categories: grand fir (Abies grandis  (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menz-iesii  (Mirb.) Franco), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.)  Nutt.), western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex. D. Don),  and western hemlock.  The number of observations by species, rock type, and  habitat type for the analysis data set is provided in Table 3.  For all species, metasedimentary rocks were the most com-mon.  Sixty-four percent of the plots are on western hemlock  habitat types. Western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl.  ex D. Don), Douglas-fir, grand fir, western redcedar, western  hemlock, and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) had  sufficiently large sample size to be analyzed separately.  Other species were sampled so infrequently that they were  grouped into a single category. Not all rock types were rep-resented  for each tree species. Western hemlock was not  sampled on basalt or sedimentary rocks, while western white  pine was not sampled on basalts.  Analysis: mortality model  Our primary objective was to test whether individual tree  mortality rates differed significantly by rock type. The logis-tic  function was chosen to model individual tree mortality in  our study. Model development was based on both biological  and statistical considerations. The RISK software (Hamilton  1974), which fits the linear logistic regression model for bi-nary  data by the method of maximum likelihood, was used  to model individual tree mortality as a logistic function of  site, tree size, and competition following the biological ra-tionale  of Hamilton (1986) and Monserud and Sterba (1999).

Bedrock type has been shown to be an important factor af-fecting  stand-level growth response to N fertilization (Moore  et al. 1998) and could represent differences in the forest nu-tritional  environment (Shen et al. 2000, 2001). Therefore,  rock effects were included in the individual tree mortality  model as a set of dummy variables (RC) (eq. 2).  In the size effect eq. 3, DBH is a useful and reliable mea-sure  of a tree’s size. Generally, the larger the tree, the greater  its chances of effectively competing for scarce resources,  indicating that the probability of mortality decreases with in-creasing  DBH. Thus, many mortality models include this  variable (e.g., Monserud 1976; Buchman et al. 1983; Van-clay  1991; McTague and Stansfield 1994; Monserud and  Sterba 1999). The 1/DBH term allows the mortality model  to estimate accurately the large mortality rates for small  trees (Hamilton 1986). Average annual individual tree diam-eter  growth rate for the preceding measurement period is a  measure of individual tree vigor and has been shown to be a  significant predictor of tree mortality (Hamilton 1986) and is  therefore included in eq. 3. Generally, the probability of  mortality decreases with increasing individual tree growth  rate.  In the combined competition effect (eq. 4), overall stand  density effects are represented in the mortality model by BA  (Hamilton 1986). Furthermore, the probability of a tree dy-ing  within the next growing period is also likely dependent  on its competitive status relative to neighboring trees, repre-sented  in the model by the BAL term (Wykoff et al. 1982;  Wykoff 1990). Variable measurement period lengths in the  data were dealt with by treating survival as a compound in-terest  phenomenon. This is accomplished by inclusion of  LGP in eq. 1 (Monserud 1976; Hamilton 1986).

Table 4 (concluded).  Bedrock type effects on mortality for four of the tree spe-cies  studied, representing a range of shade tolerance, are il-lustrated  in Fig. 3. Douglas-fir and western white pine  mortality rates are significantly affected by rock type, while  western hemlock and western larch are not significantly af-fected  (Table 4). Douglas-fir mortality rate is highest on  metasedimentary rocks (2.8%·year–1) and lowest on basalt  and sedimentary rocks (each 0.3%·year–1). Western white  pine mortality is highest on deep deposits and also very high  on metasedimentary rocks (4.2%·year–1), while it is lowest  on granites (1.3%·year–1). Western hemlock mortality rates  are relatively low across all four rock types sampled, ranging  from 0.8% to 1.4% annually. Western larch mortality rates  are about the same for all rock types. Although not presented  in Fig. 3, grand fir mortality rates are not significantly af-fected  by rock type, and western redcedar mortality rates are  significantly higher on mixed and sedimentary rocks than on  metasedimentary or granite bedrocks (Table 4).  Response surface diagrams representing the combined tree  size and competitive status (BAL) effects on mortality rates  are provided for four species growing on metasedimentary  rocks in Fig. 4. A subject tree’s competitive status decreases  as BAL increases, assuming that other factors remain con-stant.  Therefore, the upper right corner of each panel in  Fig. 4 represents small, suppressed trees, while the lower left  corner represents large, dominant trees (i.e., those with large  DBH and low BAL). The response surface shapes corre-spond  to the four species’ relative shade tolerances. For the  very shade-intolerant western larch, small trees with high  BAL have a low chance of survival; however, large dominant  western larch have low mortality rates (Fig. 4a).

Western  white pine and Douglas-fir are intermediate in shade toler-ance  between western larch and western hemlock, as are  their DBH and BAL response surface diagrams (Figs. 4b  and 4c).  Discussion  The mortality prediction equations developed in this study  could eventually be used with individual tree growth simula-tion  models, such as the forest vegetation simulator (Wykoff  et al. 1982), which is widely used to forecast growth and  yield in the inland Northwest. However, before these equa-tions  could be used in the forest vegetation simulator, other  component models, such as individual tree increment mod-els,  should also be modified to include rock type effects.  Other statistical considerations, such as errors in variables,  may also be important in evaluating model prediction prop-erties.  We are primarily interested in describing the quantitative  ecology for the conifer species in our study rather than mor-tality  prediction per se. Our results show that western white  pine, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar mortality rates were  significantly affected by rock type, while grand fir, western  hemlock, and western larch were not affected. Why do some  rock types produce different mortality rates for some species  and not for others? The answer probably depends on both  rock attributes and tree species characteristics. It is difficult  to generalize about the high mortality rates on the deep de-posit  “rock” category, since it is composed of various  surficial deposits. We speculate that these generally sandy  soils provide a poor nutrient and moisture environment for  tree growth.  Shen et al. (2001) and Moore et al. (2004) demonstrated  that trees growing on different rock types have different fo-liar  nutrient concentrations, particularly for K. Trees grown  on metasedimentary rocks had the lowest foliar K concentra-tions,  while trees on basalts and sedimentary rocks showed  the highest foliar concentrations.  Geochemical analyses of rock samples collected from 10  Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative research  sites distributed throughout the inland Northwest are notice-ably  different by rock type (Fig. 5). The SiO2 content of  metasedimentary rocks sampled is much higher than for bas-alts  (83% versus 52%, respectively), while important min-eral  nutrients such as Fe, Ca, and Mg are proportionately  lower for metasedimentary rocks. Some metasedimentary  rocks have SiO2 content in excess of 90%, with proportion-ately  lower contents for other mineral nutrients. However,  basalts have somewhat lower average K content than granite  and metasedimentary rocks. Rock mineral nutrient content is  important but not the only factor influencing forest tree nu-trient  availability. For example, rock weathering rates and  different soil physical properties derived from different rocks  are also important determinants of the forest nutrient envi-ronment.  Soils derived from basaltic and sedimentary rocks  tend to be richer in clay minerals and have a higher cation-exchange  capacities, and granite rocks tend to weather to  sandy soils, with low cation-exchange capacities (Buol et al.  1989). Many metasedimentary rocks weather very slowly  due to high silica content and a mineralogic composition  containing a high proportion of residual products from previ-ous  rock weathering (Birkeland 1999).  We believe that metasedimentary rocks provide trees with  a poor nutrient supply, thus accounting for high mortality  rates on these rocks. Our supposition that high mortality  rates on metasedimentary rocks are nutritionally related  rather than explained by some other site factor associated  © 2003 NRC Canada  38 Can. J. For. Res. Vol. 34, 2004  Fig. 2. Predicted average annual individual tree mortality rates from eq. 1 for each species in the inland Northwest.  with this bedrock type is supported by the data in Table 2.  Although the slopes where sample plots occurred on meta-sedimentary  rocks were somewhat steeper than for other  rock types, the average elevation for the metasedimentary  plots is near the mean elevation for all rock types. Impor-tantly,  the majority of metasedimentary plots were situated  on western hemlock habitat series, which represent the  moistest growing conditions in the region (Daubenmire and  Daubenmire 1968; Pfister et al. 1977; Cooper et al. 1991).  Therefore, in theory, trees on western hemlock habitat types  should experience less moisture stress than those growing on  other habitat type series. Even though metasedimentary plots  are generally located in relatively high-moisture areas, they  still produce significantly higher tree mortality rates for  western white pine and Douglas-fir.  Our results, with respect to tree mortality differences by  rock type, support those of Shen et al. (2001) and indicate  that rock type represents broad differences in the nutrient en-vironment  where trees grow. A biological explanation for the  mortality rate relationships may be that tree nutrient status  differs by rock type, thus producing tree biochemical differ-ences  resulting in different tree susceptibility levels to dis-eases  and insects (Mika and Moore 1991; Entry et al. 1991;  Shaw et al. 1998; Shen et al. 2001).  Little has been published regarding the nutrient require-ments  of western white pine and western larch, particularly  for forest-grown, mature trees. Some information regarding  nutrient regimes used by seedling nurseries for growing the  two species is available. Western white pine requires sub-stantial  nutrient inputs during a greenhouse growing regime,  while western larch requires less nutrients than any other  western conifer (D.L. Wenny, Professor, Forest Resources,  College of Natural Resources, University of Idaho, personal  communication). Interior Douglas-fir has been shown to be  very responsive to nutrient status changes following fertiliza-tion  (Shafii et al. 1989, 1990; Moore et al. 1991, 1994,  1998) and, by inference, should be a nutrient-demanding  species. Western hemlock may have lower nutrient require-ments  than some species or be very efficient in acquiring re-quired  nutrients.  We surmise based on the above information that western  larch and western hemlock would be less affected by the  amount of nutrients available on a site, and thus by rock  type, than western white pine or Douglas-fir. Regardless of  the true nutrient requirement rankings of the species in our  study, rock type affected western white pine and Douglas-fir  more than western larch and western hemlock. Grand fir  mortality rates across rock types had a pattern similar to  hemlock. Sedimentary and mixed rocks produced the highest  mortality rate for western redcedar, unlike the mortality pat-tern  for other species.  The DBH–BAL mortality response surface shapes (Fig. 4)  correspond to species relative shade tolerance rankings. The  degree of upward sloping for the mortality surface decreases  with increasing shade tolerance. For shade-intolerant west-ern  larch, large dominant western larch have low mortality  rates, while suppressed western larch have very high mortal-ity  rates (Fig. 4a). The response surface for shade-tolerant  western hemlock is flat, indicating low mortality rates for all  DBH and BAL combinations (Fig. 4d). Our results show that  both rock type and suppression substantially contribute to  explaining mortality for western white pine and Douglas-fir,  while most western larch mortality occurred in small sup-pressed  trees across all rock types. Western hemlock mortal-ity  rates were low across all rock types, even for small,  suppressed trees. In addition, our data suggest that western  white pine blister rust may be more common on meta-sedimentary  rocks (and deep deposits), since blister rust is  the most common mortality factor for western white pine  and mortality rates are highest for these rock types. Our data  come from natural western white pine stands, not from se-lected  genotypes bred for genetic resistance to western white  pine blister rust. Western white pine’s average annual mor-tality  rate of 4.2% on metasedimentary rocks means that, on  © 2003 NRC Canada  Moore et al. 39  Fig. 3. Predicted average annual individual tree mortality rates  from eq. 1 by species and rock type in the inland Northwest.  average, only 34% of the western white pine would survive  after 25 years. These remarkably high mortality rates are  supported by the estimates provided by Fins et al. (2002) for  unimproved western white pine across various rock types.  The ecological implications of our results are that western  hemlock would eventually dominate stands where it occurs,  particularly on “nutrient-poor” rocks like metasedimentary  types, while other species (except for large dominant west-ern  larch and western redcedar) would have much lower sur-vival.  These generalities are confirmed by the composition  of undisturbed older stands currently occurring in the inland  Northwest. Perhaps rock type plays an important role, in ad-dition  to moisture and temperature, in determining climax  vegetation on a site and therefore habitat type land classifi-cations  such as described in Pfister et al. (1977).  Conclusions  The combined tree size (DBH) and competitive status  (BAL) effects on individual tree mortality rates correspond  to species relative shade tolerance rankings. For shade-intolerant  western larch, large dominant trees have low mor-tality  rates, while small, suppressed trees have very high  mortality rates. The mortality response surface for all DBH  and BAL combinations for shade-tolerant western hemlock  is flat, with low mortality rates. Western white pine and  Douglas-fir response surface shapes are intermediate be-tween  those of larch and hemlock.

Fertilization has been an important practice used to improve nutrient status and production of containerized tree seedlings. Some nursery fertilization practices call for application of fertilizers in a single dose at the stmi of the tree growing cycle or in equal amounts as top dressing through the growth regime. Such fertilization regimes can result in leaching and cause negative effects on seedling growth due to initial toxicity from over-fertilization, followed by deficiency because nutrient supply does not match the absorption rates of the rapidly growing seedlings. Based on a series ofplant nutrition experiments using solution culture techniques, Ingestad (1974) proposed the concept of steady-state nutrition wherein plants are free ofnutrient stress and are thus able to maintain a stabIe internal nutrient concentration by matching nutrient supply to the nutrient uptake required to support seedling growth and biomass accumulation. Implementation of this concept has proved successful in enhancing growth and improving early outplanting perfOlmance of conifer seedlings (Timmer and Miller 1991).  As suggested by Imo and Timmer (1992), ""steady-state"" nutrition can be achieved, and a tree's nutrient status improved, using exponentially based fertilization schedules. A potentially efficient method for achieving steady-state nutrition would be to incorporate slow-release fertilizer in the root plug at the time of sowing. Carefully controlling release rate, nutrient composition, and application rate of slow-release fertilizers could improve the nutrient status of container-grown tree seedlings. Furthermore, this practice could also avoid additional fertilization at planting. 4  Thus, the major objective of our study was to quantify the nutrient status ofponderosa pine seedlings at the end ofone growing season in the nursery using nutrient vector analysis of seedling foliage and root tissue samples. Graphical vector analyses allow comprehensive evaluation ofpotential effects of fertilizer release rates, nutrient composition and application rates on seedling nutrient status. This infonnation would be useful for fertilizer manufacturers to fonnulate and nursery managers to use products with desirable release rates and nutrient composition that produce balanced tree nutrition.  Materials and Methods Experimental design  Three controlled-release feliilizer products characterized by different release rates and nutrient compositions (Table 1) were incorporated in the growth medium at rates of 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 grams per seedling prior to sowing the seeds. Ponderosa pine seedlings were grown in 160/90 styroblocks (160 cavities per block, 90 cm3 per cavity) at the University ofIdaho (UI) Forest Research Nursery during the 1996-growing season. The growing medium was a 50/50 percent peat-velmiculite mix (pH 4.2). A specific amount of controlled-release fertilizer was first fully mixed into the 50/50 percent peat-venniculite growing medium, and then container cells were hand filled with the mixture of growing medium and fertilizer. For the control treatment, no slow-release fertilizer was applied. Ponderosa pine seeds were sown with a vacuum seeder and covered with about 0.6 cm of Target Forestry Sand®. A completely randomized design with four replicates was used in this experiment since the environment where the seedlings were grown was homogeneous. Seedlings were grown in the regular nursery regime, in which seedlings also received regular nursery-based irrigation 5  and fertilization in addition to the controlled-release fe11ilizers. Thus, our control treatment is the regular nursery culture condition, which serves as the reference point in the vector analysis. Wenny and Dumroese (1987) delineated the growing environment for ponderosa pine in detail. They feel that seedlings grown in such an environn1ent, i.e. the controls in our experiment, suffer no nutrient stress.  Biomass harvest and tissue analysis  A random sample of thirty-two seedlings for each treatment was harvested for biomass measurement and tissue analysis at lifting (December 1, 1996). Each seedling was cut at the root collar, and the root was extracted from the cells and hand washed. The shoot was separated into foliage and stem. The foliage, stem and root samples were weighed after oven drying at 70 DC for 48 hours. Foliage and root samples were then ground and sent to the Scotts Company Laboratories in Allentown, PA for nutrient concentration analysis. The nutrients analyzed were N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn and Mo. Foliar nitrogen was determined using a standard mico-Kjeldahl procedure. Phosphorus, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn were detem1ined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission with digested plant tissue. Biomass and tissue concentration data were used in the graphical vector analysis.  Vector analysis  Graphical vector analysis has successfully been used to interpret plant nutrient status and nutrient shifts (dilution, deficiency, excess, etc) in response to silvicultural treatments (Weetman and Foumier 1982, Timmer and Miller 1991, lmo and Timmer 1992,1996, Weetman et a1.l993, Yobterick et a1.l994, Binkley et a1.l995). Timmer and Miller (1991) and Haase and Rose (1995) reviewed vector analysis comprehensively. Unlike other 6  approaches such as critical value approach (CVA), diagnosis and recommendation integrated system (DRIS) and compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND), vector analysis considers the change in both nutrient concentration and biomass, as well as nutrient content, the three parameters of plant response to nutrient supply simultaneously through the formula: c=aJm, where c, a, and m are nutrient concentration, content and dry mass, respectively (Timmer and Miller 1991). Based on the relative change (direction and magnitude) of the t1u-ee parameters, plant nutrient status can be diagnosed as growth dilution, steady state, deficiency, accumulation, toxic accumulation or antagonism (Figure 1). A control treatment or some early state ofthe same treatment can serve as the reference point for calculating and comparing the relative change of the three parameters for treatments of interest. In our study, the control treatment, theoretically free of nutrient stress, is the reference point for comparing the controlled release fertilizer effects on growth and nutrient status of ponderosa pine seedlings.  In the vector diagram, determination of the direction and magnitude (length) of each resultant vector depends on its component horizontal and vertical vector lengths (the means of the relative nutrient concentrations and contents) but does not consider potential variation in relative nutrient contents and concentrations. Conclusions may be incouect if the amount of variation in the vector is not considered. To address this issue, we expanded the vector interpretation of Figure 1 by considering the statistical significance of the component horizontal and vertical vectors. Dunnett's multiple-range tests were conducted for detecting the significance of nutrient concentrations and contents between the nine fertilization treatments and the control (Table 2). Two-way classification analysis of variance was performed to fmiher test the feliilizer type and dosage effects on both foliar and root nutrient 7  concentrations. The statistical computations were conducted using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure of SAS (SAS® Institute Inc. 1995).  The following results and discussion are based on interpretations described in Table 2. For simplicity and convenience, we use CTR to represent the control (no controlled release fertilizer added), and FR-0.8, FR-1.6, and FR-3.2 to represent the 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 grams per seedling of the FR fertilizer treatments. The moderate (MR) and slow (SR) treatments are similarly designated. We used an a level of 0.1 for all comparisons.  Results  No treatment produced a decrease in either foliage or root mass compared to the control (Table 3 and Figures 2 and 3), thus diagnoses oftoxic accumulation or antagonism did not occur in our study based on interpretations in Figure 1 and Table 2. Relative foliage mass increases ranged from 148% to 238%, while relative root mass increases ranged from 113% to 169% compared to the control (reference point). Treatment FR-0.8 produced the greatest relative increase for both foliage and root mass, 238% and 169% respectively, among all treatments tested in our study. Content (concentration x mass) increased for most nutrients and treatments, although many contents were not statistically different from the controls, indicating increased nutrient uptake for the fertilized seedlings (Table 3).  All three rates of FR fertilizer produced relatively few statistically significant changes in either foliage or root nutrient concentrations (Table 4 and Figure 2a and 2b; and Figure 3a and 3b) indicating ""steady-state"" nutrition. Such a vector occurs when mass (foliage or root) and nutrient content increase (mass and content are provided in Table 3) while nutrient concentration remains unchanged (a 'B' vector in Figure 1). In contrast, 8  treatments MR-3.2 and SR-3.2 produced a number of significant changes in nutrient concentrations (Table 4 and Figure 2c through 2f; and Figure 3c through 3f) indicating either deficiency or dilution vectors.  Discussion  Since the control treatment is theoretically free ofnutrient stress (Wenny and Dumroese 1987), controlled release fertilizer treatments that maintain ""steady-state"" nutrition while increasing seedling mass are highly desirable in our study. Treatment FR-O. 8 produced the largest increase in foliage mass (238%) and root mass (169%) of all treatments while maintaining all nutrients, except foliage Mo, at ""steady-state"" (Figure 2a and 2b and Figure 3a and 3b). The ""steady-state"" vectors resulting from treatment FR-O.8 indicate that nutrients were supplied in sufficient amounts to support the higher growth rates and increased biomass accumulation compared to the controls since nutrient contents increased in proportion to biomass. Perhaps fonnulation ofthe controlled-release fertilizer could be modified to include more Mo in the blend. Alternatively, Mo amounts could be increased in the nursery-based ""fertilization"" regime. The much larger seedlings produced by the FR-O.8 treatment also had an acceptable shoot/root ratio of about 3 (Fan 1999).  The MR-3.2 treatment produced the second largest increase in both foliage and root mass, 214% and 149% respectively (Figure 2c and 2d; and Figure 3c and 3d). However, most ofthe nutrients did 110t show ""steady-state"" behavior; rather, many deficiency vectors were produced by the :Y1R-3.2 treatment. Finally, the application rate ofthe MR-3.2 treatment is four times higher than for FR-O.8, yet the seedlings were somewhat smaller. Clearly FR-O.8 is a superior treatment, likely because the fast nutrient release early in the 9  growth cycle closely matches seedling nutrient requirements to support rapid growth and increased biomass accumulation. Additionally, the low (0.8 gm) dosage allows sufficient room for root expansion. With the higher application rates tested in our study, fertilizer granules occupied substantial volume in these small ""160/90"" containers during a large part of the growing season, particularly for the slow release products.  We did not include economic or nursery operational considerations in our study. Our intent was to demonstrate the use of graphical vector analysis, modified with statistical comparisons of the vector components, to design nutrition regimes combining inigation water fertilizers with controlled-release fertilizers in the root plug to obtain a desirable biological outcome. Nursery mangers can conduct tests similar to ours with controlled­release fertilizers combined with their existing nutrient regime. Then, using the vector analysis approach employed in our study, they could select the best regime for their particular nursery economic and operational conditions.  Conclusions  Compared to the control, treatment FR-0.8 produced the largest increase in foliage mass (238%) and root mass (169%) of all treatments while maintaining all nutrients, except foliage Mo, at a desirable ""steady-state"" condition. Some slow release fertilizers applied at higher rates, when combined with the existing nursery fertilization schedules, produced seedlings with poor nutritional balance in both foliage and roots. These treatments were readily detected with nutrient vector analysis. Our study demonstrates the use of graphical vector analysis to design container nursery nutrient regimes. 10  Acknowledgments: The authors thank the Scott's Company and other members ofthe  Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative for their support.

Management of Ponderosa Pine Nutrition Through Fertilization,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Shaw, T.M.; Mika, P.G.; Johnson, L.R.","The results of a series of replicated fertilization trials established throughout the Inland Northwest were reviewed for information specific to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. and C. Lawson) nutrition. Ponderosa pine nitrogen (N) status was often better than the N-status of other Inland Northwest species, and therefore growth response to N fertilization was often lower than that of other species. Fertilization of ponderosa pine with N alone sometimes appeared to cause increased tree susceptibility to mortality by insect, disease and perhaps abiotic stresses. Growth and mortality response to N fertilization appeared to be related to foliage potassium (K)/N ratio in some cases. The application of K and micronutrients in combination with N may have protected the trees from N-related mortality while stimulating a growth response. Sulfur fertilization was not found to evoke a growth response in ponderosa pine, and may have increased mortality rates slightly. On certain rock types and vegetation series, ponderosa pine showed high growth response to macronutrient plus micronutrient fertilization as well as herbicide treatment. Ponderosa pine generally did not show a strong growth response to N fertilization, except on �good� rock types on moist sites. Multinutrient (macro- plus micronutrient) fertilization combined with an herbicide treatment often provided a better response than N alone on moderate to dry sites and/or �bad� rock types. Other species in mixed-conifer stands, particularly grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), often showed a better growth response to fertilization than ponderosa pine. The nutritional ecology of ponderosa pine is unique among Inland forest tree species and should be considered when evaluating nutrient management options.",2005-01-01,yes,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Garrison-Johnston, Mariann, Terry Shaw, Peter Mika and Leonard R.

Fate of Applied Sulfate in Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils,"Kimsey, Jr., M.; McDaniel, P.; Strawn, D.; Moore, J.","Forests in the Inland Northwest, USA, commonly show SO4 defi-ciency, suggesting limited SO4 availability in the soils. Regional soils, which lie between the east slopes of the northern Cascade Range and the west slopes of the northern Rocky Mountains, are influenced to varying degrees by poorly crystalline aluminosilicates and ferrihydrite, and are often classified as Andisols (Andosols). Research has shown that SO4 retention is greatly influenced by Fe and Al oxides. However, little is known of the sorption behavior exhibited by poorly crystalline andic soils of the region. In this study we investigated the mineralogy and SO4 sorption capacity of ash-influenced soils found in the Inland Northwest.

PROJECT OVERVIEW  The current collection and dissemination ofESI forest plot information regarding Psuedotsuga menziesii var. glauca in north Idaho relies entirely on a method developed by P.  H. Cochran. The incorporation ofthe Cochran method was introduced to NRCS Idaho from NRCS Oregon with Technical Note 190-VI.  Development of yield and site index curves by Cochran was based entirely on forest stands  located on the eastslopes ofthe Cascade Range and Blue Mountains ofeastern Oregon/  southeast Washington. Cochran's proposed site index and yield curves were well developed  and suited for the forested landscapes used in his modeling efforts.  However, forest stands ofnorth Idaho and northwestern Montana are often dissimilar to their counterparts ofthe Cascades and Blue Mountains. This dissimilarity will inherently create significant predicted site index and yield error when using the Cochran method in north Idaho. Furthermore, there were very few Cochran research plots established on cedarlhemlock habitat types. Consequently, volume and site index estimates generated by the Cochran method will not reflect north Idaho productivity on these more climax habitat types.  Several USDA-USFS research projects specifically developed site index and yield curves for north Idaho. Research papers INT-347 (R.A. Monserud, 1985) and INT-394 (A. Stage et aI., 1988) address these topics. Forest stands used to develop these models were located north from Grangeville to Porthill, Idaho and east to Libby, Montana.  Most private and state forest management entities ofnorth Idaho utilize the Stage and Monserud models for reporting yield and site index. This creates a communication breakdown between the NRCS and other forest management entities. Standardization of yield and site index reports by the NRCS is needed not only to prevent this from occurring, but also to improve rotation estimates, carbon sequestration estimates, and other natural resource interpretations. Bringing the data up to consistent and accurate standards would improve the usability and acceptance of the NRCS Idaho soil survey product.  1.2 OBJECTIVES  The objectives ofthis project were fourfold:  1) correlate Cochran site index values with Monserud to obtain a conversion algorithm,  2) develop predictive yield curves and algorithms suitable for north Idaho,  3) derive mean annual increment curves, and  4) create culmination ofmean annual increment tables.  .. 4  1.3 METHODS  1.3.1 Site Index Conversion  Site index calculations for inland Northwest Douglas-fir utilize the Monserud equation as  given in Appendix 1. The equation is as follows:  S = [38.787 -2.805 *(lnAi + 0.0216 * A * InA  +  (0.4948 * Zj + 0.4305 * Z2 + 0.3964 * Z3) * H  +  (25.315 * Zj + 28.415 * Z2 + 30.008 * Z3 * H / A];  where,  Zj = 1 ifhabitat type is in the DF series, or ootherwise;  Z2 = 1 ifhabitat type is in the GF or WRC series, or 1 ifhave no habitat type infonnation; ootherwise;  Z3 = 1 ifhabitat type is in the WH or SAP series, or  ootherwise. H = total height -4.5'. S = site index -4.5'. A = age at breast height.  luX= the natural logarithm ofargument X.  A Cochran to Monserud conversion calculation was created using raw data from local ESI data fonns. Tree growth data and habitat type were entered into a spreadsheet, from which Monserud site index values were calculated using the above equation. A least-squares regression fit was applied to the estimated Monserud and Cochran site index values. A simple, linear regression fonnula was detennined and is as follows:  Monserud Site Index = 0.9557 * Cochran Site Index -5.6644  1.3.2 Yield Curves  Data from Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 2 were used as the base data for creating yield curves for two differing scenarios. Scenario one addresses volume yield based on total stand volume for naturally regenerated, unmanaged Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western white pine. Scenario two addresses volume yield based on Douglas-fir growth only in an unmanaged plantationwithinitialstockingdensity of500trees/ac. Bothsets ofdatawereanalyzedby the PROC NLIN procedure in SAS 8.1®. A modified Richard's growth equation was used in conjunction with an iterative SAS Newton method to obtain predicted non-linear volume curves. The developed equation is as follows: 5  where,  a, & a2 = linear slope and intercept values of an estimated volume  asymptote,  S=site index (total height -4.5'),  A = breast height age,  -k = growth rate function,  m, & m2 = linear slope and intercept values for the biological system  exponent, and  to = 6; estimated base age at which volume begins to  accumulate.  Base data for site index values 60 and 70 in Table 1 were not included during model  development. These data created anomalies during the model process and did not allow the  equation to converge. Original data is suspect; therefore, curves were fit exclusive ofthese  data.  Table 2 in Appendix 2 only presents base volume data for site index values of 50, 70, and 90. Consequently, only predicted curves are shown for site indexes of40, 60, 80, and 100.  A linear fit equation was created for volume asymptote and biological exponent data using the cubic foot volume data from Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 2. This allowed for the calculation ofa volume yield estimate at a site index value outside the decadal increments given in these tables.  1.3.3 Current Mean Annual Increment Curves  Mean annual increment curves were created using both the base data and modeled data to determine the point ofculmination. Mean annual increment was calculated using the following formula:  MAl = Total volume / Breast Height Age  Culmination ofMAl occurs at that breast height age where incremental volume is maximized. 6  1.4 RESULTS  1.4.1 Site Index Conversion  Figure 1 depicts site index trends dependent on formula method and habitat type. Climax habitat types such as western red cedar and western hemlock show the greatest discrepancy between the two alternative site index calculations. These differences are significant at a =  0.1. This wide variation is primarily attributable to the lack ofTHPL and TSHE site plots in the Cochran study. The declining trend in site index values shown in the climax habitat types can also be observed in more seral habitat type phases. However, these differences are not significantly different at any desirable a level. It could be stated that the differences in site index at the drier range in data is well within the measurement error, thus any differences in site index values are not entirely applicable to a change in calculation method.  90 80 70 60  -50=­&gt;&lt;  Q)  ""C  40  c J!l  (j) 30 20 10  0 -10 -Cochran 51 fif"",,!';;:&gt;;l Monserud 51 _ 81 Difference  fj­"",  • I  I  P5ME ABGR THPL T5HE  Figure 1.

Figure 3 shows a wide discrepancy between predicted and base data for site index values of  60 and 70. The potential answer to this wide difference may be in the base data. Research  scientists near the INT-394 project state that there were potential anomalies in the data  collected for those site indexes. Therefore, this data was removed during model creation.  Volume estimates within these site index values should not be construed as widely inaccurate, as all other data was used to build the equation.  No such discrepancies existed for the Douglas-fir plantation data. The only limitation during modeldevelopmentforthisset ofdatawasinthelimit ofsiteindexvalueslisted. Dataonly existed for site index values of 50, 70, and 90. Therefore, estimated volume curves as shown in Figure 4, have no observed corollary for site index values of40, 60, 80, and 100. However, the curves generated for 50, 70, and 90 show extremely tight fits to the original base data, thus the curves for 40, 60, 80, and 100 can be assumed as acceptable estimates. ---  -------------  -----------  -------  -------  -------  ••  •  •  •  •  •  10  1.4.3 Current Mean Annual Increment Curves  Mean annual increment curves for naturally regenerated and plantation forests were generated using both predicted and base data (Figures 5 and 6).

Base data is derived from DF plantations with initial stocking densities  of500 trees/ac.  1.4.4 Current Mean Annual Increment Tables  Using the modified Richard's growth equation as presented in 1.3.2, a matrix ofCMAI values were created for both management regimes (Tables I and 2). Predicted CMAI values are presented in both annual cubic feet per acre and annual cubic meters per hectare. Metric values are simple conversions from the English units. The metric conversion used is as follows:  M3 = Fe * 0.02831685  These tables indicate that naturally regenerated stands on poorer quality sites take longer to accumulate less biomass than their plantation counterparts. At higher quality sites, naturally regenerated stands can sustain a larger tree biomass than pure Douglas-fir plantations; however, it may take an additional 40 years to achieve this increase. These differences are attributable to the higher volume production during the early and middle ages ofplantation establislnnent because height growth is fastest at the early ages. 12  Cochran CMAI tables (Technical Note 19D-VI) exhibit significant differences to those CMAI tables generated using Idaho and Montana data. Culmination age is significantly different between Cochran and regional data. Cochran underestimates CMAI when compared with regional, naturally regenerated, unmanaged forest stands and overestimates when compared with regional, unmanaged Douglas-fir plantations.  Culmination volume as generated by Cochran tends to underestimate the volume attainable on regional forestlands regardless ofsite quality. This volume reduction could be partially attributable to the lack ofclimax habitat types in Cochran's study. As stated in the site index discussion, the sites used in Cochran's study were drier and tended toward the seral habitat types. Consequently, his model would fail to account for increased productivity on the wetter climax habitat types. 13  Table 1.

PROJECT OVERVIEW  The collection and dissemination of ESI forest plot information regarding Psuedotsuga menziesii var. glauca in north Idaho relies entirely on a method developed by P. H. Cochran. The incorporation of the Cochran method was introduced to NRCS Idaho from NRCS Oregon with Technical Note 190-VI.  Development of yield and site index curves by Cochran was based entirely on forest stands located on the east slopes of the Cascade Range and Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon / southeast Washington. Cochran’s proposed site index and yield curves were well developed and suited for the forested landscapes used in his modeling efforts.  However, forest stands of north Idaho and northwestern Montana are often dissimilar to their counterparts of the Cascades and Blue Mountains. This dissimilarity will inherently create significant predicted site index and yield error when using the Cochran method in north Idaho.  Several USDA-USFS research projects specifically developed site index and yield curves for north Idaho. Research papers INT-347 (R.A. Monserud, 1985) and INT-394 (A. Stage et al., 1988) address these topics. Forest stands used to develop these models were located north from Grangeville to Porthill, Idaho and east to Libby, Montana.  Most private and state forest management entities of north Idaho utilize the Stage and Monserud models for reporting yield and site index. This creates a communication breakdown between the NRCS and other forest management entities. Standardization of yield and site index reports by the NRCS is needed not only to prevent this from occurring, but also to improve rotation estimates, carbon sequestration estimates, and other naturals resource interpretations. Bringing the data up to consistent and accurate standards would improve the usability and acceptance of the NRCS Idaho soil survey product.  1.2 OBJECTIVES  The objectives of this project were fourfold:  1) Correlate Cochran site index values with Monserud to obtain a conversion algorithm,  2) Develop predictive yield curves and algorithms suitable for north Idaho,  3) Derive mean annual increment curves, and  4) Create culmination of mean annual increment tables.4  1.3 METHODS  1.3.1 Site Index Conversion  Site index calculations for inland Northwest Douglas-fir utilize the Monserud equation as given in Appendix 1. The equation is as follows:  Site Index = [38.787 – 2.805 * (lnA)2 + 0.0216 * A * lnA  + (0.4948 * Z1 + 0.4305 * Z2 + 0.3964 * Z3) * H  + (25.315 * Z1 + 28.415 * Z2 + 30.008 * Z3 * H / A];  where,  Z1 = 1 if habitat type is in the DF series, or  0 otherwise;  Z2 = 1 if habitat type is in the GF or WRC series, or  1 if have no habitat type information;  0 otherwise;  Z3 = 1 if habitat type is in the WH or SAF series, or  0 otherwise.  H = total height – 4.5’.  S = site index – 4.5’.  A = age at breast height.  lnx = the natural logarithm of argument x.  A Cochran to Monserud conversion calculation was created using raw data from local ESI data forms. Tree growth data and habitat type was entered into a spreadsheet, from which Monserud site index values were calculated using the above equation. A least-squares regression fit was applied to the estimated Monserud and Cochran site index values. A simple, linear regression formula was determined and is as follows:  Monserud Site Index = 0.9557 * Cochran Site Index – 5.6644  1.3.2 Yield Curves  Data from Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 2 were used as the base data for creating yield curves for two differing scenarios. Scenario one addresses volume yield based on total stand volume. This data will contain volume data for the naturally regenerated, unmanaged tree species Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western white pine. Scenario two addresses volume yield based on Douglas-fir growth only in an unmanaged plantation with initial stocking density of 500 trees/ac. Both sets of data were analyzed by the PROC NLIN procedure in SAS 8.1®. A modified Richard’s growth equation was used in conjunction with an iterative SAS Newton method to obtain predicted non-linear volume curves. The developed equation is as follows:5  Volume = ((a2*SI)-a1)*(1-exp(-k*(AGE-t0)))^(1/(1-((m2*SI)+m1)));  where,  a1 & a2 = linear slope and intercept values of an estimated volume  asymptote,  SI = site index (total height – 4.5’)  AGE = total age at 4.5’  -k = growth rate function,  m1 & m2 = linear slope and intercept values for the biological system  exponent, and  t0 = 6; estimated base age at which volume begins to  accumulate.  Base data for site index values 60 and 70 in Table 1 were not included during model development. These data created anomalies during the model process and did not allow the equation to converge. Original data is suspect; therefore, curves were fit exclusive of these data.  Table 2 in Appendix 2 only presents base volume data for site index values of 50, 70, and 90. Consequently, only predicted curves are shown for site indexes of 40, 60, 80, and 100.  A linear fit equation was created for asymptote and biological exponent data using the data from Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 2. This allowed for the calculation of a volume yield estimate at a site index value outside the decadal increments given in these tables.  1.3.3 Current Mean Annual Increment Curves  Mean annual increment curves were created using both the base data and modeled data to determine the point of culmination. Mean annual increment was calculated using the following formula:  MAI = Total volume / Total Age  Culmination of MAI occurs at that total tree age where incremental volume is maximized. 6  1.4 RESULTS  1.4.1 Site Index Conversion  Figure 1 depicts site index trends dependent on formula method and habitat type. Climax habitat types such as western red cedar and western hemlock show the greatest discrepancy between the two alternative site index calculations. These differences are significant at α = 0.1. The declining trend in site index values shown in the climax habitat types can also be observed in more seral habitat type phases. However, these differences are not significantly different at any desirable α level. It could be stated that the differences in site index at the drier range in data is well within the measurement error, thus any differences in site index values are not entirely applicable to a change in calculation method.

Figure 3 shows a wide discrepancy between predicted and base data for site index values of 60 and 70. The potential answer to this wide difference may be in the base data. Sources near the project involved in the INT-394 project state that there was potential anomalies in the data collected for those site indexes. Therefore, this data was removed during model creation. Volume estimates within these site index values should not be construed as widely inaccurate, as all other data was used to build the equation.  No such discrepancies existed for the Douglas-fir plantation data. The only limitation during model development for this set of data was in the limit of site index values listed. Data only existed for site index values of 50, 70, and 90. Therefore, estimated volume curves as shown in Figure 4, have no observed corollary for site index values of 40, 60, 80, and 100. However, the curves generated for 50, 70, and 90 show extremely tight fits to the original base data, thus the curves for 40, 60, 80, and 100 can be assumed as acceptable estimates.10  1.4.3 Current Mean Annual Increment Curves  Mean annual increment curves for naturally regenerated and plantation forests were generated using both predicted and base data (Figures 5 and 6). Predicted MAI curves show a trend of underestimating culmination of mean annual increment (CMAI) at high site index values and overestimating at lower site index values in naturally regenerated stands. For Douglas-fir plantations, there is little discrepancy between predicted MAI and base data MAI, thus CMAI is nearly equivalent in both age and yield estimates.

Base data is derived from DF plantations with initial stocking densities  of 500 trees/ac.  1.4.4 Current Mean Annual Increment Tables  Using the modified Richard’s growth equation as presented in 1.3.2, a matrix of CMAI values were created for both management regimes (Tables 1 and 2). Predicted CMAI values are presented in both annual cubic feet per acre and annual cubic meters per hectare.  These tables indicate that naturally regenerated stands on poorer quality sites take longer to accumulate less biomass than their plantation counterparts. At higher quality sites, naturally regenerated stands can sustain a larger tree biomass than pure Douglas-fir plantations; however, it may take an additional 40 years to achieve this increase. These differences are attributable to the higher volume production during the early and middle ages of plantation establishment because height growth is fastest at the early ages.  Cochran CMAI tables (Technical Note 190-VI) exhibit significant differences to those CMAI tables generated using Idaho and Montana data. A comparison of Cochran CMAI tables with 12  those generated with regional forest stands show that the Cochran method tends to underestimate the volume attainable on regional forestlands regardless of site quality. Age at which a stand reaches CMAI shows two different trends between Cochran and regional data. Cochran predicts a younger age for CMAI when compared with a regional, naturally regenerated, unmanaged stand. However, Cochran overestimates age of CMAI when compared with a regional, unmanaged Douglas-fir plantation, with region.13  Table 1.

Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical  Properties of Ash-Cap Soils  Leonard R. Johnson, Debbie Page-Dumroese and Han-Sup Han  Introduction  General Process of Compaction  Compaction of soils is created through the energy exerted on the soil, usually through vehicular  traffic in harvesting and site preparation operations. It results in the reduction of air spaces in  the soil with a corresponding increase in the bulk density of the soil (weight per unit of volume).  Erosion can also result from forest operations. Erosion generally occurs as a result of soil displace-ment  and is most often associated with harvest and site preparation activities on steeper slopes.  Although generally viewed in a negative context with respect to forest soils, compaction is often  a desirable process in construction activities. Many engineering projects involving earthwork in  earthen dams, structural foundations, and roads require predictable strength in the soils that are at  70 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils  the foundation of the construction projects. Various compaction methods have  been developed to achieve a desired level of soil strength and density. Some of  the principles derived from research in civil engineering and soil mechanics on  achieving desired levels of compaction can also be applied to forest soils in de-termining  conditions where natural soils are at the greatest risk of compaction.  Cullen and Montagne (1981) conducted an extensive summary of literature on  the general relationships between soil properties and compaction. Their review  includes the general relationship between the soil properties of texture, fragment  content, structure, moisture content at the time of compaction, and organic matter  and the susceptibility of the soil to compaction. A more recent review by Miller  and others (2004) summarized current literature on the effects of heavy equip-ment  on soils and productivity. The discussion in this section draws heavily on  these literature reviews.  Engineering Compaction Methods  Compression or kneading compaction is generally achieved in the field with  equipment that exerts gradually increasing pressure on the soil. Pressure is gradu-ally  increased to a maximum and then is gradually decreased. A device commonly  used to accomplish this task in construction is called a sheepsfoot roller. Rubber  tired rollers also exhibit the characteristics of this kneading action. The interaction  of the tires of rubber-tired skidders used in forest operations with the soil seems  to resemble that of kneading compaction machines, but with far less pressure  than the equipment designed for that purpose.  Vibratory compactors usually combine pressure on the soil with vibration.  Hand-held models utilize a vibrating plate. Larger versions combine a large steel  roller with a vibratory impulse. There is some conjecture that tracked equipment  used in forest operations can duplicate this action, but, again, with far less com-pactive  energy than equipment designed for that purpose.  Engineering properties of soils are important to compaction. In addition to  moisture content, important factors include initial soil strength or bulk density,  distribution of particle sizes, percent organic matter, rock-fragment content, and  percent sand, silt or clay (soil texture). The presence and influence of clay in the  soil will usually determine whether it is classified as cohesive or non-cohesive. Clay  influences the susceptibility of soils to compaction because of the small particle  sizes of clay, clay mineralogy, and through its effect on shear strength. With small  clay particles, the shear strength on soils can be partially attributed to the chemical  bonding and electro-chemical resistance between particles (Brown 1977).  Soil type, texture and structure will influence the equipment that is most ef-fective  in achieving the highest level of compaction. Means and Parcher (1963)  found that “maximum densities for soils with coarse texture were achieved with  a heavy smooth-wheeled roller with some vibratory effects.” Coarse textured  soils, usually those very low in clay content, are non-cohesive and these generally  require vibratory compactors. Fine-textured soils and soils with a high content of  clay are usually not compacted well through vibratory compactors and require  the kneading action of a mechanism similar to a sheepsfoot roller (Ingersoll-Rand  1975). Kryine (1951) noted that, in general, the maximum soil densities achieved  by several methods of laboratory and field compaction decrease with decreasing  soil particle size. The highest densities generally occur in soils with a wide range  in particle sizes where particles can be reoriented in ways that allow the small  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007 71  Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han  particles to pack into the voids between the larger particles (Li 1956; Cullen and  Montagne 1981; Miller and others 2004).  Ash-cap soils have unique characteristics that affect their response to the various  compaction methods. While the particle size is relatively small, ash-cap soils are  also considered non-cohesive and non-plastic (Cullen and others 1991). Because  of their non-cohesive nature, they are likely to be susceptible to vibratory com-paction  (Cullen and Montagne 1981). While the kneading action of a sheepsfoot  roller would probably exceed the shear strength of ash-cap soils and would not be  effective for compaction, the pressure and more subtle kneading action produced  by rubber-tired and tracked vehicles could increase bulk densities.  Froehlich and others (1980) completed a general report for the Equipment  Development Center of the U.S. Forest Service to provide a basis for predicting  soil compaction on forested land. Observed soil types included sandy loam, clay  loam and loam. The study developed equations to predict absolute and percent  changes in bulk density with vehicular traffic. While specific values associated  with the equations may not be useful in a broad sense, the statistically significant  factors are of interest. These include the number of trips by equipment, initial soil  strength (cone index), initial soil density, machine derived pressure of the vehicle  in kilograms per square centimeter, soil organic matter in percent, soil moisture  content in percent, and forest floor depth. The most significant of these factors  were number of trips and the initial cone index of the soil, reflecting a measure  of initial soil strength and the level of machine activity as two primary factors in  determining changes in soil characteristics.  Optimum Moisture Content  The optimum moisture content for compaction is related to the energy generated  in the compaction effort. As compaction effort increases, soils will be compacted  to higher soil strength and bulk density. The maximum bulk density will also occur  at lower optimum moisture content. Soils below the optimum moisture content  will not be compacted to as high a bulk density as when they are at the optimum  moisture content (Håkansson and Lipiec 2000). Up to and including the optimum  moisture content, water can lubricate particles and allow their reorientation with  respect to each other. Most compaction is seen in wet conditions, particularly  near soil field moisture capacity (Alexander and Poff 1985). When soil moisture  exceeds the optimum moisture content of the soil, soils begin to become plastic  or the incompressibility of the water prevents reorientation and packing of the  soil particles. According to the review by Cullen and Montagne (1981), optimum  moisture content for compaction tends to increase as soil texture becomes finer  (Felt 1965). The less dense the initial soil sample, the greater the moisture con-tent  required to reach maximum soil density for a given compactive effort (Lull  1959).  Optimum moisture content for compaction is determined for engineering  purposes by a laboratory analysis called the Proctor test. The standard proctor  test involves 25 blows of a 2.5 kg hammer dropped from a height of 30.5 cm.  Because this test did not generate sufficient energy to predict compaction efforts  of most modern construction equipment, a modified proctor test was developed.  The modified test increased the compaction energy, using 25 blows of a 4.5 kg  hammer dropped from a height of 45.7 cm. Both the standard and modified Proc-tor  tests created too much compaction energy to effectively predict compaction  72 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils  from equipment used in forest operations (Froehlich and others 1980). A light  proctor test using 8% of the energy of the standard Proctor test appeared to be  effective in predicting the compaction effort of harvesting and site preparation  equipment. It involved 10 blows of a hammer weighing 0.5 kg dropped from a  height of 30.5 cm. The general relationship between optimum moisture content,  maximum bulk density and level of compaction effort are illustrated in Figure 1.  As compaction energy increases, the optimum moisture content for compaction  decreases.  Soil texture can also affect the response of the soil to compaction efforts and  its sensitivity to moisture content. Figure 2 illustrates theoretical differences in  maximum bulk density and sensitivity to moisture for well graded and uniform  soils when other factors of the soil are held constant. Although the light Proctor  test could be used to predict maximum bulk densities that might result from forest  operations for some soil types, it also showed that the soils were less sensitive  to moisture content when there was less compaction energy applied. The com-paction  curve was flatter and, in some cases, U-shaped as illustrated in Figure 3  (Froehlich and others 1980).  Davis (1992) used the light Proctor test in his studies of bulk density changes  in two central Oregon soils. He found the light proctor test to be adequate for  describing a cobbly loam soil, but found a test using the heavier hammer of the  standard proctor test with 5 to10 blows of the hammer (rather than 25) to be more  accurate in predicting compaction for the ash-cap soil with sandy loam texture.  His Proctor tests showed gradually increasing bulk densities as compaction effort  increased, but there was not a high sensitivity to soil moisture content.  Total organic matter content in the soil is closely related to aggregate size and  stability. Thus a reduction in organic matter content will result in a loss of ag-gregate  stability and a subsequent increase in a soil’s potential for compaction  (Alderfer and Merkle 1941). Working with four soils in New York, Free and others  (1947) concluded that soil samples containing the most organic matter would be  compacted the least at given moisture contents and compactive efforts. This re-lationship  between organic matter and compactibility of soils was also confirmed  in the review conducted by Miller and others (2004).

Two of the most common include: (1) the bulk density of the soil  and (2) soil strength as often measured by the resistance of the soil to penetration  with a calibrated penetrometer. While measurement of bulk density or soil strength  before and after vehicular traffic is ideal because it reduces sampling error, it is sel-dom  done. Most often the measurements are taken “on and off” compacted areas.  If the soil disturbance has also displaced soils in compacted areas, this leads to the  risk of comparing soil characteristics in one soil horizon with those in another.

Bulk density and rock content  measurements are required to convert soil nutrient, water, and microbial measures  to a mass-per-area basis to compare between sites with different bulk densities  and within-site processes (McNabb and others 1986). Although rocks are often  not a large component of ash-cap soils, roots and steep slopes make it extremely  difficult to accurately determine soil bulk density. A number of different meth-ods  have been used to determine bulk density in soils. These can generally be  categorized as (1) core sampling, (2) excavation and volume displacement and  (3) radiation.  Core sampling is a simple, straightforward method for measuring bulk density.  Cylinders of a known volume are driven into the soil and the resultant soil core  dried and weighed. In some cases, narrow and small core samplers may over-estimate  bulk density by compacting soil into the cylinder when it is hammered  into the soil.  Volume excavation is an appealing alternative to core techniques because it  allows for flexibility in volume of soil sampled based on the size of soil coarse-fragments,  roots or hardpans. A hole is excavated to the desired depth and width,  all soil material is removed and collected for weight determination and the vol-ume  of the hole measured. Various methods have been used to measure hole  volume including known quantities of sand or styrofoam balls, water as measured  in a plastic bag lining the hole (Kohl 1988), and expanding polyurethane foam  (Page‑Dumroese and others 1999).  Radiation methods are instantaneous, produce minimal soil disturbance, allow  accessibility to subsoil measurements without excavation, do not have to be on  a level site, and have the option of continuous or repeated measurements of the  same point (Blake and Hartge 1986). With a nuclear moisture-density gauge, the  source probe is lowered to selected soil depths through access tubes and the  average density between the source and surface-located detector is obtained.  However, using a nuclear gauge is not common on forest sites far from a road  since it weighs about 18 kg. In addition, the equipment operator much be certified  to handle and transport radioactive material (Flint and Childs 1984).  Penetrometer  Soil penetrability is a measure of the ease with which a probe can be pushed  or driven into the soil (Vaz and others 2001). The resistance to penetration is re-lated  to the pressure required to form a spherical cavity in the soil, large enough  to accommodate the cone of the penetrometer, and allowing for the frictional  resistance between the cone and its surrounding soil. Ease of penetration by the  probe is influenced by both soil and probe characteristics. Soil-to-probe friction  is governed by probe factors such as cone angle, diameter, roughness and rate of  penetration. Soil factors influencing penetration resistance are matric water po-tential  (water content), bulk density, soil compressibility, soil texture, and organic  matter content (Smith and others 1997; Vaz and others 2001).  Major factors that limit the use and interpretation of penetrometers as field indi-cators  of excessive compaction are the influences of water content and initial bulk  density, mostly because there is an insufficient data base to allow adjustments for  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007 75  Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han  these factors (Gupta and Allmara 1987; Bennie and Burger 1988). A widely accepted  method is to measure penetrometer resistance at or near field moisture capacity.  Penetrometer-measured soil strength has been principally linked with soil bulk  density, water content, clay content, and organic carbon. Usually soil strength  increases with increasing bulk density and decreasing water content, except at  lower levels of compaction when soil strength declines as soils dry out (Smith  and others 1997). Since soil strength is strongly related to water content, it varies  considerably throughout the year with each wetting and drying cycle (Busscher  and others 1997). This relationship is also influenced by the degree of compac-tion  (Mirreh and Ketcheson 1972). Increasing clay contents appears to reduce the  rate at which soil strength increases as soils dry to wilting point. With increasing  organic matter content, soil strength values are high at field capacity, especially  at higher bulk densities (Smith and others 1997).  Correlation between methods of measuring compaction  Increases in bulk density generally have a positive correlation to increases in the  resistance to penetration as measured by a penetrometer, but specific, statistical  relationships between these two types of measurement have been much more  ­difficult  to establish. Efforts to correlate bulk density measurements to penetrometer  readings through regression analysis have often failed or resulted in an extremely  low correlation coefficient (Landsberg and others 2003; Froese 2004). Allbrook  (1986) was reasonably successful in developing a statistical relationship between  bulk density and soil strength (R2=0.67) when the soil strength was measured at  or near field capacity moisture content. The study was conducted on volcanic  soils in central Oregon and compared bulk densities and soil strength in skid ruts  and in adjacent undisturbed areas. Soils had initial soil bulk densities averaging  0.80 Mg/m3. At the 5 cm depth he found a 23.2% increase in bulk densities mea-sured  with a nuclear densimeter and a 143% increase in soil strength as measured  with a penetrometer. It appears that the soil strength measurements were more  sensitive and responsive to changes in soil conditions, but it is also clear that a  standard of detrimental soil disturbance that dictates less than a 15% change in  bulk density will not be the appropriate percentage standard when comparing  soil strength (penetrometer) readings. The USDA Forest Service uses a threshold  value of a 15% increase in bulk density for determining when soil compaction  has reached a level that is detrimental to biomass production (Powers and ­others  1998).  Characterization of Ash-Cap Soils__________________________________  Soils characterized as ash-cap soils are often derived from a variety of volcanic  eruptions, the most common being the eruption of Mount Mazama at Crater Lake,  Oregon. These soils are often considered surficial deposits, overlaying the soil  derived from the base rock by depths that vary from 15 cm to several meters. They  are frequently characterized in the silt loam or sandy loam textural categories of  soils. Most ash-cap soils are characterized by low bulk densities, generally less  than 0.75 g/cm3, and by high porosity and low shear strength (Page-Dumroese  1993; Cullen and Montagne 1981; Davis 1992). The predominance of silica (glass  fragments) in the soil contributes to the water holding capacity of the soil. The  distribution of micro- and macro-pore spaces provides many areas for holding  76 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils  water, especially in the micro- pore spaces. One effect of compaction may be  to decrease the macro-pore space that is easily assessable to plants, but not the  micro-pore space. Ash-cap soils can also be characterized by relatively low clay  content. This generally means that there will be very little cohesion and internal  bonding in the soil. Without clay, there will be very little shrinking and swelling  and this may affect the rate of soil recovery from compaction.  Although ash-cap influenced soils are non-cohesive, they do not seem to recover  easily from compaction. Froehlich and others (1985) observed compaction on  and off skid trails on several harvested sites in central Idaho. For soils of volcanic  origin, there was a reduction in the percent difference in density on and off trails  with time, but they also found that soil bulk density on volcanic soils were still  26% higher at 15 cm depth in the trails than off trails 20-25 years after harvest-ing.  One risk with soil recovery studies that consider bulk densities in disturbed  and undisturbed areas is that they may not be comparing the same soil types  and texture. For example, if the disturbance also displaced soil on a skid trail, the  comparison may be between the surface horizon of the undisturbed soil and a  sub-horizon of the soil on the skid trail.  There are several hypotheses on why ash-cap soils do not recover more quickly.  One is that the compaction activity breaks down the soil particles and/or realigns  them into more of a platy structure that allows them to fit closer together after  traffic. Another is that the jagged edges of the silica dominated ash-cap soil par-ticles  are physically locked during compaction. Since clay content is low, there  is little natural shrinkage and swelling in the soil. Other factors may be related  to the high initial percent change in bulk density that generally occurs and the  lack of a significant freeze-thaw cycles in the drier regions of the intermountain  western USA.  Cullen and others (1991) characterized two ash-cap soils in their work in  western Montana. Using a standard Proctor test they determined the optimum  moisture content for compaction of ash cap soils to be about 228 g/kg (22.8%)  and 256 g/kg (25.6%) in the surface layer with a projected maximum bulk density  at this moisture content of 1.50 Mg/m3 and 1.36 Mg/m3 for ash over quartzite or  limestone till, respectively. These bulk densities are much higher than those en-countered  in even heavily compacted forest soils as a result of forest operations.  Given the results of the work of Froehlich and others (1980), one would expect  the optimum water content for compaction from forest operations to be higher  than the value observed in the Montana tests and the resulting maximum compac-tion  to be lower. Field observations in the Montana soils showed their severely  compacted sites to have average bulk densities at the 5 cm depth of 1.01 Mg/m3  and 0.97 Mg/m3 for ash over quartzite or limestone till, respectively.  Although the relatively low bulk densities of ash cap soils make them very  susceptible to compaction, the resulting bulk densities of compacted soils sel-dom  exceed 1.0 Mg/m3. The impact of this degree of change in bulk density on  future forest productivity is not the subject of this paper but the general impact  of compaction on tree growth has been studied in a number of different settings  over the years (Froehlich 1979; Davis 1992; Powers and others 2004). While in-creased  bulk density associated with machine traffic has generally been shown  to reduce tree growth, the extent of the growth reduction in ash-cap soils is not  well documented. Growth reduction can possibly be attributed to a reduction  in the water holding capacity of the soil, but the change in pore-size distribution  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007 77  Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han  within the ash-cap soils after compaction may also affect tree growth (Powers  and others 2004). The use of 15% percent change that is used as a threshold  value for determining detrimental soil compaction by the USDA Forest Service  may be ineffective for all soils since each soil textural class varies in initial bulk  density value and biological significance of that change (Williamson and Neilsen  2000). Block and others (2002) suggest that combining soil bulk density or soil  strength measurements with a surface disturbance regime can be a useful method  for monitoring harvesting impacts on soil.  Case Studies of Operations on Ash-Cap Soils________________________  Compaction on some ash-cap soils has been found to persist for long periods  of time, particularly at depths of 15 cm and greater. Geist and others (1989) found  significant compaction on study sites sampled 14 to 23 years after harvest in the  Blue Mountains of Oregon. Although average bulk densities did not vary greatly  between harvested and undisturbed area for most sites, 0.67 Mg/m3 on undisturbed  versus 0.71 Mg/m3 on harvested, there was a much wider range of bulk densities  in the disturbed areas indicating areas of significant compaction and areas of likely  displacement. In the most disturbed unit, average bulk density was 0.66 Mg/m3  on the undisturbed area and 0.80 Mg/m3 on the harvested area, but the range of  observed bulk densities on the disturbed sites was even wider.  Davis (1992) observed difference in bulk densities on disturbed and undisturbed  areas in an ash-cap soil with sandy loam texture. He found the average bulk  density of disturbed volcanic ash soils to be 35% higher than the undisturbed,  0.73 g/cm3 versus 0.98 g/cm3. He conducted standard and light Proctor tests on  the soil and determined a maximum bulk density with the standard Proctor test  of 1.07 g/cm3 at a moisture content of about 35%. He also found a relatively flat  curve across a range of moisture contents for lighter Proctor tests.  Another study conducted in the Blue Mountains of Oregon (Snider and Miller  1985) illustrates the impact of soil moisture content on operational results. They  established a statistical split-plot design to look at soil characteristics on skid trails,  on berms of trails, in obvious fire rings where slash had been piled and burned,  in areas with some general disturbance, and in undisturbed areas five years after  the last harvest/site preparation activity. Bulk densities in the control area aver-aged  0.68 Mg/m3 at the 3.2 cm depth, 0.89 Mg/m3 at the 10.8 cm depth and  0.92 Mg/m3 at the 18.4 cm depth. Generally there were no significant differences  in bulk densities at any depth among the four variations and the control. The  authors suggest that the reduced level of compaction may have been a function  of dry soil conditions during the period of operations.  An experiment on the Colville National Forest in northeastern Washington in-volved  analysis of harvesting economics and soil impacts for a number variations  in harvesting systems and trail spacing for harvesting equipment on both steep and  gentle slopes. The steep slope units involved use of a cable yarding system coupled  with mechanized harvesting equipment. One unit allowed downhill forwarding with  a ground-based cut-to-length forwarder. Gentle slope units were designed with varia-tions  in the designated trail spacing with some allowance for the felling machine to  travel off trail in some units (Johnson 1999; Keatley 2000; Johnson 2002).  Soil analysis involved bulk density and penetrometer measurements before and  after harvest operations (Landsberg and others 2003). Study conclusions suggest  78 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils  that compaction resulting from an earlier fire-salvage harvesting operation has  remained for at least 70 years. Conclusions note that compaction was not as  great on steep terrain where the cable based systems were used, but also note  that the soils were sandier in that area and were likely to be more resistant to  changes in soil strength. Changes in soil strength, as measured with a recording  penetrometer, showed an average of 127% increase in resistance to penetration  in the surface layer (0 to 10 cm) and an 89% increase in resistance to penetration  at depths of 15 to 25 cm on skid trails in the ground based units. This contrasts  to changes of –3% for the surface layer and 43% at depths of 15 to 25 cm in the  steeper units. Differences on and off skid trails at the 0 to 10 cm depth averaged  63% in the ground based units and 10% in the steep slopes. Differences at the  15-25 cm depth averaged 26% for both units. There were significant differences  between the types of harvesting system, however. For example, the differences  between on and off trail resistance to penetration for the cut-to-length system  was 15% at the 0 - 10 cm depth and 3% at the 15 - 25 cm depth. Soil conditions  after harvesting that remained within limits of the specified guidelines, but results  also reflected difficulties associated with interpretation of penetrometer results  when readings are taken over a full field season that includes significant changes  in soil moisture content (Landsberg and others 2003).  In one study, ash-cap soils in northern Idaho were shown to reach their maxi-mum  bulk density after 4 trips with a rubber-tired skidder. Subsequent trips did  not result in further increases in bulk density. However, pore-size distribution  continued to change after 4 or more trips (Lenhard 1986). Although bulk density  does not appear to change after several passes, other physical properties may  continue to change to the detriment of soil productivity. If soil pore-size distribu-tion  continues to change, then plant-water relationships are likely to be altered  or soil puddling will occur for longer periods of time.  The results reported on dry soils in northern Idaho by Froese (2004) were similar  to those reported in northeastern Oregon (Snider and Miller 1985). Froese’ thesis  work involved study of a cut-to-length system operating on ash cap soils. Bulk  densities in the control averaged 0.95 Mg/m3 at the 10 cm depth, 1.10 Mg/m3 at  the 20 cm depth and 1.21 Mg/m3 at the 30 cm depth. These values are higher  than typical bulk densities for ash-cap soils with minimal disturbance and may  have contributed to the lack of change after operations. They are also typical of  bulk densities measured on skid trails after machine operations as illustrated in  the case study for Western Montana (Cullen and others 1991). There was virtually  no change in bulk density after the passage of the harvester and one pass of the  forwarder. Some increase in bulk density was detected at the surface layer with  increased numbers of forwarder passes. Operations were also conducted in late  summer when soils were quite dry.  Cullen and others (1991) reported changes in bulk density as a result of ­traffic  at three soil depths on soils in Western Montana. Bulk density in the surface  layer of ash over a limestone till at 5 cm changed from 0.61 Mg/m3 with no traf-fic  to 0.84 Mg/m3 with moderate traffic and to 0.97 Mg/m3 with severe traffic.  The changes at 15 cm were also significant, changing from 0.53 Mg/m3 in the  undisturbed case to 0.97 Mg/m3 and 0.93 Mg/m3 for moderate and severe ­traffic  respectively. In their conclusions they note that the volcanic surface horizon  overlying the glacial till soils was well-graded, cohesionless, and was prone to  vibratory compaction.  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007 79  Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han  Controlling Compaction___________________________________________  Methods of limiting compaction impacts on soils generally involve control of  the traffic patterns of equipment, restriction of vehicles to designated trails and  areas, and control over the seasons of operation. Since topography plays a major  role in the redistribution of water on a site, depressions in the landscape may have  higher moisture content and be more prone to compaction damage than areas  higher on the landscape. Designated trails can avoid these sites when needed.  The use of low ground pressure machines and covering of trails with slash mats  such as those generated with cut-to-length systems can limit the consequences of  one or two passes of equipment, but do not appear to be effective in minimizing  soil compaction when equipment must use trails multiple times (Froese 2004; Han  2005). In several studies of mechanized equipment, one pass of the harvesting  machine did not appear to significantly change bulk density in the soils (Froese  2004; Han 2005). Subsequent passes of the skidding or forwarding equipment  did increase soil bulk densities, but compaction was limited to the percent of the  area in major trails or just in the ruts of well defined forwarder trails.  Increasing spacing between operational trails can decrease the overall impact  on an area, but can also have negative economic consequences because of the  increased cost of moving cut logs and trees increased distances to the operational  trails (Johnson 2002). Careful operational planning can mitigate some of the higher  costs associated with increased trail spacing, however. It may also be possible to  allow the felling equipment to operate in a limited fashion off established trails  and to bunch harvested material to the trail for processing and/or forwarding.  Limiting operations during periods of high soil moisture content will also limit  soil impacts. This generally will translate into seasonal restrictions on equipment,  with most operations taking place in late summer and early fall. Dry soils (&lt;15%  soil moisture content) can effectively support higher ground pressures and result  in more limited soil compaction to the surface mineral soil (&gt;10 cm) (Han 2005).  Winter operations may be possible with minimal soil impact if the ground is  frozen to depths of 10 to 15 cm (Flatten 2002) or has sufficient snow cover (at  least 15 cm).  Another option for minimizing soil compaction, but which can also have  significant economic consequences is to shift from ground-based harvesting to  cable or helicopter harvesting systems. Both of these options can be structured  to have minimal soil impacts, but will generally incur higher costs than ground-based  systems.  Summary and Suggested Areas of Future Research_ ________________  Ash-cap soils are derived from a variety of volcanic eruptions and are most often  classified in the silt or sandy loam categories. They are also characterized with  low bulk density, high porosity, and high water holding capacity. They tend to be  non-cohesive and because of their relatively low strength, are highly susceptible  to both vibratory and compressive compaction. Compaction is generally viewed  in a negative context with respect to long-term site productivity and sustainable  forest management. The results of several studies in the intermountain west illus-trate  that both bulk density and soil strength values were significantly increased  during ground-based harvest operations, but that the resulting bulk densities of  compacted ash-cap soils are often below the initial bulk densities of other soil  80 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Johnson, Page-Dumroese and Han Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils  textures. The long-term effects of the changes in factors on site productivity still  need to be studied through controlled experiments.  Since ash-cap soils have relatively low bulk densities before operations, they  may experience a very high percent change in soil strength and bulk density. In  setting standards, it is not clear whether the focus should be on the final bulk  density or soil strength reading, the absolute amount of change, or the percent  change. If soil strength, as measured by the penetrometer, is recommended as a  standard method for soil measurement, corresponding threshold levels of percent  and absolute change will need to be established.  The process of soil compaction can be explained by engineering properties  of soils, but the degree of soil compaction created in field settings is highly in-fluenced  by a variety of factors including distribution of particle sizes, presence  of organic matter, soil moisture content, and soil texture. Bulk density and soil  strength are commonly used to measure the degree of soil compaction, but the  statistical correlations between two variables can be very low when soil strength  is not measured near field capacity of the soil. The relationships between bulk  density and soil strength and the other critical soil factors such as water holding  capacity is less clear, however. Additional work is also needed to determine the  effect of the depth of the ash-cap on soil response to machine traffic.  Although ash-cap soils are susceptible to both vibratory and compression  forces, the specific vibratory and compressive force potential of the equipment  operating in various harvesting and site preparation functions (cutting, transport-ing)  is not known. Research on the vibratory effects of equipment and whether  changes in machine design could reduce this effect would be very useful to forest  management strategies.  Several studies also found that changes in bulk density and soil strength in  ash-cap are long term (&gt;70 years) and that recovery time for ash-cap soils is ex-pected  to be slow. These studies noted that soil compaction was generally limited  to skid trails and top soil layers (&lt;30 cm). Harvesting equipment used, season of  operation and harvest planning were major factors in affecting soil compaction.  Controlling compaction often involves use of low impact equipment selection,  use of designated skid trails, and limitation of operations to dry seasons or when  the ground is frozen. The use of low ground pressure machines and covering trails  with slash in a cut-to-length logging may help reduce impacts on soils, especially  soil displacement.

Phylogeographic Patterns of Armillaria ostoyae in the Western United States,"Hanna, J.W.; Klopfenstein, N.B.; Kim, M.S.; McDonald, G.I.; Moore, J.A.","Nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (i.e. large subunit, internal transcribed spacer, 5.8S and intergenic spacer) were sequenced using a direct-polymerase chain reaction method from Armillaria ostoyae genets collected from the western USA. Many of the A. ostoyae genets contained heterogeneity among rDNA repeats, indicating intragenomic variation and likely intraspecific hybridization. Intragenomic variation was verified by visually editing base-sequence offsets in regions with insertions/deletions, and using sequence-specific internal primers to resequence heterogeneous regions. Phylogenetic analyses with Bayesian Inference methods were used to define groups within A. ostoyae. Analysis of A. ostoyae from outside the western USA indicated the presence of a Circumboreal group of A. ostoyae that also occurs in Utah; two other phylogeographic groups were associated with the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest regions of the USA. Mixed sequence types, an indication of intraspecific hybrids, were common in some geographic regions. Hybridization events may have influenced species evolution, contributing to variation in pathogenicity and virulence. The occurrence of these groups and intraspecific hybrids also indicates that paleogeography and paleoclimate may have influenced the phylogeography of A. ostoyae. In addition, other Armillaria species were examined for evolutionary relationships with the groups of A. ostoyae.

Ecological and Topographic Features of  Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils  Mark Kimsey, Brian Gardner, and Alan Busacca  Introduction  Volcanic ash from eruptions along the Pacific Northwest Cascade Range has signifi­cantly  influenced forest soils of the Inland Northwest, U.S.A. (Mullineaux 1986; Shipley and  ­Sarna‑Wojcicki  1983). The Holocene era eruption of Mt. Mazama (now Crater Lake, OR)  distributed &gt;116 km3 of volcanic tephra across this region (Bacon 1983; Zdanowicz and ­others  1999). Soils influenced by the deposition of Mt. Mazama tephra can be found throughout  the western United States and into southwestern Canada (fig. 1). Soils formed in, or influ-enced  by volcanic ash are important to forest management. Volcanic ash-influenced soils  have lower bulk density, higher porosity, and higher water infiltration and retention than  soils less influenced or unaffected by ash (McDaniel and others 2005; Nanzyo and others  1993; Nimlos 1980; Warkentin and Maeda 1980). Among the benefits of these properties is  the reduction in drought stress on plant communities during extended summer dry periods.  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils  Regional deposition following the eruption of Mt. Mazama was estimated at  approximately 15-20 cm thick in eastern Washington, with thinning in areas more  distal to the eruption (Busacca and others 2001). The current distribution pat-tern  of volcanic glass derived from the Mazama event is much different than this  original deposition pattern. A map depicting the prevalence of volcanic glass in  modern surface soils of Eastern Washington indicates only weak tephra influence  in soils of the southwest Columbia Plateau even though these areas are closest  to the volcanic source of the tephra (fig. 2) (Busacca and others 2001). Instead,  glass content of the surface soils increases with increasing downwind distance  from the source volcano. Also, none of the modern tephra-influenced surface  soils are composed of pure volcanic ejecta. Soils of the Blue Mountains, OR, and  Clearwater Mountains, ID, have some of the best-expressed andic soil properties  Figure 1—Estimated spatial distribution of Mt. Mazama volcanic ash  across the western United States and southwestern Canada. The study  area for this research project is located within the boxed area of north-central  Idaho (Mt. Mazama ash distribution adapted from Williams and  Goles 1968).  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca  in the region, yet these soils generally have glass contents of 20 to 50 percent in  their surface layers.  Several mechanisms have been proposed as factors in the transformation of  the original tephra sheet into the mixed distribution patterns that we see. These  include: 1) a partial re-entrainment of ash by wind with resulting redeposition  further downwind (i.e. to the northeast); 2) burial of ash material by subsequent  episodes of loess deposition; 3) bioturbation of the tephra by soil fauna, which  served to mix the volcanic glass into the surrounding soil mass; and 4) reduced  erosion loss and enhanced capture of remobilized air-fall material under coniferous  vegetation such as is found at the northern and eastern margins of the Columbia  Plateau (Busacca and others 2001; Hunter 1988).  Recent Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) soil surveys have ex-tensively  mapped volcanic ash-influenced forest soils in portions of the Inland  Northwest. From these surveys, ash distribution and ecological/topographic  relationships can be assessed. However, these soil survey relationships are often  presented as a range in ash thickness. For example, volcanic ash thicknesses  in Hugus and Bouldercreek soil series commonly found in our study area have  mapped variations &gt;20 cm (Soil Survey Division 2006). As more information is  gathered on the role of volcanic ash in forest productivity and management, for-est  managers may need finer resolution of ash distribution than a range in ash  thickness. The inherent variation of soil surveys may not provide the level of ac-curacy  needed for decision support systems. A potentially workable alternative  is a statistical re-analysis of individual soil-site descriptions created during local  NRCS soil surveys.  Figure 2—Volcanic glass content of modern surface soils in eastern Washington (from Busacca  and others 2001).  10 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils  Based on the above rationale, our objective was to select a relatively small  geographic region within the Inland Northwest for which extensive soil and envi-ronmental  data was available to 1) develop a dataset of volcanic ash depths, habitat  types, and terrain features; 2) conduct statistical analyses to assess relationships  between ash thickness and selected vegetative and topographic features; and 3)  determine the precision and fit of a statistical model to estimate the thickness of  volcanic ash across a landscape.  Materials and Methods___________________________________________  Study Area  The area chosen for this study is the NRCS ID-612 soil survey region of north-central  Idaho (fig. 1). This survey area encompasses about 336,250 ha of diverse  climatic factors, habitat types, and complex terrain attributes. Landscapes of this  region are generally characterized as mountainous in the north and east, while  the south and west are characterized as basalt plateaus/benchland incised with  deep canyons. Elevation ranges from 300 m in the southwest to &gt;1700 m in the  north and east. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) roughly follows the elevational  gradient, with &lt;300 mm MAP in the southwest and &gt;1500 mm in the northeast.  Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var.  glauca) habitat types dominate the southern regions of the soil survey. Western  redcedar (Thuja plicata) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) dominate the  warm, moist upland regions; with Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and mountain  hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) predominant in the colder, higher elevations (Cooper  and others 1991).  Data Analysis  Nine hundred and twenty-one soil-site descriptions and their XY coordinates  were obtained from the Orofino, ID, NRCS field office. Field records composed  of volcanic ash thickness, terrain attribute, and habitat type observations were  entered into a database. The effective number of observations available for analyses  varied since it was not unusual for certain field observations to not be recorded  on the field form. A summary of the field descriptors and their potential influence  on volcanic ash distribution is presented in table 1.  The continuous variables elevation (ELE), slope (SLP), and aspect (ASP) were  grouped into discrete classes to facilitate the comparison of incremental changes  in ash thickness with terrain attributes. ELE was classed into 200-m intervals, SLP  at 10 percent breaks, and ASP in 45-degree quadrants. Curvature values were  derived from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) 30-m digital elevation  model (DEM) using grid algebra in a geographic information system (GIS). The  numerical curvature values were then grouped into their respective linear (L),  concave (C), and convex (C) classes.  Average ash thickness by class was computed for each of the variables described  above. Standard errors were computed and t-tests performed to test for significant  differences in ash thickness using an α-level of 0.1. Variables that showed signifi-cant  class differences in volcanic ash thickness were subsequently tested for use  as predictor variables in a volcanic ash distribution model.

Variables that were within the upper 0.1 percentile of a Type III sums-of-  squares F-distribution were retained within the model. The prediction equation  was deemed reliable if it produced a high coefficient of determination (R2) and  low root mean square error (RMSE).  Results__________________________________________________________  Topographic and Vegetative Indicators  Volcanic ash is highly correlated with ELE (fig. 2). Each 200-m increment is  significantly different up to 1200 m (p &lt;0.1). Above 1200 m, there is no significant  difference in mean ash thickness. Forest soils below 600 m in elevation have ash  thicknesses ≤10 cm. Many low elevation soils exhibit significant mixing of the  shallow ash mantle with underlying soil material. These lower elevation forest  soils are classified as vitrandic subgroups of a soil order (Soil Survey Staff 1999).  Forest soils located at elevations between 600 m and 1200 m have mean ash  thicknesses 24 to 35 cm. These soils are classified as andic subgroups. Volcanic  ash mantles have a mean thickness of about 45 cm above 1200 m elevation. Ash  mantles deeper than 36 cm that meet several other NRCS criteria are considered  members of the order Andisols (Soil Survey Staff 1999) or Andosols of the World  Reference Base (FAO/ISRIC/ISSS 1998).  Mean ash thickness showed no significant decrease with increasing slope gradient  (fig. 3). Mean ash thickness showed relatively little variation with a small range of  25 to 34 cm across all slope classes. Slopes &lt;10 percent showed significantly less  volcanic ash than all classes except the 60 percent class. Ash depth increases up  Figure 3—Mean volcanic ash thickness as a function of elevation (ELE)  class. Y-axis bars represent standard errors, with letters indicating significant  ­differences  (p &lt; 0.1).

The 20 to 30 percent class had significantly greater  ash depths than all slope classes and was marginally greater than the 40 to 50  percent class (p = 0.12).  North aspects generally exhibit thicker ash mantles than south facing aspects  (fig. 4). N, NW, and SE aspects show mean ash depths &gt;32 cm. NE and W facing  aspects have thinner ash caps (~30 cm), but are not significantly different than N,  NW, or SE aspects. S, SW, and E aspects have significantly thinner ash mantles  of about 27 cm.  Figure 4—Mean volcanic ash thickness as a function of slope (SLP) class. Y-axis bars represent  standard errors, with letters indicating significant differences (p &lt; 0.1).  Slope curvature shows that nonlinear surfaces retain a greater thickness of  volcanic ash compared to linear surfaces (fig. 5). Concave and convex surfaces  show mean ash depths &gt;30 cm for both upslope (PRCU) and across slope (PLCU)  surface curvature. Linear surfaces in both PRCU and PLCU are significantly lower  (&lt;25 cm) than either convex or concave surfaces. There was no statistical differ-ence  between concave and convex in either PRCU or PLCU slope curvature.  Vegetation series and habitat type plant associations showed the strongest rela-tionship  with volcanic ash thickness (fig. 6). Overall, the ponderosa pine (PIPO)  and Douglas-fir (PSME) vegetation series have very thin volcanic ash mantles  (&lt;3 cm) and show no significant change by habitat type within series. Grand fir  (Abies grandis – ABGR) has the widest range in ash-influence of all vegetation  series. Mean ash thickness ranges from 0 to 40 cm depending on the underlying  habitat type within series.

Ash thickness in ABGR habitat types can be described as a func-tion  of increasingly moist understory indicator species, with the exception of LIBO.  Habitat type rankings for volcanic ash thickness would be LIBO &lt; PHMA/SYAL  &lt; CLUN &lt; ASCA, where PHMA, SYAL, CLUN, and ASCA represent ninebark  (Physocarpus malvaceus), snowberry (Symphoricarpus albus), queen-cup beadlily  (Clintonia uniflora), and wild ginger (Asarum caudatum), respectively. These rank-ings  suggest that vitrandic intergrades would be more prevalent on PHMA/SYAL  and LIBO habitat types, andic intergrades on CLUN, and Andisols on ASCA.  Changing from an ABGR to a western redcedar (THPL) vegetation series is  accompanied by a 5-cm increase in mean ash thickness when comparing across  CLUN habitat types. This shift is not evident for the ASCA habitat type, which  shows no significant differences between ABGR and THPL vegetation series.  Maiden­hair  fern (Adiantum pedatum – ADPE) and oak-fern (Gymnocarpium  dryopteris – GYDR) habitat types show a reduction of &gt;7 cm in mean ash thickness  over ABGR/THPL-ASCA. Mean ash thickness for CLUN and ADPE/GYDR habitat  types suggest that andic intergrades would be most common, with Andisols (in  other words, ash mantle &gt;36 cm) occurring primarily under an ASCA habitat type.  Based on these observations, understory rankings of habitat type by increasing  ash thickness would be CLUN = ADPE/GYDR &lt; ASCA.  The western hemlock (TSHE) series displayed the largest difference in volcanic  ash thickness between CLUN and ASCA habitat types (about 28 cm). TSHE-CLUN  habitat types show at least a 6-cm decrease in mean ash thickness when  compared to THPL-CLUN; however, a TSHE-CLUN habitat type would still fall  within the andic intergrade classification associated with other CLUN habitat  types. Ash thickness in the ASCA habitat type is significantly greater for TSHE  vegetation series than for any other series with observed ASCA habitat types.  Mean ash depths on TSHE-ASCA are 54 cm, which would place them well within  the Andisol soil order.  Mountain hemlock (TSME) and subalpine fir (ABLA) series are typically found at  higher elevations where air temperatures are relatively low and annual precipitation  high. The warmer, moister ASCA habitat was not observed. Mean ash thickness  is greater on TSME-CLUN than ABLA-CLUN, but the difference is insignificant.  Volcanic ash-thickness on these vegetation series is &gt;36 cm, thus placing them  into the Andisol order.  Volcanic Ash Distribution Modeling  The class variables listed in table 1 were added stepwise into a multiple linear  regression equation. Variables were assumed to be independent and normally  distributed. The final model, with selected variables acting as fixed effects on  volcanic ash thickness, is:  ATjklmno = μ + PRCUj + ASPk + SLPl + ELEm + VS*HTn + εjklmno  where,  ATjklmno is the predicted value for observation o with vegetation series*habitat  type interaction n at elevation m on slope l with aspect k and upslope  curvature j,  16 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils  μ is overall volcanic ash thickness mean,  PRCUj is the fixed effect of upslope curvature (concave, convex, or linear),  ASPk is the fixed effect of aspect (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or FLAT),  SLPl is the fixed effect of percent slope (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50,  50-60,or 60+),  ELEm is the fixed effect of elevation in meters (200-400, 400-600, 600-800,  800-1000, 1000-1200, 1200-1400, 1400+),  VS*HTn is the fixed effect of vegetation series*habitat interaction (where, VS are  ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, grand fir, western redcedar, western hemlock,  mountain hemlock, or subalpine fir; and HT are Idaho fescue, ninebark/  snowberry, twinflower, queen-cup beadlily, wild ginger, or maidenhair fern/  oak-fern),  εjklmno is the error term;  where, j = 3 for upslope curvature, k = 9 for aspect, l = 7 for slope, m = 7 for  elevation, n = 13 for vegetation series*habitat type interaction, and o = 1 for  number of observations per location.  All class variables, except PLCU, explained a significant portion of variation in  volcanic ash thickness (p &lt; 0.1) (table 2). Variables ranked from least to most in  variance explained are PRCU &lt; ASP &lt; SLP &lt; ELE &lt; VS*HT. The interaction term,  VS*HT, accounted for the largest percentage of explained variance at 71.2 percent.  ELE was the second largest at 18.2 percent. SLP and ASP accounted for 8.9 percent  combined, and PRCU explained the least at 1.7 percent. The overall model was  significant (p &lt;0.001) and accounted for 60 percent of the observed variation in  ash thickness. A model RMSE of 10.7 cm and CV of 36 percent indicate that there  is a significant amount of variation still unaccounted for; however, the predictive  error is significantly lower than the variation found in local soil series.

Discussion_______________________________________________________  Ecological and Topographic Indicators  It is evident from the broad relationships presented that volcanic ash distribu-tion  is strongly associated with vegetation patterns and less dependent on terrain  attributes. Elevation, although a topographic feature, shows strong collinearity  with local precipitation gradients and vegetative cover (data not shown). This  situation suggests that elevation serves locally as a proxy variable for interactions  between precipitation and vegetation patterns and their subsequent effect on ash  distribution.  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007 17  Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca  Slope class did not have a negative impact on mean ash thickness with slopes  &gt;60 percent showing no significant decline in ash depths (fig. 3). This result sup-ports  other research on slope stability of volcanic ash. In a review of volcanic ash  soils, Warkentin and Maeda (1980) note that volcanic ash on free-standing slopes  up to 70 degrees are common in regions of high rainfall. They attribute this high  degree of stability to the unique permeability of volcanic ash.  The significantly lower mean ash thickness in the 0-to-10 percent slope class  may be due to the geographic location of these observations. A majority of these  observations for nearly flat terrain were on the benchlands of the south and  southwest portion of the study area. This region is characterized by low elevation  PSME and ABGR vegetation series, which often exhibit thin or mixed volcanic  ash mantles.  The prevalence of thicker ash mantles on north aspects may be attributable to  several factors (fig. 4). North aspects typically support moister plant communities  in our study area (Cooper and others 1991). These moist plant communities may  provide greater soil surface cover, which would decrease the impact of precipitation  and overland water flow on volcanic ash redistribution. Additionally, the moisture  retained within the soils after precipitation events would be less susceptible to  evaporation from solar radiation. Giest and Strickler (1978) found volcanic ash  soils of Oregon to be susceptible to wind erosion once in a dry state. Assuming  that current southwesterly prevailing wind patterns were similar to historic post-eruption  patterns, dry volcanic ash on south-facing slopes would be expected to  be more susceptible to redistribution by wind than north aspects. The significant  increase in ash thickness on southeast slopes is anomalous to this theory and  suggests that the overall effect of aspect on ash distribution is local and intricately  tied with surrounding topographic and environmental factors.  The significant decrease in ash thickness on linear surfaces shown in figure 5  is partially correlated with the slope class these observations share. A review of  the dataset shows that about 67 percent of the linear surfaces occur on slopes  &lt;10 percent with the remainder unevenly divided among several steeper slope  classes. As detailed in the previous discussion of slope classes, observations with  gradients &lt;10 percent are found primarily in the drier benchland portions of the  study area. The correlation between slope steepness and slope surface curvature  within the dataset may mask local effects of slope curvature on ash thickness.  Surprisingly, convex surfaces in both upslope and across slope positions displayed  no significant decrease in mean ash thickness over concave surfaces. Other re-search  on volcanic ash deposition after the eruption of Mt. St. Helens has shown  that concave surfaces support thicker ash mantles than convex (Zobel and Antos  1991). Our conflicting results may be due to the level of variation found within  these classes. Standard errors were small because of large sample sizes, but the  standard deviations were often large within the surface classes, reflecting signifi-cant  variation within the data.  Cooper and others (1991) associate shifts in climax plant associations to dis-tinctive  soil and/or topographic microclimate features. Habitat type shifts and  differing soil ash depth are evident across the broad habitat type associations  observed in our study area (fig. 7). These strong relationships may be attributed  to many combinations of topographic, climatic, or edaphic factors. Steele and  others (1981) noted that the influence of volcanic ash contributed to distinct shifts  in Idaho plant communities. However, it is still an open question as to whether  18 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils  the presence of volcanic ash is responsible for shifts in plant associations, or that  variations in plant community were responsible for differential ash retention.  Despite this uncertainty, volcanic ash thickness is highly correlated with plant  associations and can be used to assess ash distribution patterns.  PSME and PIPO vegetation series show the least ash thickness within our data.  Shifts to moister habitat types within these vegetation series show no significant  dependence on volcanic ash. It has been suggested that these vegetation series  now reside on landscapes that, post-Mazama eruption, were drier and did not  support forest vegetation cover. Lack of overstory cover and dry climatic condi-tions  prevented these landscapes from retaining volcanic ash mantles subsequent  to the eruption.  Volcanic ash thickness in ABGR communities is highly variable. Unlike suc-cessively  moister plant associations, an ABGR vegetation series does not always  indicate the presence of significant volcanic ash influence. This variability is  partly attributable to the transition zone that ABGR inhabits between xeric and  udic soil moisture regimes. Near the dry end of the spectrum, ABGR plant com-munities  would be associated with minimal to no ash influence. This suggests  that an increase in plant available soil moisture would shift the understory plant  community towards moister habitat types. Thus, drier habitat types (PHMA/SYAL)  often exhibit less ash influence in the soil than the CLUN and ASCA types.  An exception to this pattern is the ABGR-LIBO association. LIBO is considered  to inhabit moister environments than PHMA, suggesting that volcanic ash might  be present on this habitat type. The absence of volcanic ash on LIBO habitat  types may be attributable to the fact that only five observations were collected  Figure 7—Mean volcanic ash thickness as a function of overstory (VS) and understory (HT) indicator  plant ­species.  Y-axis bars represent standard errors, with letters indicating significant differences  (p &lt; 0.1) (Cooper and others 1991).  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007 19  Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca  within this habitat type, providing for a poor representation of the range in ash  thickness.  All remaining plant associations moister than ABGR show significant ash  ­influence  in the soil. The presence of a thick ash mantle is often identified by the  presence of these climax species. Increasing ash thickness in the soil is evident  in the habitat type gradients within the THPL series; however, habitat type dif-ferences  are minimal.  The TSHE vegetation series occupies a narrow ecological range in north Idaho  forests and primarily inhabits moist, moderate temperature sites and are intoler-ant  to drought, excess moisture, and frost (Cooper and others 1991). The narrow  ecological range suggests that other edaphic and climatic factors might play a  larger role in TSHE distribution than volcanic ash influence in the soil. Such factors  may also explain why TSHE-CLUN plant associations have thinner ash mantles  than THPL-CLUN. TSHE-ASCA sites do show significant increases in volcanic ash  thickness. This result suggests that volcanic ash is associated with a shift to moister  understory plant communities within the TSHE vegetation series.  TSME and ABLA plant communities occupy high elevation sites with up to  1500 mm of annual precipitation within our study area. Vegetation series within  these zones are probably not dependent on the presence of volcanic ash for their  establishment. The high precipitation and dense vegetative cover of these plant  communities retained volcanic ash subsequent to original ash deposition.  Volcanic Ash Distribution Modeling  The strength of the relationships between elevation, plant communities, and  volcanic ash produces a strong predictive ability for our ash distribution model.  An R2 value of 0.6 is considered an excellent improvement over the limited re-gional  volcanic ash modeling attempts (Nimlos and Zuuring 1982). Predictions  from this model allow quantitative ash assessments with a known error within  the study area. Forest managers can use this model to integrate the predictions  into a geographic information system (GIS). One motivation behind developing  a quantitative ash distribution model was to overcome the variation inherent  within mapping units generated through a soil survey. Volcanic ash thicknesses  in Hugus and Bouldercreek soil series commonly found in our study area have  mapped variations &gt;20 cm (Soil Survey Division 2006). The predictive model’s  RMSE of 10.7 cm significantly improves on this level of variation, thus providing  a finer resolution support tool for local forest soil management.  Further research should be conducted to determine local affects of topographic  features on ash distribution despite the significant improvement this model pro-vides  in predicting ash depth and distribution. Global statistical procedures such  as multiple linear regression may mask local topographic influence. Adjusting a  statistical model to perform a more local analysis may yield improved results. A  more costly, but perhaps informative method, would be a detailed survey of a  finite landscape. Research at local levels may reveal topographic and volcanic  ash relationships otherwise masked by large conventional soil surveys. Regard-less  of which approach is used, modeling ash distribution seems to be inherently  a local exercise. The extrapolation of model results outside a study area is not  recommended. The concepts behind the model presented in this paper may be  applicable elsewhere, but the relationships as reflected in the model parameter  estimates are unique.  20 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-44. 2007  Kimsey, Gardner, and Busacca Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils  Summary_ ______________________________________________________  This study’s findings suggest that volcanic ash distribution is intricately linked  with elevation and plant community associations. Elevation increases precipita-tion,  which in turn supports different climax plant communities. Increasing plant  density at each successive climax community may serve to retain ash deposits  subsequent to volcanic eruptions and entrap wind-transported volcanic ash from  drier, lower elevation sites. Topographic variables show relatively little impact  on ash thickness patterns. Several of the terrain attributes showed clustering by  geographic location within our study area. Gentler slopes, which were predomi-nately  found at drier, lower elevations, supported thinner ash mantles. The slope  curvature variable was also linked to geographic location. Nonlinear slopes were  most often found in the mountainous region of the study area. The strong effect  of elevation and vegetation habitat type series reduced the ability to distinguish  mean ash thickness differences between convex and concave surfaces.  Statistical modeling accounted for 60 percent of the observed variation in ash  thickness and returned an RMSE of 10.7 cm. These model statistics indicate a  significant development in the prediction capability of volcanic ash thickness.  Model error is significantly lower than the variation of &gt;20 cm often observed in  local ash-influenced soil series. However, it became evident during our analyses  that ash distribution and thickness is heavily influenced by local ecological and  topographic attributes that cannot be assumed to affect ash depth uniformly  across a study area. Future ash modeling efforts must focus on assessing local  environmental influences and account for nonstationarity in the independent  variables. Such an analysis may clarify the ecological and topographic effects on  ash distribution and thickness that are otherwise generalized in a global regres-sion  analysis.

Keywords : bioenergy, bio-oil, carbon sequestration, fuels reduction, soil  ­productivity  Introduction  Forest biomass accumulation is both a problem and an opportunity. Increas-ing  forest biomass is a consequence of continuous forest growth, effective fire  suppression tactics, lack of harvest activities, and other management practices.  Young growing forest stands quickly become overstocked with numerous small  diameter tree stems, slowing individual tree growth and causing stem exclusion  processes to initiate (Oliver and Larson 1990). Prior to implementing effective fire  suppression tactics, some fire-adapted ecosystems (i.e. low-elevation, frequent  fire regime forests), burned regularly, often as cooler understory fires or moder-ate  severity fires that served to limit biomass accumulation, release nutrients  160 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-61. 2010.  Coleman, Page-Dumroese, Archuleta, Badger, Chung, Venn, Loeffler, Jones and McElligott Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using…  and improve stand vigor (Agee 1996; Stanturf and others 2002). Pre-commercial  thinning is also used to restore ecological function (Thibodeau and others 2000).  Without frequent burning or thinning such overstocked forests contain abundant  ground level biomass and experience considerable mortality of subordinate trees  as dominant stems emerge. This fuel buildup has resulted in high-severity stand  replacing fires, which captures the attention of those living in developments at  the wild land interface. As a consequence of increasing wildfire occurrence and  intensity, public land managers in fire-prone areas have once again begun to thin  overstocked stands with a focus on fuels reduction, even though the area actually  being treated is small relative to that in need of treatment.  Removed biomass adds to the equally large volume of biomass that is commonly  found at landings of logging operations where whole-tree yarding is practiced  (Perlack and others 2005). This accumulated biomass from thinning and harvesting  practices is typically flared to avoid continued risk of fire as the slash piles dry.  Onsite flaring releases greenhouse gases, energy and carbon captured by natural  forest processes, and concentrates nutrients at burn pile locations.  Opportunity for Bioenergy  Utilization of biomass offers a potential solution to the problem of hazard fuel  accumulation. Developing markets for biomass may provide managers and land  owners a way to achieve management objectives if forest operators have a vi-able  opportunity to sell biomass and land managers have the ability to contract  for product removal. Potential markets for biomass utilization include products  such as small-wood furniture and structures, garden mulch, bioenergy, chemi-cals,  and other products (Hakkila 1989; LeVan-Green and Livingston 2003). Of  particular interest at this time is abundant energy contained in biomass that can  be tapped as an alternative to fossil fuels and avoid greenhouse gas emissions.  Bioenergy production is most attractive when fossil fuel energy prices increase,  but as greenhouse gas emissions become an increasing concern it also causes us  to look for alternative, renewable and low emissions energy sources. Bioenergy  production from forests may meet that need. It is particularly interesting with the  coincident occurrence of enhanced energy security needs, requirements to reduce  emissions of carbon, and the requirement to remove biomass from forest stands.  Biomass utilization for bioenergy has a long history. Much of the nation’s energy  needs were met by wood fuel prior to widespread use of coal and petroleum. Even  now it is common to find combined heat and power production operations where  there are abundant biomass supplies such as in pulp mills and lumber yards. Recent  interest has also been spurred by government programs promoting alternatives  such as heat for schools, prisons, hospitals, etc. (Richter and others 2009). Even  with this level of utilization, there is still over 300 million tons of unused bio-mass  coming available annually nationwide (Perlack and others 2005). However,  adoption of bioenergy production practices typically occurs only where there is  a ready biomass supply on site, such as forest product facilities, or where modest  feedstock requirements are met within close proximity to the energy conversion  facility, such as a low-demand educational heating facility in a forested region.  The importance of the biomass supply being localized to minimize transport  costs cannot be overstated. While there are significant costs for biomass removal,  those costs may be exceeded by revenue gained through the sale of that material  to a local conversion facility (Evans 2008). However, delivery to distant conver-sion  facilities frequently causes the delivered cost to exceed revenues making  the biomass utilization process economically unviable (Stokes and others 1993).  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-61. 2010. 161  Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using… Coleman, Page-Dumroese, Archuleta, Badger, Chung, Venn, Loeffler, Jones and McElligott  Consequently, despite abundant supply, biomass is commonly not removed for uti-lization  due to expenditures exceeding potential revenues and instead is cut, piled  and burned at significant expense and with important consequences to consider.  Biomass Disposal Concerns  Both off- and on-site consequences occur from pile-burning biomass. Dried  biomass is about 50 percent carbon and when biomass slash piles are flared that  carbon is oxidized and released back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or other  organic compounds. Such disposal is questionable in light of efforts to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon. In addition to volatilizing car-bon,  other essential plant nutrients are also lost from the site by burning. These  losses include several processes such as oxidation, vaporization, convective ash  losses, leaching and erosion (Fisher and Binkley 2000). The two main inorganic  nutrients lost to oxidation are nitrogen and sulfur, which are typically released  as air pollutants in the smoke produced by open-air burning. Phosphorous can  also be lost, but in lower quantities than nitrogen and sulfur. In hot fires, such  as in well seasoned slash piles, oxidative losses of nitrogen can be 25-65 percent  and for sulfur they can be 25-90 percent. These nutrients are frequently growth  limiting in forest environments (Fox and others 2007; Kishchuk and Brockley  2002), so it is equally unwise to cause such losses rather than conserving onsite  stores. Nutrients are also lost from site in smoke emissions. Convective losses of  particulates occur during burning that contain the full range of mineral nutrients  found in biomass, many of which are concentrated in ash (Fisher and Binkley  2000). Finally, other pollutants including particulates, carbon monoxide, and a  variety of volatile aromatic carbon compounds are also released in smoke (U.S.  National Research Council 2004). These pollutants are typically regulated in  urban and agricultural areas requiring permits to release. Smoke management  procedures are also in place to limit forest biomass pile burning to favorable  atmospheric conditions (e.g. http://www.smokemu.org/).  Piling and burning slash concentrates nutrients in the fire ring, which may lead  to lower average site productivity. The site preparation practice of shearing, piling  and burning was discontinued in southern pine plantations after it was recognized  that the redistribution of nutrients resulted in productivity declines (Carter and  Foster 2006). Similar results were observed in other regions (Binkley 1986), some  of which may be explained by topsoil displacement as well as biomass redistribu-tion.  Regardless, the concentration of biomass into piles and release of nutrients  localizes nutrients and can potentially saturate nutrient exchange capacity in the  burned area, leading to greater leaching loss.  While utilization of abundant forest biomass for bioenergy is appealing, it  too may result in removal of nutrients from sites. Environmental critics of forest  bioenergy production systems frequently cite the concern of nutrient removal  and over-exploitation of the resource as an expected negative consequence of  biomass harvesting for energy production (Kimmins 1997). We know from timber  harvesting that bole-only removal has an undetectable impact on the regrowth of  subsequent forest stands; however, if we remove whole trees from nutrient poor  sites, impacts on growth of the next forest rotation have been detected (Kimmins  2004). More certainly we know that removing litter and displacing soil will have  significant impact on the next rotation (Fleming and others 2006; Van Miegroet  and Johnson 2009). But we have little or no information on the impacts of  removing small diameter biomass material, such as tops, branches and needles  that contain high concentrations of nutrients (Evans 2008; Palviainen and oth-ers  2004). We do not know if those removals will impact subsequent forest  162 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-61. 2010.  Coleman, Page-Dumroese, Archuleta, Badger, Chung, Venn, Loeffler, Jones and McElligott Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using…  productivity, but it will likely depend on the inherent site quality, the frequency  and intensity of harvest and the ability of the site to replenish nutrients removed  (Kimmins 2004). The forest system is resilient and maintains large stocks of  nutrients that, given adequate time, can meet the requirements of forest growth,  but an accelerated frequency of removal may exceed the replenishment capacity.  Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand the implications of biomass  removal. A sustained bioenergy production system might include removing the  energy and not the nutrients, or returning the nutrients after energy is extracted  from the biomass.  Pyrolytic Biomass Conversion Solution  Both profit and sustainability are essential where financial analysis controls  the viability of alternative energy projects and the feedstock derives from vener-ated  forested ecosystems. The mobile fast pyrolysis bioenergy production system  (Badger and Fransham 2006) may be one approach to profitable and sustainable  biomass utilization. The mobile pyrolysis unit has potential to cover the cost of  biomass removal through the production of a crude oil product known as “bio-oil”  that has higher density and energy content than biomass. In addition to the bio-oil,  there is also a “bio-char” byproduct that has market value of its own, but might  best be used by returning it to the site of energy extraction as a soil amendment  and as a means of soil carbon sequestration. Such an approach has recently been  advocated for agricultural systems (Laird 2008; Lehmann and others 2006), but  it makes even greater sense for forest ecosystems when the bio-char is produced  at and immediately returned to the site of energy extraction.  Table 1 shows value comparisons for fast-pyrolysis products. The pyrolysis  actually has three product phases: gas, liquid and solid (Bridgwater 2004). The  flammable gas is used to fuel the pyrolysis process in a self sustaining combustion.  So although in some situations the heating value of the gas can be quantified as a  product, in this case it provides the energy for producing the other products. The  gas amounts to ~48 percent of the energy in dry wood (Raveendran and Ganesh  1996). The bio-oil is the liquid phase product and fast pyrolysis will produce more  than 120 gallons per dry ton of biomass (Mohan and others 2006). We determined  the value of bio-oil by comparing it to substitute market products. Bio-oil is  discounted by 60 percent in this analysis to account for the lower heating value  relative to the petroleum products. Minor furnace or boiler modifications are also  Table 1—Value of pyrolysis products from one air dry ton of biomass.  1. Syngas (fuel for Pyrolysis)  2.

This comparison gives a  value of $64 - $78 of bio-oil produced per dry ton of biomass. The third product  of pyrolysis is the solid bio-char and it is similarly valued by substitute market  products. Bio-char can be sold for horticulture or barbeque charcoal at a value  of ~$65 of bio-char per dry ton of biomass. Although bio-char does have this  wholesale market, the real benefit of the bio-char produced from forest biomass  using a portable pyrolyis unit might be in leaving it on the site from where the  biomass was extracted and using it for soil conditioning and carbon sequestra-tion.  As with biomass, the bio-char is a low-density, bulky material (0.35 specific  gravity, (Antal and Gronli 2003)) and transport cost may overcome the value and  favor leaving it on site. Carbon sequestration might provide a value of $9 and $18  per air dry ton. If ten air dry tons of biomass can be removed from an acre, the  potential market value of bio-oil plus bio-char might result in revenue of $730 to  $1430 per acre. In comparison to the median cost of biomass removal of $625 per  acre (Evans 2008), there appears to be a reasonable potential for profit considering  production, relocation, and transport costs must still be accounted.  One of the key features of the mobile pyrolysis approach is the ability to  take the conversion unit to the biomass source and avoid biomass transport.  In-woods pyrolysis operations allows us to convert biomass into an energy rich  high-density bio oil. Transporting a value-added high-density product not only  decreases transportation costs, but also decreases fossil fuel emissions required  for transport. Therefore, life-cycle analysis is another aspect of the portable vs.  centralized pyrolysis plant for which accounting should occur.  The capital and operating costs of small scale conversion units are high rela-tive  to larger units (Bridgwater 2004). Greater efficiencies are created by using  higher capacity pre-processing and handling equipment: relatively fewer person-nel  requirements, lower maintenance and greater operating hours per year. For  instance, moving the mobile pyrolysis unit into the woods, conducting startup  procedures, consuming available biomass, shutting down and relocating may  have a significant impact on operating efficiency. It is likely that the portable  pyrolysis unit will be located at a single central location within one or more project  area(s) and operated at that one location for considerable time, requiring minimal  transport of biomass, but still incurring some short-distance biomass transport  costs. Consequently, mobile pyrolysis units have both the advantage of limiting  transport distance over that of the centralized fixed-location conversion facility  and the disadvantage of having greater capital, operating, and relocation costs.  Our research is evaluating these operational and economic tradeoffs.  Figure 1 demonstrates the hypothetical operating range of mobile pyrolysis  units within the Umpqua and Willamette National Forest woodshed. Biomass  from the Umpqua would otherwise be transported to a centralized plant located in  Roseberg, OR. The central plant draws from a broader region beyond the indicated  National Forests, including surrounding Bureau of Land Management ground as  well as other public and private lands in and beyond the area illustrated. Travel  routes affect the efficiency with which biomass can be moved to Roseburg and  road networks are being used to calculate transportation requirements. Operational  efficiency of fixed and mobile pyrolysis units is being evaluated. Capital costs  and operational requirements of fixed location units are known through com-mercial  applications (Bridgwater 2004) and are being compared to information  from development-stage mobile units.  164 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-61. 2010.  Coleman, Page-Dumroese, Archuleta, Badger, Chung, Venn, Loeffler, Jones and McElligott Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using…  Bio-Char Advantage  The bio-char produced through these mobile units is equivalent to charcoal  that is manufactured for numerous other purposes through traditional and modern  pyrolysis techniques. Charcoal manufacture has been used throughout human  history including fuel for iron and bronze metallurgy starting 4,000 years ago  and lasting until the use of fossil fuel became widespread during the 19th century  (Rackham 1980). Modern charcoal uses include air and water filtration, cooking  charcoal, horticultural media, bioremediation, medicinal purposes, among others.  As an equivalent to charcoal, bio-char is also an artificially produced analog to  charcoal found in many fire ecosystems. This black carbon has been defined as  a natural component of fire ecosystems that lends favorable properties to soils  and enhances soil productivity (DeLuca and others 2008; Pietikainen and others  2000; Zackrisson and others 1996). Therefore, it can be applied to native eco-systems  without concerns of contamination. Bio-char presents an opportunity to  return nutrients removed in the biomass from project locations, and as mentioned  above, reapplication of bio-char to project sites also has potential value in carbon  Figure 1—Map of biomass supply area with circles representing portable pyrolyzer  supply areas within the Willamette and Umpqua National Forests and a centralized  processing facility located in Roseburg, OR with a supply area extending beyond the  map area.

Both the nutrient return and carbon sequestration values of bio-char  reapplication to project sites may outweigh other potential uses. Segments  of the public are increasing demands for limits on forest product utilization from  public land, which may prompt requirements for nutrient conservation. Geopo-litical  decisions are expected to expand limits on carbon emissions and reward  carbon sequestration. On-site retention may be the best option in light of these  social pressures.  Charcoal also has important horticultural values and soil enhancement char-acteristics.  It can be used in greenhouses as a plant growth media. Figure 2  compares poplar trees growing in potting soil blends with increasing bio-char  proportions. Poplar was used as a bioassay because of its responsiveness to vari-able  growing conditions and sensitivity to soil growth media. In this case, each  is growing equally well regardless of the amount of char included. Bio-char can  be used as an effective soil media in the greenhouse and at forest sites because  of the favorable properties provided to the soil.  Bio-char contains the majority of nutrients found in biomass feedstock (Gaskin  and others 2008). Nutrients such as nitrogen and sulfur can be volatilized during  the pyrolysis process, but the bio-char produced may also contain significant  amounts of these nutrients. This means that the bio-char resulting from extracting  energy in bio-oil production can be returned to the site to replenish soil nutrient  stocks.  Returning the bio-char to the site can also enhance soil organic matter. Bio-char  is mainly carbon held in aromatic form, which results in it being inert when  added as an amendment. As a consequence, it quickly builds the recalcitrant soil  carbon fraction of soil. We know from research on wildfire occurrence and the  development of anthrosols that charcoal-derived carbon can remain in the soil  for hundreds to thousands of years (Agee 1996; Lehmann and Rondon 2006).  Enhancement of the soil organic matter pool with charcoal provides the numer-ous  benefits of other organic matter including large surface area for exchange of  water and nutrients; however bio-char also has other characteristics that create  additional soil improvements.  Figure 2—Poplar trees growing for 12 weeks in potting soil with  different proportions of bio-char. Each pot received 1.5 g slow release  fertilizer (18-6-12). Differences between treatment were not significant  (P = 0.63). Error bars are standard errors.  166 USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-61. 2010.  Coleman, Page-Dumroese, Archuleta, Badger, Chung, Venn, Loeffler, Jones and McElligott Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using…  Bio-char acts as a liming agent resulting in increased soil pH and nutrient  availability for a number of different soil types (Glaser and others 2002; Lehm-ann  and Rondon 2006). Soil liming results in pH increases of one-half to one pH  units. The liming of acidic soils decreases Al saturation, while increasing cation  exchange capacity and base saturation. These responses following bio-char ad-ditions  are common soils responses to lime additions (Tisdale and Nelson 1975)  indicating that the effects of bio-char are similar to those of other liming agents.  Nutrient availability may actually increase beyond the amount expected by cation  exchange sites due to soluble salts available in the char. Anion availability may  also increase suggesting that anion exchange may be enhanced by bio-char ad-ditions  to soils (Glaser and others 2002). Microbial biomass and diversity is also  known to increase with greater bio-char including more abundant mycorrhizal  associations and enhanced biological nitrogen fixation (Lehmann and Rondon  2006). Therefore, when bio-char is added to soil it “sweetens” the soil by raising  the pH, improving the fertility level through additions of nutrient ions commonly  associated with ash additions, and enhances symbiotic soil microbe populations.  Bio-char may also increase the water holding capacity of forest soils. This is  especially important on western soils where the growing season is determined by  the length of time into seasonal summer droughts where soil moisture remains  favorable to growth. It may become more important in other forest ecosystems  where extended summer drought can significantly decrease growth and the fre-quency  and amount of summer rain events are expected to decrease with predicted  climate change. Improved water holding capacity through char additions is most  commonly observed in coarse textured or sandy soils (Gaskin and others 2007;  Glaser and others 2002). Just as increased surface area improves water holding  capacity of ash deposits (Dahlgren and others 2004; McDaniel and Wilson 2007),  the impact of bio-char additions on moisture content may be due to increased  surface area relative to that found in coarse textured soils (Glaser and others 2002).  The residence time of bio-char in soils may be in excess of 1000 years making  it a potential tool for carbon sequestration. Bio-char consists of highly aromatic  organic material having carbon concentrations of 70 to 80 percent (Lehmann and  others 2006), and it is highly resistant to decay by common soil saprophytes. Evi-dence  for the residence time of bio-char comes from several lines of research. Fire  ecology typically makes use of the long residence times of bio-char in dating fire  events through the latest interglacial period (Agee 1996). Archeologists similarly  have demonstrated the use of coppiced woodlands for prehistoric metallurgy by  dating the charcoal remains of historic operations back some four millennium  (Rackham 1980). Furthermore, the rich Terra Preta soils produced through char-coal  additions by a poorly understood Amazonian society occur in a matrix of  highly weathered tropical Oxisols (Mann 2008). These soils were developed over  2000 years ago as the agricultural basis of this sophisticated society and are still  regarded today as high quality top-soils with charcoal as the vital component  (Glaser and others 2001).  The potential to sequester carbon by char additions to soils creates an important  possibility to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This idea is not new (Seifritz  1993), but has recently gained interest with greater public awareness of the effect  of greenhouse gas emissions on climate. The portable pyrolysis units at scattered  locations throughout the forest may create greater opportunity to sequester carbon  than pyrolysis conversion at a centralized plant. For large fixed-location pyrolysis  plants, the economic incentive to return bio-char back to the woods is low because  of high transport costs and alternative uses for filtration, clean energy, cooking,  horticulture, etc. Furthermore, biomass moved from the woods is just as likely  to be used by any number of other processes in addition to pyrolysis including  fueling industrial boilers where char would not be a significant byproduct. From  USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-61. 2010. 167  Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using… Coleman, Page-Dumroese, Archuleta, Badger, Chung, Venn, Loeffler, Jones and McElligott  a forest management perspective, the preferred use for bio-char may not be for  transport to alternative use markets, but as an on-site soil amendment. Bio-char  reapplication represents the middle ground that might make biomass utilization  a reality.  Conclusion  The portable pyrolysis system offers a solution to biomass accumulation in  forest ecosystems. By utilizing the abundant forest biomass that is annually  produced through forest harvest residues and hazard fuel reduction projects it  may be possible to produce a liquid fuel that will reduce dependence on foreign  energy sources. If biomass conversion can occur in the woods it will improve the  economic and environmental impact of biomass utilization for energy produc-tion.  In addition, the bio-char byproduct can be redistributed to the site of energy  extraction and thereby return nutrients to the site to maintain site quality. The  additional properties of char additions, including liming, microbial enhancement  and improved water holding capacity, create the opportunity to maintain or im-prove  soil quality. Furthermore, bio-char’s recalcitrance can sequester carbon for  centuries. Such an approach is advocated for agricultural systems (Laird 2008;  Lehmann and others 2006), but the arguments are even stronger for portable  pyrolysis units used in forestry systems where long distances make onsite reap-plication  a better option than long-distance transport of biomass to and return of  char from a centralized processing facility.

"Bioenergy Production Systems and Biochar Application in Forests: Potential for Renewable Energy, Soil Enhancement, and Carbon Sequestration","McElligott, K.M.; Page-Dumroese, D.; Coleman, M.","Bioenergy production from forest biomass offers a unique solution to reduce wildfire hazard fuel while producing a useful source of renewable energy. However, biomass removals raise concerns about reducing soil carbon and altering forest site productivity. Biochar additions have been suggested as a way to mitigate soil carbon loss and cycle nutrients back into forestry sites; yet, little is known about the effects of intentional biochar amendments to temperate forest soil in conjunction with biomass removals for bioenergy production. In this review, we evaluate the potential for mobile bioenergy systems and the environmental implications of biochar application in forests. Using forest biomass that accumulates annually during forest harvest operations, bioenergy can be produced on-site and the biochar that is generated can be redistributed to return nutrients and help improve water holding capacity of the site. Little is known about the short- and long-term impacts of biochar application in forest ecosystems. Some sites may benefit from biochar application, while others show no or negative responses. Field studies on soil and vegetation responses combined with laboratory studies will elucidate the best sites for biochar application and sustainable bioenergy production.",2011-10-01,yes,research (document genres); fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber);,"Bioenergy Productions Systems and Biochar Application in Forests: Potential for Renewable Energy, Soil Enhancement, and Carbon Sequestration.

However, readily available biomass models are regional and thus potentially mask nutritional affects of site-type. Site nutrient richness may influence Douglas-fir allometric relationships and could affect the nutrient content of tree components. To test this, we selected mature stands of consistent climate regime that were deemed either poor site nutrition (quartzite parent material, 3 sites) or good site nutrition (basalt parent material, 3 sites). This comparison will help define when and where generalized or site-specific biomass models.  NARATIVE  Rationale and Justification: Many of the biomass models developed for tree species of the Intermountain West were initiated several decades ago during the last energy crisis (Brown, 1978; Gholz et al., 1979; Cochrane et al., 1984). These models were developed from regionally based on allometric relationships (e.g. diameter at breast height – DBH, total tree height) and tree biomass as measured by mass of foliage, stemwood, branchwood, and bark. The creation of regional, species-specific allometric equations enabled estimation of forest biomass across broad geographic landscapes without the need for destructive sampling. However, the very nature of these regional models introduces a scaling error into biomass estimations and raises the question: Does a regional biomass model accurately predict, within an acceptable level of error, biomass at the site level? Many of the regional biomass models were created by destructively sampling trees across a wide range of site productivity conditions which mask the affect of site-specific attributes on forest productivity (Brown, 1978; Gholz et al., 1979; Cochrane et al., 1984).  Site productivity as it relates to native soil fertility, parent material, and moisture regime, has a direct effect on biomass production (Shen et al., 2000). Few, if any, of these regional biomass equations allow model adjustment for site specific variables such as soil nutrient or moisture status (Ter-Mikaelian and Korzukhin, 1997). Comparisons between generalized and site-specific biomass models for Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii in southern British Columbia found that site nutrient status and geographic location significantly influenced biomass model parameters, especially on sites with low site productivity (Feller, 1992). Monserud and Marshall (1999) found that site-specific, tree crown biomass models for three northern Idaho conifer species showed strong differences in biomass estimates compared to other Intermountain West biomass models. Consequently, we suspect that accounting for site-specific moisture and nutrient status in total tree biomass models will improve biomass estimates within Intermountain West forests.  Objectives: This research will test the hypotheses that 1) generalized biomass models for Psuedotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca significantly differ from measured, site-specific tree biomass, and 2) site-specific biomass models significantly improve biomass estimates of Psuedotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca over existing regional models. Results from these tests will be used to 1) improve biomass estimates for use in regional forest bioenergy research, 2) suggest modifications to the biomass estimator function within the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) as developed by the United States Forest Service, and 3) develop protocols for creating multi-species, site-specific biomass models across the Intermountain West.  Procedures: A matrix of potential research sites will be created by stratifying forested landscapes of the Inland Northwest by soil temperature and moisture regimes and geologic formations derived by digital surveys of the Natural Resource Conservation Service and the United States Geological Survey. The initial phase of this project will select 4-6 sites that support near rotation age forest structures and fall within the Xeric-Frigid soil regime. Within the Xeric-Frigid regime, 2-3 sites will be selected that reflect poor site nutrition (quartzite) and 2-3 sites that reflect better relative soil nutrition (basalt).  A pre-harvest forest inventory will be conducted on each research site to collect mensurational and physiology data for use in sample size/selection development and model parameter selection (Avery and Burkhart, 2002; Brown, 1978; Monserud and Marshall, 1999). From each site inventory, a stratified sample of 3-5 DBH size classes will be determined for destructive sampling. Three random trees within each size class will be felled, measured, cut to 10ft sections, and de-limbed. Biomass weights will be collected for the following categories: i) foliage, ii) live branches, iii) dead branches, iv) stemwood, and v) bark. Each category will be weighed in the field for green weight and then a subsample identified for lab analysis of dry weight and wood density.  Field and laboratory measures of each biomass category will be compared against regional biomass models. Model error will be computed to determine generalized model estimates of an acceptable error. Site specific biomass equations will be developed using mensurational, physiology, and site status data. Site-specific biomass estimates will be compared to generalized biomass estimates and the utility of the models assessed.  REFERENCESAvery, T.E., and H.E. Burkhart. 2002. Forest measurements. 5th ed.

Site Preparation Effects on Volcanic Ash Forest Soils and Douglas-fir Regeneration,"Kimsey, M.; Roche, D.","Physical and chemical soil characteristics along with Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii var. glauca) growth and foliar nutrition were tracked over a 24 yr period following a ground based regeneration harvest and site preparation in northern Idaho, USA. Harvest unit soils were classified as Andisols overlaying metasedimentary parent material within an udic-frigid moisture and temperature regime. Douglas-fir site index at base age 50 was 29 m. Four site preparation conditions were monitored: undisturbed control, broadcast burn, pile and burn, and mechanical scarification. Periodic soil-site measurements were collected on each condition at regeneration stand ages 6, 14 and 24 yrs. Six and 14-yr soil bulk density on scarified conditions were significantly higher at 0-15 and 15-30 cm than all other conditions. Scarified soil bulk density showed recovery to non-scarify condition levels at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm after 24 yrs. Scarified soil organic matter (SOM) and N were significantly reduced by 32 and 42% over control levels 6 yrs post-harvest. After 24 yrs, scarified SOM and N were significantly lower than that found in broadcast burn (44 and 54%) and pile and burn (33% and 49%). Douglas-fir needle mass and foliar N and P content on scarified conditions were significantly lower than broadcast burn or pile and burn conditions after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). Soil and foliar N content was significantly higher in those conditions receiving a burn application after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). Tree growth on either burn condition showed significantly greater diameter (35%), height (14%) and volume (92%) when compared to trees growing on scarified conditions after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). These results indicate that tree growth on frigid, ash-mantled forest soils of the Inland Northwest can be significantly reduced following soil compaction and displacement of organic-rich topsoil. Where soil disturbance is minimized and organic matter retention is coupled with a burn treatment, soil and tree productivity will be maintained or enhanced.",2012,yes,research (document genres); soil science; statistics;,"Kimsey, M., D.

Introduction   Forest fertilization may be an effective treatment to   increase or maintain multiple resource outputs on a   land base that is declining because of urbanization and   government regulation. Most forests in the inland   Northwest are nutrient deficient and overstory conifers   respond with increases in growth (Shaffii et al., 1989;   Moore et al., 1991; Garrison et al., 2000) and changes   in nutrient concentrations following fertilization   (Garrison et al., 2000). However, information regard-ing   fertilization effects on understory vegetation nutri-ent   concentrations in the inland Northwest is minimal.   Nutrient concentration and contents for individual   species differs from biomass because species with a   low number of plants or a low amount of biomass can   still have a large impact on the ecosystem. Different   understory species uptake varying amounts of indivi-dual   nutrients (Tappeiner and Alm, 1975; Grime,   1977; Turner et al., 1978; Chapin et al., 1986; Meerts,   1997).

Ash Cap Influences on Site Productivity and Fertilizer Response in Forests of the Inland Northwest,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Mika, P.G.; Miller, D.L.; Cannon, P.; Johnson, L.R.","Data from 139 research sites throughout the Inland Northwest were analyzed for effects of ash cap on site productivity, nutrient availability and fertilization response. Stand productivity and nitrogen (N) fertilizer response were greater on sites with ash cap than on sites without. Where ash was present, depth of ash had no effect on site productivity or N fertilizer response. Site productivity increased with increasing potentially available soil water. Potentially available soil water, in turn, increased with increasing ash depth. Decreasing availability of magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) in the upper 12 inches of soil may have constrained site productivity with increasing ash depth. Soil mineralizable N and ammonium N were unaffected by ash presence or depth but did vary by underlying parent material. Site productivity and N fertilizer response varied by underlying parent material even after accounting for ash presence. Stand volume response to sulfur (S) fertilization decreased with increasing ash depth, suggesting possible S adsorption by ash cap.

Introduction by Dr. John H, Ehrenreich: Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center at the Univeristy of Idaho. The lecture covers the Senator's perspective of his election in 1962 and how his campaign was linked to the Wilderness Bill. It then covers the following years and how the Wilderness Act was put into action by various branches of the government  and how continued action needed to be made by congress. The lecture also touches on how other lands can be managed better to make up for the loss of the lands deemed 'Wilderness'. Lastly the lecture reviews various interpretations of the Wilderness Act and how use of the land deemed 'Wilderness' is being too restricted by certain government orginizations.

WILDERNESS RESOURCE  DISTINGUISHED LECTURESHIP  WILDERNESS  IN A BALANCED  LAND USE  FRAMEWORK  1  Frank Church  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO WILDERNESS RESEARCH CENTER  March 21, 1977  Published in cooperation with the Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station  as Contribution No. 69.  Dean's Introduction  Enk Church is a native Idahoan, raised in Boise,  and the son of pioneer stock. After decorated military service  in World War II, he attended Stanford University Law  School, graduating with honors. He practiced law in Boise  until 1956, when, at the age of 32, he was elected to the  U.S. Senate; he was re-elected in 1962, 1968, and 1974.  Today, Frank Church is truly a d isti ngu ished national leader  in the affairs of this country.  Senator Church is widely known and acclaimed for  many things: his work in international affairs; his leader­ship  in opposition to the war in Vietnam and to concentra­tion  of power in the presidency; his pursuit of governmental  reform through re-establishment of constitutional principles  and open government at all levels; his untiring efforts for  the elderly, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging;  his strong stands against undue Federal regulation and  impacts on American life, be it gun control or taxes inflated  by lack of economy in government.  But it is not these accomplishments that bring  Senator Church to us tonight as the first speaker in the  University of Idaho's Wilderness Resource Distinguished  Lectureship series. It is his equally impressive national  leadership in environmental protection and resource manage­ment  affairs. Let me cite some of his accomplishments in  these fields.  He was floor manager of the controversial wilderness  bill that passed the Senate in 1961 and 1963 and was  signed into law in 1964, after 8 years of conflict and com­promise.  He also floor managed legislation establishing  the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1968. He authored  the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. These are impres­sive  en vi ron mental protection achievements, but they don't  overshadow his efforts on behalf of balanced resource man­agement  and use. As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee  on . Public Lands, he led the development of clearcutting  guidelines to control abuses and successfully postponed a  threatened clearcutting ban that would have had severe  impact on industries and economies dependent on working  forests. In the last Congress, these same ""Church clearcutting  guidelines"" were incorporated into the new National Forest  Management Act of 1976, along with a Church-sponsored  amendment to provide annual funding for reforestation and  timber stand improvement to reduce the sizeable backlog of  poorly stocked forest lands. Less publicized but also impor­tant  are the Senator's continuing efforts to provide justified  funding for Federal management programs to insure full  multiple use benefits from public lands.  Here in Idaho we are particularly blessed as the benefi­ciaries  of Senator Church's efforts for environmental protec­tion.  To balance our working natural resou-rces and support  an important and growing outdoor recreation and tourist  industry, we have  - the Sawtooth and Hells Cany~n National Recreation  Areas;  - the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and the Middle  Fork of the Clearwater River, with its Selway and  ii  Lochsa tributaries, protected as Wild and Scenic  Rivers;  -the Bruneau, Moyie, Priest, and Saint Joe Rivers  and the Main Fork of the Salmon River designated  for study by 1978 as potential additions to the  Wild and Scenic Rivers system;  - the Sawtooth and Selway-Bitterroot Wildernesses;  -and currently, the Idaho and Salmon River Breaks  Primitive Areas proposed for reclassification as a  great Central Idaho Wilderness.  In his lecture tonight, Senator Church will address a  controversial topic of national significance- and one that  sparks considerable interest here in Idaho- the National  Wilderness Preservation System. The Senator's legislative  efforts attest to his belief in the role of wilderness as part  of a balanced spectrum of land uses, and his remarks include  a number of suggestions for securing such a balance through  appropriate wilderness allocation and management.  Senator Church, we look forward to your presentation.  Dr. john H. Ehrenreich is Dean, College of Forestry,  Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director, Wilderness  Research Center, University of Idaho.  iii  WILDERNESS IN A  BALANCED LAND USE  FRAMEWORK  Frank Church  Lank you for asking me to be the first speaker in  your annual Wilderness Resource Distinguished Lectureship  series. The College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences  and the Wilderness Research Center are to be congratulated  for establishing this new series. I hope it will contribute to  balanced land and resource management.  The chance to speak here on ""Wilderness in a Balanced  Land Use Framework"" is a treat for me. That subject has  claimed a good deal of my time during 20 years in the  Senate. And, being from Idaho, I have had more opportunity  than most to savor wilderness.  The Early Controversy  Passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964 marked the  beginning of a legislative effort to preserve certain Federal  lands in their natural state. The act was preceded by 8 years  of lively debate in Congress, in the press, and in public  hearings throughout the country. Congress finally passed the  legislation after 65 separate b i lis had been introduced. In  the end, it was the public interest to be served by a wilder­ness  system which overcame the vested interests arrayed  against it. Still, it was never sufficiently understood at the  time that the bill formed only part of a larger equation:  by designating some lands as wilderness, it followed that  more intensive use should be made of other lands, such as  our working forests.  If any Senator were to be singled out, it is Hubert  Humphrey who deserves the credit for being the father of  the National Wilderness Preservation System. He introduced  the first wilderness bill. However, by the time the legislation  reached the Senate floor in 1961, its principal sponsor and  advocate was Clinton P. Anderson of New Mexico, then  serving as chairman of the Senate Interior Committee. U n­fortunately,  Senator Anderson was taken ill and had to be  hospitalized just before the bill was called up for debate.  At his request, I filled in as floor manager of the legislation.  Because the bill engendered a heated controversy in  Idaho and elsewhere in the West, it was considered a heavy  political cross to bear. In 1962, when I ran for re-election,  the newspapers in Idaho were filled with references to the  ""Church Wilderness Bill,"" which was not intended as a com­pliment  and gave me more credit than I deserved.  It was apparent that my opponents were determined to  make wilderness the major issue of the campaign. No other  politician in either party stood with me, and, as the election  approached, most of them joined in a chorus of calamity  over the awful fate in store for Idaho, should the Senate­passed  bill become law.  Looking back, I still have vivid memories of that bitter  campaign. I recall meetings where the mood of the crowd  2  made me wonder if a hanging were planned, with the noose  intended for my neck! Wild-eyed descriptions of the Wilder­ness  Bill had spread anger and alarm throughout the moun­tain  communities. But Idahoans are fair minded, even when  aroused, and they were willing to hear me out. They pepper­ed  me with questions:  ""Senator, why are you in favor of converting our  western forests into wilderness playgrounds for eastern  m iII ionai res?""  I replied that I thought the wilderness areas in Idaho  would be used principally by our own citizens, a prediction  since borne out by Forest Service statistics. 1  ""But, Senator, only the wealthy can afford to hire  guides and packstrings. What about us ordinary folks?""  This argument, widely circulated and surprisingly  believed, was enough to blow the mind. Most people hike  into the wilderness, with packs on their backs and their  children in string. A few years ago, in the summer of 1973,  I spent a week in the Sawtooth Wilderness. We were the  only party with horses. But we encountered many other  wilderness visitors: college students and mountain climbers  in small groups, older backpackers and fishermen, and  hardy parents and their kids. That's not exactly the chic  clientele you find at Sun Valley! Around the campfires, I  remember the conversations well. One young father, lean­ing  back to glimpse the treetops and the arching star­studded  sky, put it this way: ""What an irony! No amount  of money could buy what is given us free tonight. No king  could purchase these splendors. This is the best vacation  we could possibly have as a family. And, you know, it  happens to be the only kind I can afford!""  3  Well, enough of rhapsody. Let's return to the grim  inquisition of the 1962 Senatorial campaign. A familiar  statement was,  ""That's not the point, Senator. Maybe some just plain  people do enjoy the wilderness. Still, they're not the  majority. Most of us want to drive through the woods and  find places to park our campers. The great outdoors is OK,  but we like a little comfort, too.""  ""Well, fine,"" I would reply. ""We're spending a fortune  building forest highways, developing campgrounds, marinas,  and other recreational facilities. By the time we are done,  90 percent of our public lands will be accessible to the  majority who want to take their vacations on wheels. But  what about the people who don't? Are we to leave nothing  for them, no escape from the pavement, the crowds, the  billboards, the costly resorts? This country is big enough to  leave some of its land alone, as a sanctuary for those who,  from time to time, feel the need to get away from it all.  Otherwise, we'll turn this country into a cage!""  Still, in the autumn of 1962, it was not possible to  debate the wilderness issue solely on its merits. Too many  people who depended on the public domain for their live­lihood  were afraid that the wilderness concept, once im­bedded  in the law, would spread and spread, until their  jobs were threatened. They forecast a time when our  resource-based industries- timber, cattle and sheep grazing,  mining, and water development for power and irrigation -  would all be constrained by the expanding wilderness system.  That was the rub which no amount of argument could dispel.  So, looking back, it was hardly surprising that the user  groups should have combined against me on the wilderness  issue. The night before the election, my chances looked  bleak. My father-in-law, the late Chase Clark, paced back and  4  •  forth in our living room at home in Boise. He was then  Federal District Judge, but he had formerly served as  Governor of Idaho, as Mayor of Idaho Falls, and had held  membership in both houses of the State Legislature. As  well as any man, he knew that the user groups had histori­cally  dominated Idaho politics.  ""Tell me, Frank,"" he asked, ""how do you expect to  win? All the organizations that count are against you: the  cattlemen, the woolgrowers, the mining association, the  forest products industry, the newspapers, the chambers of  commerce ... and for what? For wilderness! You don't  just have rocks on your mind; you've got rocks in your  head!""  Well, he hadn't exhausted the list. The doctors and  dentists were also against me- but that was on account of  Medicare.  The Judge's case was pretty persuasive that night.  All I could say was, ""Pop, maybe I 'II be lucky like Harry  Truman. Remember 1948? Everybody was against Harry  Truman, everybody but the people.""  The next day I won the election. A corner had been  turned. Despite the raging editorials, the united efforts of  the user groups, the scare talk, a majority of the people  wanted a part of our fast-vanishing wilderness saved. They  knew this was the right thing to do, if the good life they  had enjoyed was to be preserved -for themselves and  for their children. The campaign had been a classic case of  the West divided against itself, and the issue was decided  in accordance with the best insti nets of the voters.  Valid as the verdict favoring wilderness was then­and  is now - the fears of those who opposed the Wilder­ness  Bill in 1962 have not proved to be unfounded. The  5  concept of an expanding wilderness has extended far beyond  the limits of the original bill. To understand how it happen­ed  and what it may imply for the future calls for a brief  review of our recent his tory.  The Growth of the Wilderness Concept  As finally enacted into law in 1964, the original  Wilderness Act created 54 ""instant"" wilderness areas  totaling 9.1 million acres. In addition, the 34 existing  primitive areas in our national forests were to be reviewed  and their boundaries redrawn, with the objective of then  admitting them, one by one, into the wilderness system.  The roadless land within the national parks and wildlife  refuges was also to be reviewed, and tracts found appropriate  were to be recommended to Congress for inclusion. Alto­gether,  a wilderness system of 40 to 50 mill ion acres was  anticipated.  Since then, despite growing pressures for more wilder­ness,  Congress has acted with restraint. In 1975, the Eastern  Wilderness Act was approved. It designated 16 national  forest areas- some 207,000 acres- as wilderness, and  directed a study of 17 other areas- an additional 125,000  acres. Considering the urgent need for wilderness in the  densely populated regions of the East, this was hardly a  runaway program.  Then came the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  Organic Act last year. It requires a study of BLM's 13 primi­tive  and natural areas, encompassing 307,000 acres, for  possible wilderness classification, and within the next  15 years an inventory of all the 90 million acres of roadless  lands within the vast domain of the BLM,2 looking toward  the selection of new wilderness study areas. Since most of  6  this land is arid or semi-arid, no serious impact on existing  uses should be entailed.  Since 1964, however, unanticipated court decisions  have greatly confused the picture. The East Meadow  Creek decision, upheld by the Supreme Court in 1972,  decreed that no roadless area next to a national forest  primitive area may be developed prior to a Congressional  decision on whether or not to incorporate the area in the  National Wilderness Preservation System. Following this  decision, the Forest Service conducted a far-reaching re­view,  identified 1449 roadless areas 5000 acres or larger  -a total of 56 million acres- and selected 274 of them,  12.3 million acres, as new wilderness study areas. Further­more,  the Chief of the Forest Service ordered that agency  plans for any of the road less areas not selected for wilder­ness  study-44 million acres- must still consider wilderness  as one possible use. Furthermore, environmental impact  statements would have to be prepared for each planning  unit.  All these events have increased the potential size of  the wilderness system from the 40 to 50 million acres  originally contemplated by Congress to something much  larger. Today, 14.4 m iII ion acres are in the system. Ex­cluding  proposals under the Alaska Native Claims Settle­ment  Act, nearly 25 million acres are pending action by  Congress; another 24 million acres have been committed  to wilderness study by either Congress or the agencies;  while nearly 150 million acres of roadless lands remain  with opportunities for wilderness as well as other uses.  These are agency estimates; environmentalists claim an  even greater acreage.3  All this presents us with serious questions about the  future use of at least 150 million acres of roadless land that  7  may also be of value for logging, mining, or other multiple  use applications. What part of this should be wilderness?  What part should be managed for other purposes?  There are no easy answers tv these questions. Exper­ience  proves that. However, there are a number of things  which can help us make the hard decisions.  Congressional Strategy for Wilderness Classification  Congress must begin to do some long-range thinking  about the ultimate size and location of the wilderness system.  The current practice of area-by-area classification obscures  the need for a comprehensive view of the national system we  intend to build. Omnibus bills to incorporate a number of  areas at once are obviously necessary. This is the purpose of  the Endangered American Wilderness Bill I will introduce in  the Senate within the next week or two.4 By speeding up the  incorporation of areas for which there is widespread agree­ment,  the study of remaining areas can be expedited and  the needed decisions sooner made.5  Meanwhile, we should move ahead with the backlog of  proposals now pending before Congress. For example, here  in our own state, the Idaho Primitive Area and the Salmon  River Breaks Primitive Area have still to be reclassified as  wilderness. That's a high priority on my list for this session.  This region is the largest roadless tract left in the United  States, south of Alaska. It will constitute a wilderness of  immense attraction and significance.  In addition to the workload now facing us, Congress  must also oversee the ongoing management and classification  plans. Congress is not properly representing the people if  concerned citizens can't turn to us and say, ((We think the  agency is mistaken in proposing to develop- or not to  develop - this or that area. Come take a look."" 6  8  But in carrying such appeals to Congress, I would hope  that the various interest groups would strive to present  broadly balanced and well-reasoned arguments. For example,  proponents of wilderness sometimes appear to be more  concerned about obtaining the maximum size than they  are about the true wilderness quality of an area. At the same  time, some timber interests are more concerned with total  allowable cut reductions than with actual use of the timber  in the proposed area. Mining interests seem of the opinion  that nothing should ever restrict exploration or mining  anywhere - even if the potential of the survey is minimal.  Most of the 11 7 5 Forest Service road less areas not  selected for wilderness study- and perhaps many of the  BLM tracts yet to be inventoried- will be better suited for  other uses. Our goal should be to see that endangered and  deserving areas move more swiftly into wilderness designa­tion  and, equally important, that areas better suited for  resource development are scheduled for such use with all  deliberate speed, thus reducing the uncertainty now facing  our resource-dependent indus tries.  Wilderness Related to Better Use of Other Lands  It is not possible to resolve wilderness issues in a  vacuum. For example, a relatively small amount of the  nation's timber supply is tied up in potential wilderness.  A loss of this timber to wilderness could be made up easily  through more inten~ive management of our working forests.  Better methods of reforestation, thinning, fertilization,  control of fire, insects and disease, and improvements in the  genetic makeup of seedlings could all help boost the annual  harvest, as could improved timber utilization, logging  methods and planning. Elsewhere, incentive programs might  spur fiber production on small, privately owned woodlots.  Wilderness advocates should -and they often do- recognize  9  that it's in their best interests to see multiple use manage­ment  improved. The ultimate size of the wilderness system  may well depend on increasing production levels from our  other lands.  I'm reminded here that, back in the early 70s follow­ing  debates on the proposed Timber Supply Act, an ad hoc  committee of conservationists and lumber industry represen­tatives  was convened by the American Forestry Association.  Its purpose was to identify ""areas of agreement."" The con­cept  is a good one because it puts diverse groups to work,  side by side, searching for consensus on matters they do  agree upon. And, in addition, by helping build a common  effort to get more from our forests- both wood and wilder­ness-  it helps reduce the polarization that so often bogs  us down in resource matters.  So, as I work for wilderness, I work also for more  efficient forest management across the board.l I urge  sportsmen, conservationists, and environmentalists to help.  Because the only way we can fashion an adequate wilder­ness  system is as part of a well-balanced resource manage­ment  program for the entire country.  The Purity Issue  My final comments tonight concern the issue of wilder­ness  purity. Time after time, when we discuss wilderness,  questions are raised about how developed an area can be and  still qualify as wilderness, or what kinds of activities within  a wilderness area are consistent with the purposes of the  Wilderness Act. I believe, and many citizens agree with me,  that the agencies are applying provisions of the Wilderness  Act too strictly and thus misconstruing the intent of  Congress as to how these areas should be managed.  10  One of my long-time friends, Ted Trueblood, challenged  the purity doctrine of the Forest Service in the September  1975 issue of Field & Stream. 8 As Ted put it, the Forest  Service with its purist doctrine is trying to scuttle the Wilder­ness  Act. In arguing the case, Ted refers to requirements  which make outfitter operations difficult, to fish and wild­life  management activities which limit the enjoyment of  hunters and fishermen, to the exclusion of deserving Idaho  areas from wilderness classification because they contain  minor evidence of man's prior activities, and perhaps most  tragic of all, to the burning of historic cabins to eliminate  the evidence of earlier human habitation.  Such policies are misguided. If Congress had intended  that wilderness be administered in so stringent a manner,  we would never have written the law as we did. We wouldn't  have provided for the possibility of insect, disease and fire  control. We wouldn't have allowed private inholdings to  remain. We wouldn't have excluded condemnation as the  means for forcibly acquiring developed ranches within  wilderness areas- a practice allowed on ordinary national  forest lands from which wilderness is created. We wouldn't  have made wilderness classification subject to existing pri­vate  rights such as mining and grazing. We wouldn't have  provided for the continuation of nonconforming uses where  they were established- including the use of motor boats in  part of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and the use of air­fields  in the primitive areas here in Idaho. As these examples  clearly demonstrate, it was not the intent of Congress that  wilderness be administered in so pure a fashion as to need­lessly  restrict its customary public use and enjoyment.  Quite the contrary, Congress fully intended that wilderness  should be managed to allow its use by a wide spectrum of  Americans.  11  There is need for a rule of reason in interpreting the  act, of course, because wilderness values are to be protected.  As I stated in 1972 while chairing a hearing of the Sub­committee  on Public Lands:  ... The Wilderness Act was not deliber­ately  contrived to hamstring reasonable  and necessary management activities.  We intend to permit the managing  agencies . .. latitude ... where the pur­pose  is to protect the wilderness, its  resources and the public visitors within  the area . .. [including, for example j  minimum sanitation facilities . .. fire  protection necessities ... [and j the  development of potable water supplies .  . . . The issue is not whether necessary  management facilities are prohibited;  they are not. The test is whether they  are necessary. 9  Thus, the wilderness management framework intended  by Congress was that the agencies do only what is necessary.  The facilities just mentioned may be required -and restric­tions  on use may sometimes be needed to protect especially  fragile locations. But in adopting regulations, common  sense is required. For example, I can understand the Forest  Service urging outfitters and guides to make their camps  conform to the spirit of a wilderness experience for their  clients; but it seems insane to allow wooden tent floors in  their camps, only to require them to be packed out of the  area each fall before they disappear below the snow and  then carried back in again after the spring thaw!  12  In summary, if purity is to be an issue in the manage­ment  of wilderness, let it focus on preserving the natural  integrity of the wilderness environment- and not on need­less  restriction of facilities necessary to protect the area  while providing for human use and enjoyment.  Summary and Conclusions  We often embark on a journey looking for one thing  and discover something else. Columbus and other explorers  of his time were looking for the East Indies and discovered  two continents they did not know existed. The search begun  by Aldo Leopold, Bob Marshall and others earlier in this  century for a system to protect some of America's wilder­ness  remnants led eventually to a heightened concern for  our natural environment. Yes, the wilderness movement  was the forerunner of the environmental movement. Through  our concern for these wild lands, we came to realize that it  is folly to extract and exploit resources without considering  the impact of these actions on the surrounding environment.  We have been forced to recognize that man cannot live well  in an empty open-pit copper mine, or on a falling water  table, an eroded farm, or a field of tree stumps.  Thus, the wilderness movement was not a romantic  excursion into the past; rather, it was the start of an explora­tion  of our future. We are learning, at times painfully slowly,  that all the components of the environment - both the  living plants and animals and the fossil fuels and minerals  which are the ir ancient relatives - are vital to our well-being.  I think the real meaning of wilderness was stated best  20 years ago by my late colleague from New Mexico, Senator  Clinton Anderson. He was not only chairman of the Senate  13  Interior Committee and a former Secretary of Agriculture,  but a hard-headed businessman to boot. He put it this way:  Wilderness is an anchor to windward.  Knowing it is there, we can also know  that we are still a rich nation, tending to  our resources as we should- not a  people in despair scratching every last  nook and cranny of our land for a board  of lumber, a barrel of oil, a blade of  grass, or a tank of water. 10  Today as we rise to the difficult challenge of designating  and managing wilderness, we must rise, too, to the challenge  of better stewardship of all our natural resources: the land,  the water, and the air. As we proceed on this journey to­gether,  the real meaning of wilderness will open our eyes  like an Idaho sunrise on a summer morning.  14  Notes  1 Two studies of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, by  the Forest Service in 1971 and by the University of Idaho's  Wilderness Research Center last summer, show that it's not  only wealthy people who use the wilderness, nor is it people  from far away. It is people representing all incomes, ages  and educations, and the vast majority of them I ive near  the area. Perhaps most important is the fact that so many of  them are students: nearly one-fourth in the 1971 study and  more than one-third last year in this Idaho-Montana wilder­ness.  2 The exact acreage of BLM roadless lands potentially  suitable for wilderness is uncertain until an inventory is  carried out. This estimate is documented in House of Repre­sentatives  Report 94-1163, May 15, 1976, pages 18 and 50.  3 See Table 1.  4 The Endangered American Wilderness Bill was intro­du~  ed in the Senate by Senator Church March 30, 1977.  See Congressional Record S5127-S5133, March 30, 1977.  5 On this point, see my ""Introductory Statement for  the Endangered American Wilderness Act,"" Congressional  Record 122 (1 03), June 29, 1976.  6 Recent laws and current proposals in Congress often  reflect that, after taking such a look, Congress has disagreed  15  with agency decisions and has upheld the intent of these  citizen requests.  PL 94-557, an omnibus Wilderness Act, added 16  wildlife refuge areas and 3 national forest areas to the  National Wilderness Preservation System. One of these latter  was a noninventoried roadless area and one a nonselected  road less area. Within national forest boundaries, the act also  designated 8 new wilderness study areas, 4 of which were  noninventoried, 2 and part of a third of which were non­selected  road less areas.  PL 94-567, an omnibus Wilderness Act, added 13  national park areas to the National Wilderness Preservation  System, revised boundaries of 3 existing wilderness areas,  and created 1 wilderness study area from Forest Service  noninventoried and nonselected roadless areas.  S 393, the Montana Wilderness Study Areas Bill, which  passed only the Senate in the 94th Congress, designated 10  new wilderness study areas on national forests. With the  exception of portions of 3 of them, the study areas were  nonselected road less areas. (See Senate Report 94-1 027.)  This bill has been reintroduced to the 95th Congress under  the same number.  S 3630, the proposed Endangered American Wilderness  Bill, introduced in the Senate late in the 94th Congress,  called for 9 ""instant"" wilderness areas and 6 wilderness  study areas, all or part of each of the 15 areas being Forest  Service noninventoried or nonselected roadless areas. A  nearly identical ""Endangered Bill"" was introduced in the  House by Congressman Udall (H 14524), but did not pass.  A revised version of H 14524 has been reintroduced in the  95th Congress as HR 3454.  S 1384, the Oregon Omnibus Wilderness Areas Bill,  called for ""instant"" wilderness classification of 14 areas,  4 of them Forest Service nonselected roadless areas. This  bill has been reintroduced to the 95th Congress but has  been revised to focus entirely on nonselected roadless areas.  7 While I have strongly supported wilderness and wild  river additions, I'm equally proud of my support for across­the-  board improvements in resource management- the  16  ""Church clearcutting guidelines'' in the recent National  Forest Management Act and my sponsored amendment to  that act to provide increased annual funding for reforesta­tion  and timber stand improvements.

Illustrations by Lorraine Ashland  Introduction  JOHN H. EHRENREICH  It gives me a great deal of pleasure to welcome you  this evening to the fifth in the annual series of Wilderness  Resource Distinguished Lectureships. Before I introduce our  distinguished speaker, I would like to give you some back­ground  on this series and why tonight's topic was chosen.  The Lectureships are an activity of the University of  Idaho's Wilderness Research Center, which is working to  create a better understanding of wilderness, its natural and  human-constructed elements, and the management systems  designed or being developed to protect these areas. The con­cept  of preserving and managing wilderness is relatively new  to society, and we have much to learn about designing and  developing these systems. The Wilderness Research Center  attempts to stimulate scientific studies in these areas and to  foster academic discussions on all subjects related to wilder­ness.  Previous Distinguished Lectureships have included:  Former Senator Frank Church, who discussed,  ""Wilderness in a Balanced Land Use Framework"";  Dr. Roderick Nash, historian and author of ""Wilder­ness  and the American Mind,"" who challenged us  to think whether there are contradictions inherent  in the wilderness concept, and how these might be  dealt with;  Former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus,  who gave us an insider's viewpoint on President  Carter's attempts to reorganize the federal resource  management agencies into a single Department of  Natural Resources;  And last year, Mr. Patrick Noonan of The Nature  Conservancy, who focused on efforts in the private  sector to protect wilderness and smaller, unique  natural areas for study and future enjoyment.  A topic that fits well into any consideration of wilder­ness  is the national park system. The National Park Service  was one of three major federal land management agencies  charged in The Wilderness Act of 1964 with reviewing its  land and identifying portions of it for wilderness designation.  More than 10,000,000 acres have been so designated in the  lower 48 states, and considerably more in Alaska. The  National Park Service has also been a leader in interpreting  wilderness to its visitors, and in developing management  approaches to its wilderness resources.  Tonight we are honored to have with us the Director of  the National Park Service, Mr. Russell E. Dickenson, who will  discuss the status of wilderness in America's National Parks.  Director Dickenson began his career in 1946 as a park  ranger in Grand Canyon National Park. He progressed to the  position of chief ranger and superintendent in a number of  major national parks, most having large areas of wilderness.  He then moved into critical administrative positions within  the Park Service, serving as Director of the National Capital  Region, Deputy Director of the Park Service, and then  Director of the Pacific Northwest Region, covering Alaska,  Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  ii  Since 1980 he has served with distinction under Secre­taries  of Interior Cecil Andrus and James Watt. He has been  recognized for his high level of achievement through numerous  awards, including the Department of the Interior's highest  honor-the Distinguished Service Award.  It is with deepest personal pleasure that I welcome  Russ Dickenson.  ~-  ~""'\.'  .. ;.fF'- ~ : ? - ~ .. · P. , .. · . \ ..... /~1  --~~a ~~  (4'~:~ -~  .·"" /~~ • . ··J .,.._..  Dr. john H.

Dickenson  Here, in an academic setting, I am tempted to use an  old classroom device. If I asked each of you to draft a com­prehensive  definition of the word ""wilderness,"" I am confident  that I would get a range of answers reflecting the range of  experience, philosophy, and perceptions you represent.  To most Americans, wilderness is a term nearly synony­mous  with ""jungle""-there is a strong emphasis on ""wild,""  combined with a sense of dark, tangled forests. There is a  feeling that wilderness is even a bit frightening, a place where  one might easily lose all sense of direction, confront unknown  hazards, face the ultimate test of man against nature.  Many people, perhaps even some here today, would be  surprised to learn how broadly the dictionary defines this  term. My desk edition offers four choices: the first is ""an  uncultivated, uninhabited region; waste; wild""; second choice  is ""any barren, empty, or open area, as of ocean""; third is  ""a large, confused mass or tangle of persons or things""; and  fourth, described as obsolete, is ""a wild condition or quality.""1  To many of us, the obsolete definition is, in fact, the  most accurate. It admits the possibility of urban wilderness;  it recognizes the depths of swamps and jungles; it encompasses  the sweep of Arctic tundra or desert sands; it includes moun­tains  and barrier islands. ""A wild condition or quality""  demonstrates a tie to time, permits us to consider both the  degradation and the regeneration of wilderness, the ever­changing  nature of wilderness and what it holds.  Without Use ... an Unread Book  I believe the importance of wilderness lies in the dynamics  of change. We can turn to the wild lands of America to  understand much of what is happening in this world of ours.  I also believe that we should actively use our wilderness.  Without use, a wilderness has no more value than an unread  book or a locked library. Used properly, it has more to tell  us than all the volumes in the Library of Congress.  Our approach to wilderness should be not unlike that of  the librarian or the book-lover. We should inventory it,  catalogue it, and care for it. We should observe the trends,  note the subtleties of tones and terms.  If we are the scholars of this wild library, searching  learned tomes, we must share these places with those who  seek out light reading as well. And we should remember that  close scholarship can be limiting as well as enlightening.  If our most magnificent wilderness is like the library  which serves equally the musicologist and the philosopher,  the mathematician and the physician, then our smaller  libraries may serve more specialized audiences, this one for  the lover of mysteries, that one for the reader of histories.  As my career has been in parks, I will speak of wilder­ness  in terms of parks. Nevertheless, I think what I have to  say applies equally well to any wilderness, including the  ocean wilderness noted in my dictionary.  I am a land manager and a public servant. These crucial  elements of my job affect my perceptions. They also recall  2  the twin elements for which the National Park Service  was established: ""To conserve the scenery and the natural  and historic objects and the wild life .... and to provide for  the enjoyment of same in such manner and by such means  as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future  generations. ""2  National parks are not to be subjected to normal con­sumptive  uses, otherwise they would not long remain national  parks. Rather, what we seek is measured, controlled, and  respectful public use. Again, I am like a librarian. I send  books back to the bindery when the pages start to come out;  I have a staff to explain-interpret-the resources in our care;  I have a maintenance staff whose job is to accomplish the  necessary cleaning and repair, a security staff to protect  against wanton destruction and vandalism, and a research  staff, dedicated to finding every answer or idea proclaimed  by catchy titles or hidden in obscure footnotes.  Wilderness has an infinite variety of values for people.  Many of us receive satisfaction simply from knowing wild  lands exist. As I noted at the beginning, we each have a  personal definition, encompassing our own experiences,  philosophy, and perceptions. What is more important is  that each of those definitions is valid.  When I was a young ranger at Grand Canyon National  Park, running the Colorado River was a rare and risky chal­lenge.  It embodied many of the traits associated with the  Old West-rugged individualism at its extreme, tough men,  severe danger, awesome sights. Gradually, more people  sought that challenge, and the rewards it brought.  Within the last 20 years, we have seen dramatic changes.  Regulated water flows from Glen Canyon Dam reduce some  of the risks; the advent of rubber rafts and professional guides  reduce others; the introduction of motors added speed to  the journey. Those who run the river today differ from those  of years past in that each passenger has less sense of the  drama, perhaps Jess appreciation of the canyon's awesomeness,  but also less reckless abandon. If the thrill of conquest  is less, then seeking thrills for their own sake is also less.  3  Though some among you may disagree, I think we have  achieved something very important. We have utilized the  changes in the world about us to open this particular use to  more users. But these visitors are more respectful-for  example, they carry out their own waste and litter-and they  have been exposed to a wilderness world once virtually beyond  human attainment. The modern river runner is an appreciater,  not a conqueror. Indeed, we have paid a price for these  changes, but we have been repaid in human terms. Another  great work has been taken from the rare book room and put  into general circulation. Not everyone will check it out, nor  fully understand it, but it is now within his or her reach.  This pattern is repeated throughout the national park  system. We have seen the Appalachian Trail in the East and  the John Muir Trail in the West graduate from eli test obscurity  to mainstream objectives. For those trails, and others, we  have progressed to the point where we must act to protect  fragile resources. Today, we limit use of some trail sections  because of our concern for carrying capacities. We have  begun to study remote areas to find the outside limits on  reasonable human use.  Recognizing Demands  Some would turn the clock back, attempting to make  the wilderness as impenetrable as it was 50 or 100 years ago.  Aside from the practical knowledge that time will go forward  whether we like it or not, I think that is the wrong approach.  Our job is to recognize the increasing demand and find ways  to accommodate it so that we do simultaneously serve the  public's needs and protect resources in our care.  We need places where man-or woman-can be alone.  We need room for modern Thoreaus and Muirs to study, con­template,  and gain inspiration. But in 1850, Thoreau's  America had only 23 million people and Muir's of 1900 had  but 76 million. Our America has 230 million, plus a mobility  those men never dreamed of. For every Muir, we now have  three, for every Thoreau, ten. Is it any wonder that there is  more pressure for use of our wild lands?  4  We must see parks and wildernesses in terms of people  and their needs. If a modern Thoreau seeks quiet, he also  cultivates his garden. The modern Muir wants his cabin in  the woods. This is not to say Thoreau and Muir abused the  land-they did not. But they used it in ways appropriate to  their time and the competition for the resources they  enjoyed. We must do likewise. We cannot allow private  gardens and cabins in our wilderness if we are to protect it  for posterity. But we can allow nonconsumptive uses suited  to our times. Wilderness, as defined in federal statute/ is  protected land. So it should remain.  In May 1980, the National Park Service sent to Congress  an assessment of the State of the Parks.4 That report repre­sented  the first time that the Service had evaluated the condi­tions  of its natural and cultural resources on a servicewide  basis. It revealed unexpected problems throughout. It  suggested that some of the basic resources, for which the  parks had originally been established, were being seriously  threatened by a wide assortment of both internal and  external activities. Most of the country's grand scenic parks  reported more than double the servicewide mean number of  threats. That documentation suggests that the National Park  Service has not been the good steward that we and so many  of our supporters believed us to be. But I challenge that.  Wilderness parks formerly were protected by a degree of  isolation. Parks which once had relatively few developments  or resource uses adjacent to their borders now face many  developmental and environmental changes. Some of these  changes not only sharply reduce the isolation factor, but  threaten the integrity of wilderness values and other ingre­dients  important to long-term perpetuation of natural,  undisturbed conditions. While the National Park Service may  warn, advise and cajole about those effects on parks,  decision-making authority to mitigate threats in many  instances lies outside the National Park Service.  The State of the Parks report received considerable  attention from the Congress, from the press, from with in the  Service, and from the American public as a whole. It focused  attention on the resources and reminded the Service of its  5  primary mandate to protect the significant natural and  cultural resources. In a sense, it awakened the Service to the  reality that, if the reported threats are to be dealt with,  action must begin immediately, and the people of the United  States and decision-makers at all levels-city, county, state and  federal- must be informed and involved.  In a January 1981 followup report-""State of the  Parks: A Report to the Congress on a Servicewide Strategy  for Prevention and Mitigation of Natural and Cultural  Resource Management Problems,""5 we outlined both short­and  mid-term strategies for addressing the numerous threats.  I want to talk, now, about the strategy we outlined in the  prevention/mitigation report. Increased emphasis has been  placed on the need for completing area resources manage­ment  plans by December 1 of this year. Area plans are the  principal planning statement for developing a systematic  approach to resource problem documentation, ranking, and  mitigation, forming the basis for annual budgets. No new  research or resources management programs will be funded  unless first documented in an approved resources manage­ment  plan.  To Be Good Stewards  The National Park Service has just completed a period  of considerable growth. It is now time to consolidate our  gains and to make sure that we become the good stewards  necessary to properly care for that trust that the American  public has given us.  Emphasis now must be placed on the fundamentals of  park management-systematic decision-making, fiscal respon­sibility,  efficiency, accountability. It is back to the basics.  Time, in this instance, is not an ally. From here in  Idaho, it is easy to point to some of the very real threats  facing park resources which any of us could reach tomorrow.  Glacier National Park, northeast of us, faces an incredible  6  range of problems. Mining, logging, air and water pollution,  all occurring or planned beyond the park's borders, may  jeopardize one of the last strongholds of the mighty grizzly  bear.  It is essential to remember that we are talking about  once-remote sites, places our own grandfathers would have  had difficulty reaching, even if they had been as close as we  are today.  While such parks may never have been truly remote to  us-only to our ancestors-think for a moment of Mount  McKinley, the nation's highest peak. Ten years ago, access to  McKinley was difficult and time-consuming. In a heavy year,  25,000 people found their way to the park. Today, new  roads and good air service would allow an apartment dweller  from New York City to leave home tonight and reach the  slopes of McKinley tomorrow. In 1980, the park recorded  297,800 visits. And, we can only expect those figures to rise in  the future.  The McKinley experience is a sharp reminder of our dual  mission and its basis. Without the resources, there would  be little purpose for people to seek out parks. But without  the people interested in those resources, there would be  little public support for their preservation and protection.  The people and the resources are closely linked, and must  remain so. When they become separated, we will all lose.  The management of human activities to achieve and  maintain a predetermined resource condition is absolutely  necessary if we are to give the resources adequate protection.  It requires a systematic approach that involves all of the  expertise available today!  The most difficult facet of all management schemes is  the management of human beings, the regulation of human  use. In the long run, the success of any park management  program depends on informed public support. Such support  is developed through courteous, helpful visitor services;  through informational and educational programs; and by  7  providing immediate tangible benefits-service-to the public.  Above all, we must demonstrate, through successful manage­ment  and operation of parks, the principle of stewardship.  And, we must foster the understanding and acceptance of a  stewardship ethic by the American people.  I have found, on recent visits to parks, that there is a  renewed resource awareness all across the Service. The wel­fare  of the National Park Service's natural and cultural  resources has become a principal concern of the nundreds  of park rangers and other dedicated employees working at all  levels within the system. The intensity of that commitment  also has increased, and the demand for professional resources  management is greater now than at any other time in our  history. I strongly support this new wave of attention.  Freeman Tilden, in his book, ""Interpreting Our Heritage,""  stated:  ""Protection and preservation of the physical  memorials of our natural and historic origins is  primary, of course. And I suppose a good case  could be made for the mere locking-up of our most  important treasures-the fragile and the irreplace­able  and the ""bank deposits'' of study in future  years-because they are arks of our covenant and  even when not seen are an inspiration through the  feeling that they exist and are safe.  ""But fortunately, save in rare instances, this is not  at all required. We can use these precious resources,  so long as we do not use them up. Put it this way:  we should not dissipate our capital, but we should  zealously dispense the interest.""6  We must dispense that interest to our shareholders, the  citizens of this country. We seek profit only for the share­holders,  not personal profit.  Part of the shareholder profit has to do with the nature  of the resources found in our parks. Gone today is the lush  8  forest primeval that covered much of the east when the first  European settlers arrived. Gone are the vast sweeps of prairie  that once covered mid-continent America. Gone are the  passenger pigeon, the Carolina parakeet, and the ivory­billed  woodpecker. The timber wolf, bison, and grizzly have  been reduced to remnant populations. The varieties of fish-  1 ife and plants that have become his tory are uncounted.  Charged to Protect  The parks, in many cases, encompass scattered communi­ties  of rare and unique species. They can be vital to our  future. It is our charge to protect what we have. In the  perpetuation of the strange, the unusual, the little understood,  we may hold the key to the perpetuation of our own kind.  For all that we have managed to control, our destiny is  still tied to the land and sea of this planet.  We should not casually throw away any life form. We  should study it, protect it, find its usefulness or, failing  that, leave it for our descendants to assess anew.  It is estimated that our planet has 80,000 edible varieties  of plants of which man has used, at one time or another,  about 3,000. Yet only 150 varieties ·have ever been culti­vated  on a large scale, with fewer than 20 producing 90  percent of the world's food.  Obscure plants may indeed save us all. Within the rela­tively  brief span of the history of America, we have seen the  development of such modern staples as corn, peanuts, and  soybeans. The recent discovery of a native, evergreen corn  plant in the foothills of central Mexico holds great promise  for improved food supplies the world over. This plant,  hybridized with the perennial corn plants developed over the  past century, could vastly increase the potential yield of  every cornfield.  Such discoveries would not be possible without the pre­servation  of the species. In this case, the corn plant could  9  easily have been lost had not a Texas botanist found it in a  forest destined for clearcutting to make way for cattle  grazing.  The parks, then, offer a special hope, one seldom given  much public attention. The wilderness is a gene pool of  unimagined proportions. Medical science has been quick to  accept the potential that our botanical life holds. For food  purposes, our species still has a great reluctance to experi­ment.  The natural storehouses of parks may someday prove  invaluable. We must remember that the purple foxglove  of Europe is the source for digitalis, a common heart com­pound  to which millions can credit their lives. And who  would care to go back to a time when the infamous bread  mold, Penicillium, was just a common nuisance.  The parks also may hold the future for the fuel needs  of the world. Some species found in them may be the key  to methane production or some other, yet unknown, power  source.  Greater emphasis must be placed on the acquisition of  baseline information . Few parks presently have an adequate  inventory of their natural resources. Few parks possess ade­quate  information to implement enlightened management  strategies. Good knowledge of the identity and location of  park resources is prerequisite to wise stewardship. Improving  the park's database will require that priority be given to  conducting field studies on all types of physical and bio­logical  resources.  The scientist's role must be one of information gathering  and analysis. The scientist's responsibility must be to provide  decision-makers with sound alternative solutions to problems  previously identified and ranked by the park manager. The  scientist must inform the manager what options are available  to meet a certain standard. Long-term monitoring programs  designed for early-warning systems are essential. Wilderness  reserves should be this nation's biological control units.  10  Wilderness Potential  If wilderness preservation and study are not to be  bewildering, we must take the initiative. We must make the  nation-and the world-aware of the potential that lies in the  wilderness. And we must make them aware of its fragility.  Wilderness should be used, but never debased.  We face a monumental task. Not only do we need to  unlock the vast storehouse of knowledge and information  that is hidden in the wilderness, we need to overcome the  prejudices conjured up by that term.  Think back, if you will, to the definitions I read early in  my remarks. Many of the terms are laden with pejorative  messages: ""waste,"" ""barren,"" ""empty,"" and ""confused""  were all used to define wilderness.  We must show the doubters that our interest is vital to  theirs. There was a time, eloquently expressed by Alfred  Runte in his book, ""National Parks: The American Experi­ence,""  7 that worthlessness was the most effective argument  for preserving wilderness areas. The congressional debates  leading to the creation of Yosemite, Yellowstone, Mount  Rainier, Crater Lake and most other early park areas empha­sized  the economic and agricultural barrenness of these lands.  Such arguments may have been necessary in less sophisti­cated  times. Today, they would be contrary to the public  interest we seek to serve.  We must demonstrate that wilderness-its preservation,  and research into its resources-is a vital national concern.  How else can we demonstrate, when government fiscal con­straint  is obviously sought by the people, that protecting  wilderness should hold a sufficient public priority to warrant  continuing expenditure of public funds?  We have only begun to understand what the wilderness  has to offer. Our research has just touched the surface. But  we are already overdue in putting out the word.  11  We must guard our wilderness resources, jealously and  zealously. But, in guarding them, we must also share them.  We must overcome the arrogance built of our own knowledge  of, and love for, the wilderness.  I would be the last person to argue that placing our  prized possessions in untutored hands can be done without  risk. But I firmly believe that the real message in this is that  we must be the tutors. We must presume that people of all  kinds can benefit from the wilderness. We must presume that  people of all kinds are caring and careful when they know  how to be so. Therefore, our role as stewards of the wilder­ness  is to teach the untutored both how and why they should  share in that stewardship.  Public support for national parks and the principles  which guide operation and protection of the national parks  have never been higher. Appreciation of the unique rewards  arising from park visits and public use of wilderness is partially  responsible. But the support also stems from the sure know­ledge  that wilderness lost-for whatever reason-ceases to be  wilderness and may never recover. All the more reason for  setting high standards of wilderness protection and use and  for emphasizing every American's stewardship responsibility.  12  ~ ..  _...:._:.... _,.._  _;~---~  - - ~  ----~  --·------  13  Notes  1 Webster's New World Dictionary of the American  Language. 1968.

Battle for the Wilderness: Our Forever Conflict?,Michael Frome,"Lecture given by Michael Frome. Introduction by Dr. Terry R. Armstrong, Executive Assistant to the President, University of Idaho. The lecture  looks at the concept of wilderness preservation and the viability of it in the 1980's socio-political context. Frome opens with a commentary on Secretary of the Interior, James G. Watt's view of wilderness. He rebuttals the Secretary's extreme views of Democrats and environmentalists with the idea that conservation is the American mindset. The lecture then emphasizes the need to preserve wilderness, 'for its own sake, not for its utility'. This is again emphasized through the metaphor of an interpreter of art; humans cannot create a landscape, only enjoy it and create homages to nature,quoting and citing many authors and artists. The article then expresses Frome's strong belief in the 'reverence of life' that all lives (including those of plants and animals) are important and that 'we are responsible to the future and for the present. The lecture then details victories of conservation in Idaho, including the River of No Return Wilderness. The lecture concludes with the speaker's dedication to the idea of democracy as a tool for the people to gain power and responsibility of conserving wilderness. Bibliography is included and the last page is an announcement by Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe, Director of the Wilderness Research Center, University of Idaho, of the Michael Frome Scholarship for Excellence in Conservation Writing.

Illustrations by Lorraine Ashland  Introduction  TERRY R. ARMSTRONG  I t gives me great personal pleasure to welcome you to­night  to the sixth in the annual series of Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureships. It is sponsored by the University  of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The Center is working  to foster research and educational activities which will lead to  a broader understanding of wilderness and natural ecosystems  and man's relationship to them. In what has become a fine  academic tradition, the Wilderness Research Center has  sponsored the Lectureship to encourage constructive dialogue  and to broaden our understanding of the management of  wilderness resources. Speakers of national prominence have  been invited on the basis of their contributions to the philo­sophical  and scientific rationale of wilderness management.  Tonight we are fortunate to continue this tradition with  author and conservationist Michael Frome. He is currently  serving as a Visiting Associate Professor in the School of  Communication and the Department of Wildland Recreation  Management at the University of Idaho.  Michael began his career as a newspaper reporter and  editor, working at the Washington Post and the International  i  News Service before serving as a navigator with the U.S.  Army Air Corps in World War II. In 1959, he became a free­lance  journalist and author and soon published Whose Woods  These Are: The Story of the National Forests, which became  a selection of the Literary Guild and Outdoor Life Book  Club. Other books that followed were Strangers in High  Places: the Story of the Great Smokey Mountains; The Na­tional  Parks; The National Forests of America; Rand McNally  National Park Guide; The Forest Service; and Battle for the  Wilderness. A series of articles, ""The Ungreening of the  National Parks,"" earned him the award for best magazine  article in 1980 from the American Society of J ou rna I ists and  Authors. He is currently working on a book to be released  soon, The Forest Service -a Profile of History, Policy and  Performance, and on a book about National Parks and wild  places of America.  Michael Frome has devoted his career to being an  author, conservationist, naturalist, social critic, and a voice  for the wilderness. Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel  said in 1972, ""I consider Michael Frome one of the finest  environmental writers in the nation-courageous, accurate,  and widely respected for his integrity. Mike tells it 'like it  is,' not necessarily like we'd like to think it is."" Where the  wild is concerned, he is more than a writer or observer; he is  a champion with perspective and vision. He has become a  truly leading American spokesman in matters of conserva­tion.  Won't you please join me now in welcoming Michael  Frome.  Dr. Terry R. Armstrong is Executive Assistant to the  President, University of Idaho.  ii  iii  iv  BATTLE FOR  THE WILDERNESS:  OUR FOREVER  CONFLICT?  Michael Frome  Is wilderness preservation a valid concept in our time?  Is it compatible with American ideals and with Americanism?  Often I ask myself such questions. I ask them as one who has  reaped the fruits of life in this our land. I ask them as one  who responded years ago, when I was young, to the call in  defense of our institutions. What was it I sought to defend?  Was it land, lifestyle, or liberty? Are these somehow  invisible? Could it be, I now wonder, that some instinct im­pelled  me to protect these last vestiges of primeval America,  even while serving in distant corners of the globe?  The Northwest is a fitting region in which to review and  reassess the place and purpose of wilderness in the American  design. Idaho, in particular, is singularly blessed, a rich  repository enhancing the quality of life, if one chooses to  view it that way. Consider that this state embraces the largest  single designated wilderness unit outside of Alaska, the 2.2  million-acre River of No Return Wilderness in central Idaho,  plus other areas of substantial size and classic proportions.  Moreover, Idaho and its neighboring states at this hour in  history comprise a focal point of conflict over how much  more of our commonly-held landed heritage should be allo­cated  for preservation.  ""America must have a sound economy if it is to be a  good steward of its fish and wildlife, its parks, and all of  its natural resources,""1 James G. Watt, Secretary of the  Interior, has stated in expressing the cornerstone of his  own and this administration's policy toward wilderness. As  he reasons, raw materials such as oil, gas, and hard  metals which may be locatable in wilderness are critical to  the public weal and must be developed.  Secretary Watt, of course, is not alone in this viewpoint.  Some leaders of the forest products industry and the U.S.  Forest Service have long resisted the wilderness allocation of  public lands capable of growing commercial timber. As they  repeatedly insist, denying commercial use of still unclassified  roadless areas in the national forests poses a significant threat  to individual communities and to regions such as the North­west,  and thus to the nation as a whole.  In the discussion and debate over wilderness, however,  no individual has been more evocative or provocative than  Secretary Watt. Regardless of his viewpoint or style, he has  forced the issue before the American public.  Two years ago Secretary Watt tested wilderness in  Grand Canyon National Park. He subsequently related to a  conference of national park concessioners his experience in  traveling down the Colorado River. He said he had gone in  order to learn about the phase-out of motors on rubber rafts  as proposed by the National Park Service.  ""The first day was spectacular. .. the second day started  to get a little tedious, but the third day I wanted bigger  motors to move that raft out. There is no way you could get  me on an oar-powered raft on that river-1 'II guarantee you  that. On the fourth day we were praying for helicopters and  they came.""2  2  When these comments became known, Nathaniel P.  Reed, a former Assistant Secretary of the Interior, under  whom Watt once served, quipped as follows:  ""If he had his druthers he'd probably run the lower  Colorado by hovercraft ... his insensitivity to the beauty and  adventure of the West is appalling .... It's as though Secre­tary  Watt can't tell the difference between national parks and  industrial parks. ""3  This may well be true, but my own response to the  Secretary's account of his experience is different in nature.  I feel that he has caused the nation to examine and re­examine  the role of national parks and of wilderness, which  should never be taken for granted simply because they are  there.  Essence of the Democratic System  Conflict is expensive and time-consuming-that is quite  true-and sometimes both sides lose. On the other hand,  open discussion, challenge and dissent fortify institutions,  whether public or private, and are the essence of the demo­cratic  system. As an official of a major forest products firm  stated before my class in public affairs reporting at this  university:  ""We were dragged kicking and screaming into the age of  the environment, but we are now endeavoring to fulfill our  corporate social responsibility. ""4  I've heard such comments many times from diverse  quarters of government and industry: of how challenge of  the Alaska pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez improved  its efficiency and lessened its impact on the land; of how the  National Environmental Policy Act has broadened vistas of  federal agencies, and of how a sound environment has proven  to be sound economics as well.  It grieves me, therefore, when advocates of wilderness  protection are derided as ""extremists"" and ""fanatics"" respon-  3  sible for hard times and for working against the good of the  nation. To cite James Watt: ""I'm never partisan. I never use  the words Republican and Democrat. It's liberals and Ameri­cans.""  5 And commenting on environmentalists, ""They are  political activists, a left-wing cult which seeks to bring down  the type of government I believe in."" 6  John B. Crowell, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture with  authority over the national forests, has had considerable ex­perience  with wilderness and its proponents, principally as an  adversary, during his former career as an attorney in the  forest products industry. ""I think the bulk of the people who  belong to the Sierra Club and Audubon Society are people  who have a genuine concern about the treatment of our  natural resources,"" recognizes Secretary Crowell based on  his encounters with these groups. ""On the other hand, I'm  sure the organizations are also infiltrated by people who have  very strong ideas about socialism and even communism."" 7  When taken to task in the media, Mr. Crowell recanted.  He said he was sorry he had made the statement; regrettably,  he failed to say that he didn't believe it.  I must also quote from a report issued by the Republi­can  Study Committee in the House of Representatives, warn­ing  against the ""specter of environmental ism"" and the  ""hidden I iberal agenda."" According to this study: ""Environ­mentalists  are liberals and self-motivated and intent on pre­serving  their privileged social status. "" 8  Personally I feel wholly patriotic when standing up to  exercise my rights of free expression and to defend America  the Beautiful. It disturbs me when officials in high places  try to limit debate by putting labels on those who disagree  with them, who deride and impugn the motives of those  who want to be heard.  John P. Saylor, who died in 1973 after almost a quarter  century in Congress, was a principal sponsor of the Wilder­ness  Act of 1964 and a champion of wilderness throughout  his career. He was a man I knew and admired, a towering  figure with indomitable will. I recall how once he phoned me  4  from his sickbed at Bethesda Naval Hospital asking that I  help prepare a statement denouncing the killing of eagles in  the West. He was highly respected by his colleagues. A testi­monial  in his honor was graced by the warm participation of  the then Republican leader in the House, Gerald Ford. When  Mr. Saylor died, Jo Skubitz, an influential Republican from  Kansas, took up the cudgel for one of Saylor's favorite cam­paigns:  legislation to protect the vista of the Potomac from  George Washington's home at Mount Vernon. ""We must do  this for John,"" Skubitz pledged and pleaded, though he him­self  was generally negative on environmental issues.  John Saylor left his mark on resource pol icy; he belongs  in history alongside Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot  as Republicans who blazed conservation trails. Yet he was  not ""liberal"" or ""progressive,"" whatever those words may  mean, in all things. He received the John Muir Medal from  the Sierra Club, but also was presented a distinguished service  award by an ultra-conservative group, Americans for Consti­tutional  Action. He was impelled by good old-fashioned  patriotism. He was never divisive or destructive, never im­pugned  the motive nor questioned the loyalty of those who  disagreed with him. He demonstrated that conservation advo­cacy  belongs to no party and to no single point of view.  Two Dinners in Vermont  James G. Watt has had a moment in the sun, reportedly  an effective fund raiser on the political circuit, yet I question  the extent of his popular support, particularly in recent  months. Last spring he went to Vermont to headline a  Republican fund-raising dinner. In that conservative New  England state, less than 50 persons attended, while a coali­tion  of Vermont environmental groups, conducting their own  fund-raising dinner on the same night, sold out tickets for  all 500 seats.  I'm especially proud of the principal speaker at that  environmental dinner, Dr. Carl Reidel, because he is a for­ester  (a past president of the American Forestry Association),  an educator, and head of the department in which I was priv-  5  ileged to serve at the University of Vermont. His memorable  words that night have a touch of universality. One could  easily substitute ""Idaho"" for ""Vermont"" in these few lines  that I will quote:  ""We are here together to celebrate Vermont-the land,  the people, and the accomplishments of the past which make  this is a special place to live and work. We are here also to  serve notice that Vermont's conservation community is  united in its determination to protect this state against selfish  exploitation from any quarter- from Mr. Watt, Mr. Reagan,  or anyone else who seeks to compromise Vermont's environ­mental  heritage.  ""Party politics is not an issue .... The vital question  before us is the future quality of life in this state, this nation,  and the world. We are here to serve notice on national and  state leaders alike, regardless of their political colors, that  Vermont is not for sale. ""9  The world is watching, watching Vermont, Alaska, the  nation's capital in Washington, James Watt, Idaho, you and  me as we play our roles in the democratic process. The world  looks to the United States for leadership, for direction in the  development of rational, responsible, ethical and moral  policy to protect nature. Since establishment of Yellowstone  in 1872 as the first national park anywhere on earth, we have  been regarded as the trailblazers of preservation. The reputa­tion  has been sustained through one pioneering action after  another in defense of forests, wildlife, parks, soils, water, and  air. With passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, the United  States became the first nation to declare recognition of  wilderness through law, to define wilderness as implicit in its  way of life, culture, and legacy to the future.  The rest of the world has taken heart from our lead. In  Great Britian, Lady Sayer, prime mover of the Dartmoor  Preservation Association, has pleaded for a halt to the tragic  disintegration of upland moors. Her words are poignant and  powerful: ""the rocks and heather, ... the gorse and the bogs.  That is wild country, and in Britain it is all we have left of  truly virgin land; and it is slowly vanishing, not only in  Britain but in every part of our man-polluted planet. ""1 0  6  What answer do we provide to Lady Sayer, what answer  to the world? What answer to the challenge of Albert  Schweitzer, who wrote so gloomily that man has lost the  capacity to foresee and forestall, and will end by destroying  the earth .  If commercial development must be granted priority,  if economics and environment are not to be considered com­patible,  if wilderness cannot be appreciated and accepted­and  proudly defended-as part of this civilization, the future  is clear. The intensifying exploitation of oil, gas, coal, of all  resources and raw materials will threaten and devour every­thing:  marshes, deserts, prairies, rivers, the last shreds of vir­gin  forest. And Schweitzer's prophecy will be fulfilled.  The worst thing that can happen in our time, as natural  scientists have warned, is not energy depletion, nor even eco­nomic  collapse, awesome as these may be, but the loss of  biotic diversity in the natural habitats. Much has been written  and spoken about vanishing species and the galloping rate of  extinction of species, but these derive directly from the loss  of wild places. Biotic diversity, after all, is something you  don't make in a laboratory or in a multiple-use management  plan.  7  How much wilderness does it take to fulfill civilization's  needs? That should never be the question; what counts more  is whether each succeeding generation must settle for an in­creasingly  degraded world and know the marvels of the past  from books and pictures only. The greatest tragedy is failure  to recognize that as land and landscape are altered so too are  we. As Lady Sayer puts it: ""The value of wild country to the  nation-that is, its value to human beings present and future­far  transcends even its possession ... of our past or the abun­dance  of its wild life. Its greatest value of all lies in what it  can still give us of freedom, challenge and inspiration."" 11  I value the earth for its own sake, not for its uti I ity.  The earth is living poetry, music, art, a source of spiritual  well-being that cannot be found or matched elsewhere. Thus  wilderness enables me, in humility, to know myself as part of  a limitless cosmos, vaster than our crowded, technological  human community.  Artist as Interpreter  The artist or poet, after all, can't create a landscape or  invent the place. He or she serves only as the interpreter. As  Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, literature, poetry and science  all are mankind's homage to unfathomed secrets of nature.  In terms of music, I recently read a surprising statement by  John Cage, the master of contemporary electronic sound,  who said the music he prefers, even to his own or anybody  else's, is what we hear if we are just quiet. And what better  place to be quiet and listening than wilderness?  Wilderness by law is ""an area where the earth and its  community of life are untrammeled by man, where man  himself is a visitor who does not remain,""1 2 but that's only  a legal definition. Stephen Crane, author of The Red Badge  of Courage, in 1892 depicted the mountain forest near his  home at Port Jervis, New York, as follows:  ""In the wilderness sunlight is noise. Darkness is a great  tremendous silence accented by small and distant sounds.  The music of the wind in the trees is a song of loneliness.  8  On the ridgetop a dismal choir of hemlocks croons over one  that has fallen."" 13  I am endeavoring here to demonstrate by illustration  how deeply love of wilderness is rooted in our national cul­ture  and psyche. I could start with the enchanting botanical  explorations of William Bartram during the colonial period.  Or with the works of James Fenimore Cooper, our first  novelist of note (who may be said to have written the earliest  westerns). ""This is grand!-'tis solemn! 'tis an education in  itself to look upon!"" exulted Natty Bumppo, Cooper's John  Wayne-like hero, on viewing the ""Giimmerglass,"" where a  man could stand on the shore and hear the song of the  panther from the encircling forest. 14 Prophetically, Cooper  warned with power and clarity against ""wasty ways""-of  burning timber and brush after clearing the land, and of the  sheer illusion in the appearance of infinite resources.  Artists like John J. Audubon, Thomas Cole, George  Catlin, Carl Bodmer, Alfred Jacob Miller, Albert Bierstadt,  Thomas Moran and Charles M. Russell all drew heavily from  wilderness and often sought to bespeak its defense through  their work. They, in turn, would influence poets, as evi­denced  in this tribute to Cole by William Cullen Bryant:  Lone Lakes-savannas where the bison roves-  Rocks rich with summer garlands-solemn streams­Skies,  where the desert eagle wheels and screams­Spring  bloom and autumn blaze of boundless groves.15  Mark Twain conjured the mysterious river world brim­ming  with freshness and life, while Bret Harte, his friend,  celebrated the virgin forest of the wild Sierra Nevada Range.  Of Walt Whitman, poet of national destiny, it is recorded that  ""he liked to read the great poets in the open air within sound  of the sea."" At Coney Island, following a swim, he would  race up and down the sand of a long, bare, unfrequented  beach ""declaiming ... Shakespeare to the surf and gulls. He  first read the Iliad thoroughly in a sheltered hollow of the  rocks, in the full presence of nature, under the sun,"" absorb­ing  a ""far-spreading landscape ... and the sea rolling in ... "" 16  9  Culture and creativity would be barren without the re­source  of wild places. Down to our time, artists, writers,  poets and photographers have enriched our lives and the  life of the nation - Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin, Rockwell  Kent, Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Eliot Porter, Rachel  Carson, Sigurd Olson, William 0. Douglas, Wallace Stegner,  Loren Eisely, Joseph Wood Krutch, Edward Abbey, and Paul  Brooks- these and others have drawn their inspiration from  wilderness and shared it with generations of Americans.  ""At the gates of the forest, the surprised man of the  world is forced to leave his city estimates of great and small,  wise and foolish,"" wrote Emerson in his essay on ""Nature.""  ""The knapsack of custom falls off his back with the first step  he makes into these precincts .... Here we find nature to be  the circumstance which dwarfs every other circumstance,  and judges I ike a god all men that come to her."" 17  John Muir, that long-bearded, long-legged uncommon  champion of nature and his fellow man, said it a little differ­ently:  ""There is a love of wild nature in everybody, an  ancient mother-love showing itself whether recognized or no,  and however covered by cares and duties."" 18  But Henry David Thoreau evoked still a loftier idea to  raise the human heart and spirit. ""This curious world which  we inhabit,"" he wrote, ""is more wonderful than it is con­venient;  more beautiful that it is useful; it is more to be ad­mired  and enjoyed than used."" 19  We modern Americans have yet to fully comprehend  this idea, yet to rise above the notions of a wholly material­istic,  mechanistic, man-contrived and man-dominated earth. It  was not always this way. The Gold Rush marked a watershed,  dividing an age of morality and generous impulse and an age  of money lust and cynicism. Herman Melville, through the  words of Babbalanja in Mardi, expressed his feelings on true  and false earthly values: ""Deep, Yoomy, deep, true treasure  lies; deeper than all Mardi's gold ... But unlike gold, it  lurks in every soil. ... Gold is the only poverty; of all the  glittering ills the direst .... But man will still mine for it;  and, mining, dig his doom.""20 And in his masterpiece,  Moby Dick, Melville portrayed a drama of symbolism. In  10  I  I.  I  I  the conflict between Captain Ahab and the great white  whale, the qualities of power, beauty and mystery in nature  are embodied in the whale, while Ahab's vengeance against  the sea exemplifies the immorality of the quest to ravage and  exploit."" ... the moot point is, whether Leviathan can endure  so wide a chase,"" wrote Melville, ""and so remorseless a havoc;  whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters,  and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and  then himself evaporate in the final puff. "" 21  ~~Reverence of Life""  We sorely need to go beyond convention and to know  ourselves as part of a universe shaped of spirit as well as  matter. Schweitzer espoused ""reverence of life."" I mention  Schweitzer as a model for those who profess their concern  for human needs. He walked away from creature comfort in  Strasbourg to establish a jungle hospital in West Africa.  Later he applied his Nobel Prize money to support a leper  colony. In 1957, when the world saw only the good in  nuclear power, he opposed atomic testing because of the  danger of radioactive fallout to humankind.  Man is ethical when life becomes sacred to him,  Schweitzer taught, and not simply his own life, but that of  all humans, and of plants and animals, and when he devotes  himself to other living things. 22 Gifford Pinchot learned the  simple lesson of respect and reverence for life when he went  to the Grand Canyon in 1896. He was there as the youngest  member of the National Forest Commission, quartered with  John Muir, already an illustrious personality. Pinchot pre­pared  to kill a tarantula, but Muir stopped him, advising that  it had as much right to be there as they did. 23  ""For you must say Yes to Life wherever it is found, and  it is found in some terrible places."" Thus writes James Bald­win,  who is not an environmentalist, as far as I know, but ca­pable  of profound humanist expression. ""But there it is, and  if the father can say Yes Lord, then the child can say that  most difficult of words, Amen. For the sea does not cease to  grind down rock; generations do not cease to be born and we  are responsible to them for we are the only witnesses they  have. ""2 4  11  We are responsible to the future and for the present.  Our generation is overwhelmed with challenges-of war and  peace, overpopulation, energy, food, and the need of each  individual to achieve fulfillment in his or her own way. Yet  possibly the most critical challenge of our time is to protect  the shreds of wilderness that yet remain. I don't mean only  in this country but everywhere in the world. The last few  vestiges of the original earth, as given to us by the Creator  (or by forces of nature) are vanishing so quickly it's frighten­ing  to think about.  It can't all be wilderness, as in the beginning, when all  the earth was a national park. I recognize that, but wilderness  preserved marks humankind's respect for the earth and for  itself. The wild places serve to enrich the civilization of which  they are part.  Release in Solitude  Crowds are everywhere: at airports, hotels, playgrounds  and parks. Crowds have their place, but there are times when  I feel compelled to find release and relief in solitude, listening  to that quiet music of which John Cage wrote. I want to be  away, for a while, from mechanical devices and gadgets.  When a person enters a machine he relegates himself to being  a cog in the machinery. There's reward in doing something  on one's own with personal energy, whatever it may be,  based on the individual's capacity, a sense of self-sufficiency  away from a supercivilized world.  Eastern practices, such as Tai-chi and yoga, strive for  inner harmony and outward calm as the keystone of mental  and physical health. Pranayama, one of the key elements of  yoga, is a process of gaining control over the prana, the vital  energy, by isolating the inner self from the influence of  worldly thoughts. It is best achieved alone with nature, in a  setting free of refinements of modern life, peaceful, quiet,  clean, where one can shed anger and negative thought, search  his soul, and restore normal harmony of mind and body.  The same search after the intangible values implicit  in earth and sky is manifest in our Western culture, as evi­denced  by art, poetry, music and by an unfailing determina­tion  to protect wild sanctuaries, even against heavy odds.  12  It is sometimes argued that wilderness is the playground  of elite and effete urbanites, but I don't believe it. In our  society the public everywhere is rightfully entitled to a voice  in determining policies governing federally-administered  lands; yet such policies will succeed only with support and  understanding of the neighbors of these lands- and that is  right, too.  Remember that I have been in Idaho before, I came in  the 1960s to observe and write about the battle to save that  marvel of the planet called Hells Canyon of the Snake River.  I came again in the 1970s to the dedication of yet another  marvel, the Birds of Prey Natural Area. Yes, setting aside  these areas is a victory for humankind, but the victory was  made possible by the participation of Idahoans.  I recall vividly the battle over the White Clouds. It was  Cecil Andrus who brought it into focus. ""When I ran for  Governor of Idaho in 1979,"" he declared in presenting the  Wilderness Resource Distinguished Lecture of 1979, ""I  sensed that the people of Idaho also had a growing concern  for the health and beauty of our state as well as its econ­omy.""  25 The people required jobs, he said, but they also  wanted the mountains and valleys where they could hike and  camp, rivers and streams where they could fish, and the en­dowments  where they could enjoy unspoiled nature.  The central issue of the election was whether there  should be open pit mining for molybdenum at the foot of  Castle Peak in the beautiful central Idaho White Cloud  Mountains. ""Contrary to the advice of most of my friends  and supporters,"" Governor Andrus stated in his lecture here,  ""I made this the central theme of my campaign. It was a  clear-cut, black and white issue for the voters. "" 26 Andrus  argued that Idaho must not allow irreplaceable natural re­sources  to be destroyed for temporary economic gain. He  won an overwhelming victory over the incumbent governor,  who had argued for the mine.  I recall the battle over the River of No Return Wilder­ness,  when Senator Frank Church conducted hearings in dif­ferent  sections of the state, and people who had never spoken  publicly before stood up and opened their hearts in praise  13  of an area larger and wilder than Yellowstone, with a greater  variety of fish, plants and wildlife. I recall the enthusiasm of  my old colleague and friend Ted Trueblood, who considered  the River of No Return the most fabulous place anywhere on  earth. When Ted said the water of the Middle Fork was so  clear you could count the spots on a trout beneath six feet of  it, he evoked a depth of feeling for a natural heritage, not  only his own feeling, but of an overwhelming portion of his  fellow citizens of Idaho.  The River of No Return, the largest unit of the National  Wilderness Preservation Sytem outside Alaska, is also the  core of a network of Idaho wilderness, with other units in the  national forests close to it. Six miles northwest of the boun­dary  lies Gospel Hump; two miles north the Selway-Bitter­root;  15 miles south the Sawtooths, where the Salmon River  is born on the slopes of 11 ,000-foot pinnacles. Forty-eight  miles west lies Hells Canyon, protecting 100 miles of the  Snake River, the last significant stretch of the Snake that  still remains undammed and untamed.  Plainly, they're not making such lush islands of green  and crystal anymore, not anywhere on the planet. Idaho  itself isn't what it used to be. Fifteen years ago there were  ten million acres of roadless country, or ""defacto wilder­ness,""  in Idaho's national forests, but much of it has changed  and more change is slated.  Ted Trueblood warned that Idaho has already lost some  of its choicest wild country and that the Forest Service pro­poses  to open still more roadless areas. He said we're not  looking at how much more wilderness we're going to have,  but how much less of it there will be.  My own view is that the lands in question are lovely to  view, but difficult to exploit. The very qualities that make  them unsuitable for development make them valuable to en­joy.  Protecting the watershed protects the streams for cut­throat,  chinook salmon, steelhead, and rainbow trout. The  same is true of protecting the forests for game. You don't  have to do anything to enhance natural beauty; on the other  hand, it's difficult to restore it from the consequences of  erosion and siltation, even with great outlays of money and  time.  14  The truth is that we know very little about wilderness.  The Wilderness Act and National Wilderness Preservation  System represent a beginning rather than a conclusion. An  entire series of new questions are pressing for attention. We  need to explore the actual and potential values of wilderness,  its ecology, economics, the effects of human impacts, the  mechanism to protect smaller tracts in urban areas still in a  relatively untouched state.  Fortunately, this university has the facility in its Wilder­ness  Research Center to conduct and coordinate many such  studies. The Center has already been involved in significant  wilderness resource investigations, but its most important  work, I'm sure, lies ahead.  I can't think of a more fitting location for a center of  wilderness research than here, nor of a more appropriate  role for the University of Idaho. I feel proud to be a part of  this institution, for whatever length of stay, and honored, of  course, to be called upon to deliver this lecture. I want to  express appreciation for the support and understanding I  have received from everyone: Dr. james Fazio and my  other colleagues in the Department of Wildland Recreation  Management; Dr. John Ehrenreich, Dean of the College of  Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences; Dr. Don Coombs,  director of the School of Communication, and Dr. Richard  Gibb, the president of the University, who took the time  from his own schedule to visit my class and broaden horizons  of public affairs reporters in the making. Thanks to those  whom I have mentioned and to all of their colleagues, the  University of Idaho is a special place, a vibrant center of  learning, and of life.  During my adventures in teaching and my years in  writing, I have tried to get one message across, above all.  Simply stated: Regulations have their place; however, social  values cannot be determined or altered by edict or law, but  only by a built-in sense of individual responsibility. The  power in a democracy and free enterprise system, after all,  is with the people. It isn't always easy for the individual, that  is true. Nevertheless, in the unending battle for wilderness, as  in the unending battle to insure personal liberty, the prize is  well worth the effort.  15  Notes  1 Watt, James G. 1981.

In Celebration of Wilderness: The Progress and the Promise,Brock Evans,"Lecture given by Brock Evans. Opening remarks by Dr. Ed Krumpe, Associate Professor in the University of Idaho Department of Wildland Recreation Management and Director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research center. Introduction by Michael Frome. The lecture commences with a brief discussion of Evans' recent defeat in the run for congress, as touched on in the introduction, and why he is glad to be back at the University. The lecture details the long hours and intensive schedule needed to campaign for office, the impact on a canadite's psyche and the process of learning how to operate as a politician. The lecture then ties into the subject of wilderness and why  people feel so strongly about it. Evans gives his own first experience with wilderness, in Glacier National Park, how he moved to Seatle, and got a job protecting wilderness areas with the Sierra Club. The lecture continues the story of Evans' congressional defeat and how a trip into Olympic National Park helped him to heal from that experience. The lesson of the wilderness, he says, is that there is something out there bigger than ourselves and that it will go on. The lecture then sites environmentalists throughout America's history calling for it's preservation, and now that that preservation exists people should not forget that it was fought hard for. The lecture continues with a look at how far conservation has come in four states since the 1960's. Lastly two stories are told exemplifying Evans' motto of 'endless pressure, endlessly applied' as a strategy for winning wilderness conservation through polotics and an example is given of the happy results after those victories are won. At the end of the lecture there is a question and answer section.

Reorganization and the Department of Natural Resources: Implications for Wilderness,Cecil D. Andrus,"Lecture given by Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus. Introduction by Dr. John H, Ehrenreich: Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center at the Univeristy of Idaho. The lecture opens with Andrus' own experiences in the wilderness and how he developed his philosophy of 'environmental concern' using it as a central campaign issue. Andrus expresses the need to learn from the mistakes of the past and to treat the wildernesss with common sense, becoming good stewards. The lecture highlights the dichotomy of number of acres owned by the government, compared to the amount of those acres that have been designated 'Wilderness'. The lecture calls for a creation of a 'Department of Natural Resources as proposed by President Carter' to better orginize and manage wilderness. Lastly the lecture details the history of the conservation of wilderness in Alaska. The final point is once again how the U.S. would benefit from a Department of Natural Resources.

Andrus  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO WILDERNESS RESEARCH CENTER  April 27, 1979  Published in cooperation with the Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station  as Contribution No. 165.  Dean's Introduction  It is my distinct pleasure to introduce Secretary of  the Interior, Cecil D. Andrus, this year's honored speaker in  the University of Idaho's third annual Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lecture Series.  In many ways, this is like welcoming Secretary Andrus  back home. During his six years as governor of Idaho, he had  an active interest in our university and, in fact, was instru­mental  in establishing the University of Idaho Wilderness  Research Center, which is the sponsor of this annual lecture­ship.  In the way of background information, I will be brief,  but should point out that the Secretary got his start in the  woods! In fact, he grew up in logging country, has worked  in a sawmill, and made his home for a while in Orofino. At  the early age of 29 he began his public service career as  state senator from Clearwater County. In 1970 he was elected  to his first term as governor of Idaho, and as many of you  will remember, he was re-elected governor in 1974 by the  largest margin in the state's history. Finally, in January of  1977, he joined President Carter's cabinet as our 42nd  Secretary of the Interior of the United States.  In introducing Secretary Andrus, I think it is very  appropriate to quote something that he said in his inaugural  address back in 1975. He said, ""Conservation is no longer a  pious ideal, it is an element of our survival."" As governor, and  as secretary of the interior, Mr. Andrus has let that be his  guide. He has also demonstrated the rare ability to balance  economic considerations with less tangible benefits and  values when facing the tough decisions related to the use of  natural resources.  Today, Mr. Andrus faces unique challenges in helping to  guide the future of resource management not only in the  lower forty-eight states, but particularly in Alaska, which is  passing through a critical period in its young history. He is  also deeply involved in the question of reorganization of the  Departments of Interior and Agriculture. This will be his  topic today, and it gives me a great deal of pleasure to  welcome Secretary of the Interior, Cecil Andrus.  Dr. john H.

Andrus  Wen I was growing up here in the Northwest, we  lived in the midst of a great, relatively undeveloped area.  De facto wilderness was abundant. Pressures of growth were  the farthest things from our minds.  Even 20 years ago when I was a young man struggling  to support my family in what I called the ""slab, sliver and  knothole business,"" we had little realization of the stresses  we were starting to put on the land, or of the severe stresses  about to close in on us. Regretfully, I can recall skidding logs  down streambeds-because that was the easiest way to move  them-and because those of us in logging in those good old  days simply did not know any better. We were too engrossed  in the everyday effort of earning a living to consider the long­term  damage our activity might cause to fish and wildlife, to  the streams, rivers and watershed, to the forests, and to the  land itself. We thought, as our parents and grandparents and  earlier generations had thought, that the natural resources  of this continent were inexhaustible.  About that time-about two decades ago-strong winds  of change were beginning to blow. Caught up in these winds,  and inspired by the words of Senator john F. Kennedy when  he came to Lewiston to speak, my own perspectives began  to change. By the time I was sworn in as the youngest member  of the Idaho State Senate in 1961, I was beginning to have an  inkling of the need for all of us-in Idaho and across the  nation-to take better care of our natural resources. I was  beginning to understand that there is more to life than earning  a living-that after earning a living we must have a life that is  worthwhile.  During the 1960s there was a dramatic increase in our  nation's environmental awareness. When I ran for Governor  of Idaho in 1970, I sensed that the people of Idaho also had a  growing concern for the health and beauty of our state as  well as its economy. They required jobs, but after work they  wanted mountains and valleys where they could hike and  camp, rivers and streams where they could fish, areas where  they could enjoy nature. My opponent believed the old  ""rape, ruin and run"" philosophy toward natural resources  still prevailed.  We had the perfect issue to test our conflicting assess­ments  of the strength of the environmental ethic in the  state of Idaho. That issue was whether there should be open  pit mining for molybdenum at the foot of Castle Peak in the  beautiful central Idaho White Cloud Mountains. I argued it  would be wrong to jeopardize this area by mining a mineral  which was then-and is today-in surplus. My opponent  argued for the mine.  Contrary to the advice of most of my friends and sup­porters,  I made this the central theme of my campaign. It  was a clear-cut, black and white issue for the voters. They  could choose between an incumbent who represented con­tinued  wide open development, or a new candidate who  demonstrated environmental concern.  2  Arguing that we must not allow irreplaceable natural  resources to be destroyed for temporary economic gain, I  was one of the first to run for public office in the West with  environmental concern as a major issue.  To virtually everyone's surprise, I won. The people of  Idaho agreed with me that after we have earned a living, it  must be worthwhile.  In his new book, Footprints on the Planet, Bob Cahn  stated it this way:  It makes no sense to preserve the environment  at the cost of national economic collapse. Nor  does it make sense to maintain stable indus­trial  productivity at the cost of clean air,  clean water, parks and wilderness. 7  The people of Idaho reaffirmed this philosophy in 1974,  when more than seven out of ten voted for my re-election. I  am convinced the people of Idaho continue to believe that  their government-local, state and federal-must have a strong  commitment to provide balanced management of natural  resources.  In discussing the evolution of national attitudes and  Federal policy toward natural resources, I, like others, have  compared the life of our nation with the life of a person-with  my own life. The young, of course, are blessed with boundless  enthusiasm, ambition and energy. During our youth as a  nation, we had abundant natural resources, and we used  them as necessity dictated. We were anxious to populate the  land and to build a strong country. But in our rush to popu­late  the continent and to increase the productive capacity of  America, we made some of the mistakes of youth. We need­lessly  destroyed portions of our natural heritage.  3  The Challenges of Today's Frontier  Today we have achieved maturity as a nation. This  maturity dictates that we begin practicing common sense  in judging how we use our resources. We are now probing  the outer limits of our natural frontiers.  Today's frontier is facing our problems and not trying  to escape them by moving over yonder hill to virgin territory.  Today's frontier is making the tough decisions between  what natural resources we should develop today, and what  natural resources must be conserved both to provide future  options and to maintain a healthy natural world.  Today's frontier does not involve conquering nature.  Today's frontier lies in conquering our own worst  habits of waste, indifference or selfishness in use of natural  resources.  Evolution of a New Land Ethic  The realization that we must become better stewards  of our natural resources blossomed during the past 15 years,  but the roots are deep in the history of this land. The Indians  who were here when the first Europeans arrived tried to tell  us centuries ago. Here in the West, Chief Joseph tried to  tell us when he said:  Do not misunderstand me, but understand  me fully with reference to my affection for  the land. I never said the land was mine to do  with as I chose. The one who has the right to  dispose of it is the one who created it . .. 2  Some of the early settlers in America saw the need for  conservation, but our people were too busy making a nation  4  to pay much attention. Early in this century, Teddy Roosevelt  gave a great boost to the conservation movement. Some 71  years ago, he said:  To waste, to destroy, our natural resources,  to skin and exhaust the land instead of using  it so as to increase its usefulness, will result in  undermining in the days of our children the  very prosperity which we ought by right to  hand down to them amplified and developed.3  Slowly, Federal policy evolved from disposal of public  land to maintenance of the public lands for the public good.  Slowly, our Federal government has come to see the impor­tance  of preserving wild areas. The first wilderness was set  aside in 1924. Yet it was another 40 years before Congress  enacted the National Wilderness Preservation Act, which  defined wilderness legally.  Each of us, of course, has his own definition of wilder­ness  and what it means. The concept of wilderness enables  use and enjoyment of an area by hunters, backpackers, photo­graphers,  fishermen, boaters, floaters, researchers, outfitters,  guides and pilots-all on a renewable basis that does minimum  damage to the environment and creates minimum interference  with the natural fish and game cycles. Perhaps most important  is the fact that wildarness gives priority to conservation of  the wild! ife, trees and plants which are vital to our natural  world.  There is understandable controversy over what is-or  what should be-wilderness. Wilderness today may have been  created by God, but it is certified by Congress. At present  there are some 19 million acres of congressionally-designated  wilderness. More than 15 million acres of this is in our  national forest system under the Department of Agriculture.  Somewhat less than 4 million acres is under jurisdiction of  the Department of the Interior. Also pending before Congress  5  are proposals endorsed by the Administration which would  add 23 million acres to the wilderness system.  Just last week, President Carter announced he will  recommend that more than 15 million acres of national forest  land be added to the wilderness system. Another 10 million  acres will be given further study. Some 36 million acres  would be made available for multiple use. These recom­mendations  come from the Roadless Area Review and  Evaluation, ""RARE II"" in popular parlance, conducted  by the USDA Forest Service.  The Administration's latest recommendations would  bring to 3.4 million acres the amount of Federal land in  Idaho which has been proposed for addition to the wilderness  system. The President's announcement last week would mean  another 230,000 acres for the proposed River of No Return  Wilderness, increasing the proposal to 2.16 million acres.  At this time we have relatively little acreage officially  in the National Wilderness System. There are only 19 million  acres of designated wilderness out of some 760 million acres  under Federal jurisdiction. That is less than 3 percent.  Even if Congress were to approve all currently recom­mended  wilderness areas, even if we were to add 50 million  acres of wilderness in Alaska, if the areas recommended for  wilderness classification in RARE II were to be added, and  if all the areas recommended for further study as part of  RARE II were eventually put into wilderness-if all of these  actions were taken, there still would be only about 118  million acres of wilderness-less than 7 6 percent of the 760  million federally-owned acres in America.  To put it into a much more meaningful context, it is  only about 5 percent of the 2.3 billion acres which make up  the gross area of the United States. Five percent is precious  6  little to set aside for the regeneration of the natural world  essential to maintain a planet worth living on.  Let me emphasize my belief that it is in the best interest  of the wilderness movement that we expedite actions which  will clear the way for development of natural resources in  areas where wilderness characteristics do not exist. We must  continue intelligent development of America, but on what  lands, is the question.  There is suspicion among many that people who are  pro-wilderness must be anti-development. There is a suspicion  that some people opposed to all types of energy development  and other economic activity are misusing the wilderness  program to slow economic development. There is a belief-!  see it in the mail every day and hear it almost everywhere I  travel-that there is a bunch of people out there who somehow  want to force us all to return to a cave-dweller era.  Although I haven't researched it carefully, I will say that  there appear to be two types of humans who try to makeup  in clamor what they lack in numbers. One of these is the  ""Neo-caveman,"" who would bring all economic development  to a halt. The other is the ""Hyper-economan,"" who would  sacrifice the last tree, the last unscarred landscape, the last  pure water, the last non-human creature (and perhaps even  some human creatures) in his obsession with development  and his satanic vision of progress.  Between these two extremes lie the vast majority of  Americans who want a decent standard of living and feel'  there must be economic development of natural resources,  but who also are beginning to grasp the importance of wild  areas and of the need to save enough of the natural world to  maintain human life itself. Although many of these people  may never backpack into the wilderness, they have come to  appreciate and enjoy it, just by knowing it's there.  7  ""Getting It All Together""  So far, I have dwelled on the evolution of a new land  ethic in America. With our maturity have come a series of  programs which improve the way in which we use and care  for our natural resources. Especially during this past decade,  there have been a series of laws and actions which have estab­lished  a strong conservation ethic.  But something is missing. Harking back to our analogy  of national growth and human growth-a mature, experienced  and well-intentioned person remains at a serious disadvantage  in life if he is disorganized. The successful person has to be  able to ""get it all together."" Likewise, our Federal policy for  management of natural resources, to be fully efficient, effec­tive,  comprehensive and coordinated, must be well organized.  We must be able to ""get it all together.""  At present, Federal organization for managing our  natural resources is scattered, cumbersome and wasteful.  This is especially evident in our land management agencies  which are housed in two different departments. On one hand,  this·arrangement creates barriers to the formation of compre­hensive  national policy. On the other hand, it creates dupli­cation  of effort, inconsistency of regulations, and lack of  coordination. This is frustrating to individuals who want to  use the resources; frustrating to state and local officials who  must deal with the Federal agencies; frustrating to taxpayers  who demand efficiency in government; and most of all,  frustrating to everyone who believes government should be  responsive to the mandate of the people.  Let's talk specifically about why a Department of  Natural Resources as proposed by President Carter would  improve wilderness programs. The most important benefit  8  would be the existence-at long last-of one department  which could provide an integrated, coordinated national  policy for the creation and preservation of wilderness areas.  We would no longer have to cope with complex natural  resources issues through a patchwork of agencies created in  earlier times in response to problems of the past.  What we are proposing is to put all of these agencies  under a Department of Natural Resources (DN R). Then we  will provide an internal structure in this department which  will closely coordinate all the Federal land management  policies. Federal policy would be strong and clear, but pro­gram  responsibilities would be carried out with the maximum  possible decentralization so that Federal officials in the field  don't have to turn to Washington for every decision.  User groups have been yelling that the time has come to  decide how much wilderness is enough. They have viewed the  Forest Service RARE II as having marched along, cutting  them off from timber, mineral and other resources they feel  are vital to their own well-being and to the nation. Now they  see the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) setting out on  its wilderness review, marching to its own drummer. They  want to know who is calling the tune. And rightly so.  With DN R we will have a focal point; we will have one  department where we can establish a policy and a rationale  for it. If the policy displeases industry, industry will know  where to place the blame. And just as industry has a ""target""  to draw a bead on if it feels shorted, so do conservationists,  preservationists, environmentalists and the like.  It is obvious that it would have been much preferred to  have the Forest Service and the BLM wilderness reviews pro­ceed  at the same time and in concert rather than independ­ently.  Although we are making attempts at coordination,  there are instances where the Forest Service process and our  own process are at odds.  9  With reorganization the two agencies will be brought  together in a single administration. They will be able to  develop united review methods and criteria for recom­mendations  on wilderness suitability. This will simplify the  process for consideration of citizen and congressional sugges­tions  regarding recommendations for contiguous roadless  areas.  The Alaska Case  With reorganization we will be able to achieve that  elusive ""balance"" we talk so much about-the balance between  development and preservation, the balance among the various  degrees of protection needed to save land and wildlife. We  have an outstanding example of how this can be achieved  when one agency is clearly in charge. The Administration's  program for Alaska National Interest Lands is, we think, a  case study in balancing competing objectives. Almost all  land in Alaska would qualify as ""wilderness"" under either the  legal or colloquial definition of the word, so the debate has  never been over the wilderness quality of the land.  Early recommendations for wilderness protection in  Alaska went unheeded because the region was sufficiently  protected by its remoteness, climate and the cost of doing  business there. With Alaska statehood in 1959 it became  clear that the days of the Alaska frontier were coming to an  end. Congress awarded the new state of Alaska 104 million  acres as its statehood grant-that is larger than the state of  California-28 percent of its land compared with the 7 per­cent  Idaho received when it became a state.  Among the first land selected by the state of Alaska  was the site of the Prudhoe Bay oilfield. The discovery of  the largest American oilfield at Prudhoe in 1968 set off a  series of reactions that suddenly brought Congress face to  10  face with the reality that Alaska's wilds were no longer  impervious to outside influence.  In 1971 Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act, which granted 44 million acres to Alaska's  natives. At the same time, Congress directed the Secretary  of the Interior to study the public lands in Alaska and make  recommendations for additions to the national conservation  systems-national parks, wildlife refuges, wild and scenic  rivers and national forests. Congress gave itself until mid­December  of last year to act on those recommendations.  The proposals we developed in 1977 for 92.5 million  acres of new conservation areas, including about 50 million  acres of new legal wilderness, were the product of three  fortunate and interlocking sets of circumstances:  -First, the Interior Department was able to work as a  single management unit on the majority of proposals  from beginning to end.  -Second, the Department was able to call upon years of  research done in the hope that such an opportunity for  its use might occur, as well as research done specifically  to make sure that our recommendations were accurate  and up to date.  -Third was President Carter's strong commitment to an  integrated approach to assure this would be a model of  the way resource conservation and development work  ought to be done.  Using the resources of the National Park Service, the Fish  and Wildlife Service, the Heritage Conservation and Recreation  Service, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Land  Management, we were able to marshal the most complete  picture of Alaska's resources ever put together. Because the  Carter Administration has a deep commitment to conser­vation,  we were able to work closely with the Forest Service  11  to develop proposals for national forest wilderness in south­east  Alaska. We feel that the 7.6 million acres of national  forest wilderness that we seek will not harm the existing  timber industry of Alaska, and that it is essential to continued  existence of the important Alaska coastal fishing industry.  Of course, there were some coordination problems in  developing these proposals in two different Cabinet level  departments, no question about it. That is one reason why I  am such an enthusiastic supporter of the DN R concept. I am  convinced that if this work had been spread among more  agencies it might still be going on. In agovernmentassprawling  as ours, there is simply no way to coordinate a multitude of  agencies and departments in a way that will be both timely  and reasonable unless they are under one umbrella.  When Congress failed to meet its own 1978 deadline for  protection of Alaska's crown jewels, the President and I  were forced to exercise our administrative authority. Using  the Antiquities Act of 1906 and land withdrawal authority  previously granted to the Secretary of the Interior, we have  protected the best of our Federal lands. Meanwhile, Congress  is working on legislation once again. Early committee action  has not been encouraging, but I am confident that Congress  will enact a bill which will provide the wilderness, parks,  refuges, wild and scenic rivers and national forests we need to  protect the vital natural areas of this magnificent state.  Congress also will soon have its opportunity to review the  President's proposal for a Department of Natural Resources.  Wilderness Would Benefit  In describing the progress of the wilderness movement,  and in describing our program for Alaskan lands, I have tried  to illustrate some of the benefits which would come through  a Department of Natural Resources. We would have coor­dinated,  consistent and efficient programs and policies to  decide which areas should be designated as wilderness. We  would eliminate situations where actions by one agency on  12  land it manages impair the wilderness potential of adjacent  or nearby land administered by another Federal agency. We  will be able to actually manage our Federal land and its  resources rather than to continue playing a guessing game with  each agency pursuing its own goals.  I look forward to the day when our governmental  structure is such that we can draw all the necessary data  together, fully analyze the range of conservation and preser­vation  programs, assess the economic sacrifice of wilderness,  assess the economic and environmental benefit of wilderness,  and assess the environmental costs of sacrificing potential  wilderness to various forms of development. We must be able  to study the interrelationships of the areas, of the natural  elements of the areas, of the many environmental and  economic impacts of various combinations of decisions.  Until we have the organizational framework to assemble  this data, to analyze this data, and to propose comprehensive  policies and programs based on these findings, we will con­tinue  to literally wander through the wilderness, our fate  left to uncoordinated decisions based sometimes on fact  and sometimes on emotion, but lacking relevance to the total  needs of man, society and nature.  Finally, I would point out that there are obvious benefits  for wilderness management in having one department respon­sible  for all Federal land management. We can be assured that  there will be consistent management policy for all designated  wilderness areas. We can see to it that Federal nonwilderness  areas adjacent to designated wilderness are managed appro­priately.  A Department of Natural Resources enhances our  ability to save the resources we are trying to protect when we  establish a wilderness area.  13  Summary and Predictions  Ladies and gentlemen, at one time human accomplish­ment  was measured almost solely by progress in conquering  nature. At one time, a person setting out to make his mark  in the world was measured by the physical mark he could  make on the world. Today we must be as concerned with  protecting as with conquering nature; we must do our best to  make our mark in the world without leaving a mark on the  world.  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote:  Lives of great men all remind us  We can make our lives sublime,  And, departing, leave behind us  Footprints on the sands of time. 4  If I could choose two footprints for my generation to  leave on the sands of time, one of them would be a balanced  program for the development of needed natural resources and  for the protection of irreplaceable scenic and wildlife areas in  Alaska. The other footprint would be a logical organization  in our Federal government to effectively manage our natural  resources-land and sea-during the final two decades of this  century and well into the next.  If we take these steps, we will be taking giant strides  toward preservation of a rich natural heritage.  If we take these steps, we will be establishing the  machinery through which we and those who follow can  become better stewards of this land and its many resources.  If we take these steps, I will rest satisfied and confident  that we have done our best when that time comes-as it does  to each generation-to pass the torch to the next.  14  15  Notes  7 Cahn, Robert. 19.78.

Preserving America's Natural Heritage: The Decade of the Eighties,Patrick F. Noonan,"Lecture given by Patrick F. Noonan former President of The Nature Conservancy. Introduction by Dr. Ernest D. Ables: Associate Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center at the Univeristy of Idaho. The lecture opens with a brief history of conservation as an idea in the United States and the current state of urbanization and pollution as well as predictions of urbanization in the future. The lecture goes on to describe the current attitude towards conservation and the environment in the 1980's and how that attitude is beginning to change. The lecture also touches on the education of real estate developers about conservation, that is to say, little or none. The attitude to shift is viewing the land as a commodity, to viewing it as a resource. It highlights the tension between the need for both urban growth and conservation in the future, an interdisciplinary effort. The lecture outlines some of the most pressing problems for conservation in the 80's. Another perspective change is the percieved value of the 'free work' of nature, and how to evaluate the economic value of nature as it exists as a whole, not just it's resources. The lecture closes with a commendation to organize and to work together to continue to make conservation more efficient in the future.

ABLES  I want to welcome you this evening to the 4th  annual Wilderness Distinguished Lectureship. We in the  state of Idaho live in an area that is richly blessed with  wilderness resources, and it is for this reason that the  University of Idaho has instituted the Wilderness Research  Center which is sponsoring tonight's lecture.  Although wilderness is often thought of as an expan­sive,  roadless tract of land run by some government  agency, it is heartening to realize that a private, non­profit  organization, The Nature Conservancy, has been  devoted to the task of preserving ecologically significant  lands more than 1 0 years before the passage of the Wilder­ness  Act in 1964.  Mr. Patrick Noonan, who until the end of last month  served as president of The Nature Conservancy, is with us  this evening. Mr. Noonan has worked in private practice  as a land planner, and also served as Senior Park Planner  for the Maryland National Park and Planning Commission.  Holding advanced degrees in both city and regional plan­ning  and business administration, he is also a licensed real  estate broker and professional land appraiser. A member of  the American Society of Planning Officials and of the  American Institute of Planners, Mr. Noonan is a senior  member of the American Society of Appraisers and holds  membership in a number of regional and national conser­vation  organizations. In 1974 he was a recipient of an  American Motors conservation award in the professional  category. He also serves on the Advisory Board of the  Duke University School of Forestry.  As a Life Member of The Nature Conservaflcy,  Mr. Noonan continues to be active in its programs, and is  working to publish a history of The Nature Conservancy  in time for its 30th anniversary in 1981. The remarkable  success of the Conservancy is due in no small part to the  diligent work of Mr. Noonan, who served as its president  since 1973. Under his direction, the Conservancy's land  conservation activity quadrupled to the present level of  200 projects per year.  But rather than b~sk in past accomplishments,  Mr. Noonan will speak tonight on preserving America's  natural heritage in the decade of the eighties.  It is my distinct pleasure to introduce Mr. Patrick F.  Noonan.  Dr. Ernest D. Ables is Associate Dean, College of Forestry,  Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director, Wilderness  Research Center, University of Idaho.  ii  - -~---- ·-  iii  iv  PRESERVING  AMERICA'S  NATURAL HERITAGE:  THE DECADE OF  THE EIGHTIES  Patrick F. Noonan  W who live in America are blessed, for we have in­herited  from the good Lord a beautiful and bountiful  land. We have an abundance of natural resources, an  unparalleled diversity, and an economic system based  on individual initiative and enterprise. This land which  brought our forefathers here as a land of opportunity con­tinues  to beckon new residents daily.  Today, we live in very exciting times: times of  tremendous environmental awareness and also times of  awesome environmental degradation. Yet conservation is  not new. I'd like to share with you a quotation: ""The  conservation of natural resources is our fundamental  problem. Unless we solve that problem, it will avail us  little to solve all others. To solve it, the whole nation must  undertake the task through their organizations and asso­ciations,  through the men and women whom they have  made especially responsible for the welfare of the states,  and finally through Congress and the executive.""  The source? President Theodore Roosevelt, October 4,  1907, in preparation for the historic conference of state  governors on conservation. He called the conference to  focus on the future of our natural resources. That con­ference  is generally recognized as the formal beginning  of the conservation movement in America.  And where are we less than 75 years after President  Roosevelt's warning that the conservation of natural  resources is the fundamental problem in America?  Today the Environmental Protection Agency tells us  that 3000 acres of prime wildlife habitat are lost to  development each day. An estimated twenty million  acres will be urbanized by the year 2000. This amounts to  over one million acres of land each year.  Interestingly, in 1940, there were over 40,000 farms  in Massachusetts alone. Do you know how many farms are  in Massachusetts today, some 40 years later? 3600. In every  state, prime farmland is being converted at the rate of 12  square miles a day.  In the last couple years, we taxpayers-you and 1-  have spent over 5 billion dollars in disaster aid-federal tax  dollars for disaster aid-and 90 percent of the reason  this aid was needed was overbuilding in flood plains in  flood-prone areas. And yet we have a flood insurance  program that pays the flood-stricken to rebuild in the  exact same spots.  Today, every major east-coast river has been polluted,  among them the Kennebeck, Hudson, Potomac, and Chat­tahoochee;  and, according to the scientists, these rivers  are slowly becoming death systems for our oceans. The  2  James River in Virginia-and this is particularly disheart­ening  to me because I come from Virginia-a magnificent  resource for generations of Virginians, was recently the  subject of Kepone poisoning. Scientists have just finished  their studies of the results of that Kepone poisoning, and  they estimate it will be two centuries before the James  River is free of contamination. And there is no known  solution at this time. There is nothing we can do.  A recent estimate for clean up-even if we knew how  to clean it up- is close to 3 billion dollars. That is the  legacy that we leave to future generations of Virginians,  that I leave to my children's children's children.  The lovely Housatonic River in Connecticut, one of  the finest eastern trout streams, is now off-lim its to fishing  because of PCB contamination in recent years. And the  Love Canal in New York-you've read about that-is a  monstrous hazardous wastes site that will cost 100 million  dollars, your tax dollars, to clean up.  The Environmental Protection Agency now estimates  that there are 30,000 hazardous wastes sites in this country.  What an expense to bear when you realize what it will  cost in taxpayer dollars to restore and clean up those  sites in the decade ahead.  A Problem of A ttl tude  Why are we where we are in 1980? To begin with, the  single-purpose planning that we've had in this country con­centrates  on growth and industrial development, leaving  conservation to get lost along the way. And, by the way,  let me mention-! do not come from a conservation or  ecology background. I've come out of business schools,  and I've worked in the free enterprise system. What first  got me into conservation was when the trout stream that  I fished in as a boy outside of Washington, the only trout  3  stream we had, became polluted and was no longer a trout  stream. I believe in the free enterprise system. But I also  believe in beautiful natural areas and in clean water and  clean air, and I believe that we all have an obligation to  protect these.  The major cause of our being where we are today is  very simple: our attitude toward land and natural resources.  Traditionally, land in America has been viewed as a com­modity  to be conquered, something to be bartered and  sold. It's interesting that 90 percent of the millionaires in  this country made their money in real estate. And it is  also interesting that in 9000 years of existence the American  Indian lived in harmony with the land, but what have we  as a nation done to that resource in a little over 200  years?  It has been said that Americans need water to drink,  air to breathe, and land to make money. Remember the  New Mexico developers, those lovely individuals from New  York and the East who painted the desert green and put  up green plastic trees and took pictures and marketed the  land through the mail?  We wonder why we have energy shortages, endangered  wildlife, floods, polluted streams and lakes, but we have  only to look at our traditionally negative approach to  conservation for the explanation. We have no one to blame  but ourselves. We are turning this magnificent land, this  beautiful land from sea to shining sea, slowly but surely  into a wasteland. In many cases, development has come  first, and, as I was taught in planning school, conservation  was what was left over to be colored green.  Interestingly enough , in my planning courses I had  not one course in biology or ecology or in the dynamics  of natural systems. This was in the late '60's-not that  long ago. And planning schools are still turning out plan­ners  who do not understand the natural systems, either  forestry or any of the other natural sciences.  4  Unfortunately, some see regulation as the best solu­tion.  I say unfortunately because we have over 150,000  new laws per year in this country-and an average of ten  regulations just to interpret each law. You can imagine  what we've created in our nation's capital. It's an awesome  monster. In many cases, as you know, our land-use controls,  including zoning, are also outmoded and do not relate to  the land itself. And even if we have zoning, over 50 percent  of all land-use decisions in this country are still made  without benefit thereof.  Sometimes I think we are still in the Dark Ages when  it comes to understanding our natural systems and blending  planning and the profit motivation in order to get the job  done in this country.  Toward a New Awareness  But, fortunately, there is a new awareness in America  today. Land is beginning to be seen as a resource and not  as a commodity. I have found in my past ten years as a  professional with The Nature Conservancy that almost  all of us have a common interest in conservation. I have  also seen a change in our attitudes about natural resources  and land that has, in many cases, been forced upon us.  Witness that ""environment"" and ""quality of life"" are now  household words, which they were not when I was a child  growing up in the 'SO's and '60's.  The Chairman of the Xerox Corporation, Mr.  McCulloch, recently wrote in the Harvard Business Review  that whenever he walks through a park or fishes a stream  in a national forest, he says thank you to the individuals  who took the time and effort to set the area aside. The  President of the Society of Real Estate Appraisers said last  year that ""recent changes require the real estate appraiser  to develop ecological awareness, for it can mean the  difference between profit and loss, and in many cases  avert financial ruin.""1  5  And just this past April, Charles Seymour, a profes­sional  MAl appraiser, the highest possible appraiser desig­nation,  wrote the following words in an article titled  ""Outlook for Appraising in the 1980's"": ""Our concept  that development rights come from and run with land  ownership 'up from the bottom' like minerals or crops is  being replaced. It is now possible to view them as coming  'down from the top,' created and allocated by society to  each parcel of land.""2 Then, in a revolutionary statement  for the real estate appraisal profession, he continued, ""This  calls for a change from the view that land is a commodity  to be exploited and traded, into an ethic that regards land  as a resource.' '3  I thought I was reading Aldo Leopold. But this was  Charles Seymour from the appraisal profession. It is a  fascinating turn of events, a flip-flop in terms of how people  look at real estate.  This new awareness is not happening just with  appraisers. A recent survey of business school graduates  asked questions focusing on business and the environ­ment  and had three major results. These results are impor­tant,  for they reflect the attitudes of this country's future  business leaders:  1) Sixty-eight percent, over two-thirds, felt corpora­tions  have a duty to better the quality of life  through nonprofit expenditures.  2} Sixty-eight percent also felt that industry should  be forced to fight pollution more aggressively.  3) Only one-third felt large corporations want to  correct the pollution problems they are causing.  Remember, these are the responses of business school  graduates.  I have enjoyed the pleasure of working with business­men  who share my concern for conservation, but who need  6  the facts so they can act responsibly toward the environ­ment  and toward the shareholders for whom they work.  I would like to share with you a quotation from a  successful businessman and member of my own Board of  Governors at The Nature Conservancy, who recently said:  ""Modern man's proudest works have devastated his most  important inheritance. Almost every triumph of his civili­zation  has been a defeat for the land-the land on which  he lives; the thin, finite covering of his planet upon which  he depends for life itself. For all our wondrous works and  soaring dreams, the process of life is sustained by six  inches of soil and the fact that it rains every now and  then. ""4  That's from a business leader. And there are many,  many business leaders who share that concern, who  believe in the free enterprise system, and who want the  facts.  Our estuaries, wetlands, floodplains, and swamps,  river and lake fronts and productive farms-all are threat­ened  by untimely and, in many cases, purely financially­oriented  development. And, unfortunately, unlike air  and water pollution, the results of land spoilation are  often irreversible; we must live with them for generations  and, in some cases, forever.  We need not go through another decade of conflicts  like those of the '70's. In my judgment, the '70's was a  decade of environmental reaction to the excesses of the  Industrial Revolution and the cumulative effects of pollu­tion.  The '70's was also a decade of major achievement,  with over twenty major pieces of environmental legis­lation  passed at the national level alone. And yet we agonize  now over their application as we begin to apply regulations  to carry out new laws. But conflict is expensive and time­consuming,  and sometimes both sides lose. I hope that we  are now at a more mature stage in environmental manage­ment,  an adult phase. It has taken us almost 75 years  7  from President Roosevelt's foreboding remarks on natural  resources to get here, but new leadership and a new atti­tude  are needed to set our conservation priorities openly  and forcefully.  Growth and Conservation  Growth is a reality and we must accommodate it.  Home builders will tell you that we must rebuild America  in the next 40 years, and we must. There are more people  coming; they need homes; the population projection shows  that we wouldn't level off at today's growth rate even by  the year 2025. Those people must be accommodated.  We cannot become no-growth advocates.  The challenge, then, is to protect our rarest natural  assets while accommodating quality growth. How do we  protect the best of what remains?  I sincerely believe we are coming to the realization  that we are all in this together-birders, industrialists,  hunters, fishermen, even housewives and gardeners. What­ever  our activity, we are interested in conservation and in  meeting the demands of growth.  The solutions require an interdisciplinary effort, for  the problems are complex and require involvement at all  levels of society. Where the conservationists were often  weakest in the past was in being too elitist.  It might be wise to pause here a moment and define  our terms. What is conservation? One of the best definitions  I know of was given by a forester in 1947. That forester  was Gifford Pinchot, who wrote, ""Conservation is the fore­sighted  utilization, preservation, and/or renewal of forests,  waters, lands, and minerals, for the greatest good of the  greatest number for the longest time. ""5  8  I'm personally convinced that one of the greatest  achievements in this new decade will be a complete revolu­tion  in how we as Americans view our lands and natural  resources-not as commodities, but rather as fragile  resources. The days of the ""Wild West"" in land use are over.  There are simply too many people, too many energy  demands on our limited resourc.es. Real estate values more  and more will be decided by the public rather than by  individual landowners, especially if the individual's land  use is not in the public's interest.  In the '80's, conservationists must realize that we can­not  harness growth-we shouldn't try-but we can channel  it. To do this, conservationists will have to be far better  informed. We are in the big leagues now, so lying in front  of the bulldozer won't work. We are in a recession, and  people need jobs.  I am convinced that land conservation and protection  of our heritage can be successful in the '80's only to the  extent that we recognize the great role of America's  private enterprise system and of our unique entrepreneurial  system. We must also recognize that haphazard conser­vation  can be worse than haphazard development. For both  conservation and development, actions must be taken  based on facts rather than emotions.  We must set priorities on areas to be protected and  focus our efforts, rather than trying to save everything  in sight. To do so, we need negative incentives, regulations  and taxes, via legislation, but we also need positive fiscal  incentives to channel growth development.  The problems facing us are truly challenging. Some of  the new and more pressing problems include the following:  1) The problem of acid rain. Over one-half of our  310 national parks and monuments are threat­ened  by acid rain today. One-half of the lakes  above 2000 feet in the Adirondacks are already  9  biologically sterile, and scientists tell us that the  primary cause is acid rain. We have documented  negative impacts from acid rain on fisheries,  forests, and croplands. What is it? What can be  done about it? The Edison Electric Institute,  the umbrella institute for all the utilities, is  reported to have spent 50 million dollars to  start trying to address the problem of acid rain.  2) The problem of hazardous wastes. With an esti­mated  125 billion pounds per year of hazardous  wastes being produced by industry, what are the  disposal solutions?  3) The problem of inholdings in our federal lands,  in our parks, refuges, and forests. Do you know  we have an over-two-billion-dollar inholding  problem, in areas which Congress has authorized  but for which Congress has never appropriated  the dollars? Congress loves to authorize; it  doesn't love to appropriate. This coming fiscal  year the appropriations won't even cover the  inflationary increase in the back-log.  4) The loss to nonagricultural purposes of over 30  million acres of farmland in the last decade.  This constitutes an area the size of Vermont,  New Jersey, and Delaware combined. We are  challenged to feed a growing nation, not to  mention a world population which, as we are  told by experts, will double from today's esti­mated  4.5 billion to 9 billion in your generation.  A New Resources Ethic  What is needed?  An ethic- an attitude that, regardless of profession,  these problems require our interdisciplinary efforts for  solutions, an ethic that recognizes the outdoors as part of  10  our heritage, that we are part of it. I believe we must have  less engineering ingenuity and a little more humility in  dealing with nature, and certainly a far better understanding  of natural systems.  Aida Leopold in 1948 told us in his beautiful writings  that ""Conservation is a state of harmony between men and  land. By land is meant all of the things on, over, or in the  earth. Harmony with land is like harmony with a friend;  you cannot cherish his right hand and chop off his  left .... ""6  He went on to say, ""The outstanding scientific dis­covery  of the twentieth century is not television, or radio,  but rather the complexity of the land organism. Only  those who know the most about it can appreciate how  little we know about it. The last word in ignorance is the  man who says of an animal or plant: 'What good is it?'  If the land mechanism as a whole is good, then every part  is good, whether we understand it or not. If the biota,  in the course of aeons, has built something we like but do  not understand, then who but a fool would discard seem­ingly  useless parts? To keep every cog and wheel is the first  precaution of intelligent tinkering.""7  The Free Works of Nature  One of the real breakthroughs must be a whole new  focus on the free works of nature. What are clean air and  water worth to us? What is a flock of geese at sunset  worth to us in terms of spiritual renewal?  Wilderness to me is a state of mind. It is the tonic we  all must have in our daily lives to restore our physical and  spiritual well-being. I have experienced it in places as small  as a cave in West Virginia, or on a 1 0-acre island off the  Virginia coast, and in many, many other small natural  areas. These small public and pristine natural areas can be,  in their own way and in the number of people they serve,  as important as Yosemite. For in many ways, the best way  11  to preserve wilderness is to preserve more urban open space  to reduce the people pressures, which I assure you will  only increase in the years to come.  We need a far broader understanding of the economics  of resource allocation·. We have treated clean air and  water as free goods. Today we must apply external eco­nomics  to Jearn the value of nature, as we have failed to do  in the past, applying prices only to man-made goods. A  recent example of such an application is the salt marshes  of the South.  Ecologists and economists at the University of Georgia  and Louisiana State University have documented that one  acre of salt marsh at capitalized value is worth 84 thousand  dollars to the public, based upon the free works an acre  of marsh does for society as a nursery ground, a buffer  against floods and erosion, even as a natural sewage treat­ment  system. One acre of marsh can produce up to 1 0 tons  of nutrients per year, vs. two to three tons from a wheat­field  heavily worked with modern equipment.  Yes, we are governed by the price system, and a great  deal more work needs to be done in terms of apptying  dollar values in our traditional approaches to natural  systems.  The fundamental economic aim of our environmental  effort in the '80's must be to improve the quality of  growth in this country. To do this, we must, of course,  encourage the reduction or recovery of the enormous waste  of energy and other resources within our economy-waste  that, in large measure, represents economic as well as  environmental costs. To the degree that clean air and  water, and indeed land itself, have become increasingly  scarce and costly goods and that energy and other materials,  whose extraction, production, and consumption generate  the pollution we are trying to clean up, have themselves  become increasingly_ scarce and costly, it makes both  12  environmental and economic sense to make the conser­vation  of energy and the reduction or recovery of waste  a matter of the highest priority.  Aldo Leopold warned time and again that we must  embrace what he termed a ""simple land ethic."" He cautioned  that we must stop thinking about land-use solely as an  economic problem. He urged that we examine each question  in terms of what is ethically and esthetically right, as well  as what is economically expedient. ""A thing is right,""  Leopold said, ""when it tends to preserve the integrity,  stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong  when it tends otherwise!""  For the '80's, the environmental field has tremendous  needs which require your involvement. Sometimes I think  we need an environmental Peace Corps. Sometimes I think  that environmental ecology should be like reading, writing,  and arithmetic and become the fourth element in our  school systems. We need common-sense solutions that  work with the free enterprise system. We need a far better,  broader public awareness of a new land ethic, where we  view land as a precious resource, not as a commodity. We  need to see ourselves as custodians, not as consumers, of  land. We need to put conservation first, not last, in our  land-use decisions.  Needs In the Eighties  Obviously, we must maintain our regulatory achieve­ments,  but we must also make them far more efficient. This  presents a magnificent challenge for the legal profession.  We must have far better coordination of effort and inter­change  of ideas between the 11 ,000 conservation/environ­mental  groups now in existence. We must have a buy-out  of the 2 billion dollar back-log in authorized federal parks,  refuges, and national forests. We must realize that hap­hazard  conservation can be worse than haphazard develop-  13  ment. We must all come to the realization that we need to  apply economics to conservation efforts.  The key is relatively simple: determine where not to  build, first by making inventories of our best natural areas  and then by channeling growth on areas with adequate  carrying capacity.  The Nature Conservancy has inventories underway in  25 states, listing the very best habitats and critical resource  areas. Many of these inventories are paid for by industry­the  petroleum industry in New Mexico, the timber industry  in Minnesota, the utility industry in Indiana, and so on.  In each case, industry is saying, ""Give us the facts on where  these critical areas are, in advance, before we make new  investments. We don't want to go to court after we've  begun construction; we have a responsibility to our stock-holders.""  ·  I have had the pleasure of working with corporations  both in fund raising and in acquiring land. To date, The  Nature Conservancy has acquired over 200 tracts of land  from corporations. And I have been accused, by some  groups, of accepting tainted money. The first time I was  accused of accepting tainted money, I thought about it  for a few seconds, then passed along Mark Twain's comment:  ""It may be tainted money, but it taint enough.""  Last year, 43 billion dollars were given away in  America: 90 percent from individuals, 5 percent from  corporations, and 5 percent from foundations. Any of  you who are going to be in fund raising should learn  the facts: corporations, for the fourth time last year,  gave away more money than foundations. I believe that  trend will continue through the decade of the '80's,  into the '90's, and on ad infinitum.  Corporations have come to the realization that while  their average giving is less than 1 percent of their taxable  earnings-and they are encouraged to give away up to 5  14  percent-they have an obligation to society and social  responsibility. Many corporations are now actively seeking  ways to contribute funds to projects which seek to balance  economic growth and conservation needs. It's a tremendous  opportunity, in my judgment, to sit across the table and  try to work out common problems with solutions based  upon facts.  I am optimistic about the future of our natural  heritage, in spite of all the problems and challenges. What  gives me my optimism is nature's resilience. Dr. Rene  Dubas, a prominent microbiologist at Rockefeller Uni­versity,  has spoken of the marvels of nature's ability to  cleanse herself if left free from contamination. For  example, he said that if we would leave the Hudson River  alone, free of contamination for 6 or 7 years, it would  restore itself almost to its original condition. We could  swim in it, fish in it, etc. It could be enjoyed as a common  resource for the 8 million plus people of New York City.  Perhaps Theodore Roosevelt said it best when viewing  the Grand Canyon for the first time: ""Leave it as it is,  mankind cannot improve it-he can only mar it.""  I believe the next 20 years will be as different from  today in terms of energy as we today are from when we  became a nation some 200 years ago. The solutions, how­ever,  must come from you, not from Washington, D.C.  As Randy Meyer, President of Exxon, said, ""America  owes its success not so much to physical resources as to  the resou rcefu I ness of [its] people. ""8  I am convinced that individual initiative, if properly  guided and motivated, holds the key to solving our resource  problems, for the free enterprise system is still the greatest  motivator in the world. We need a judicious blend of  planning and profit motivation to solve our natural resource  problems, for history gives ample warnings to a civilization  that ignores the wise use of its natural resources.  15  We are all blessed by a magnificent natural heritage,  a heritage which today is threatened as never before by  mankind itself with its unquenchable thirst for growth  and energy. I sincerely believe that at no time in the history  of our nation have there been more compelling reasons  for your meaningful involvemen-t in the environmental  life and times of our nation. We are truly at an environ­mental  crossroads that over the next 20 years will, I  believe, determine whether future civilizations will praise  our foresight or curse our blindness for the world they  will inherit.  In any cause, and particularly in environmental or  conservation causes in this country, you will find that 1  percent makes things happen, 9 percent watches things  happen, and 90 percent says, ""What happened?"" I hope  that each of you in this audience will be part of the 1  percent that makes things happen. The challenge is yours,  the initiative is yours, the obligation to get involved is  yours. Thank you.  16  :;~~  . ------ ~--- ""-.....  ' ; ) ""-..  , ·' I ' ""-.,.  17  Notes  1 Charles L.

Wilderness Management: A Contradiction in Terms?,Roderick Nash,"Lecture given by Dr. Roderick Nash. Introduction by Dr. John H, Ehrenreich: Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center at the Univeristy of Idaho. Dr. Nash's lecture opens with a bold statement that 'Wilderness does not exist' and is instead 'a state of mind evoked by a state of nature' and then proceeds to define wilderness as seen by the Wilderness Act. He claims that maps have an 'erosive effect on wilderness' and that wilderness used to be 'a circle on a map' that 'concentrated on keeping things like roads and buildings out'. The lecture details how management became a necesity as time went by and more people recreated in the National Parks and Wilderness Areas and that usage 'could damage natural conditions just as severely as lumbering, mining, and commercial grazing.', he emphazises this through the use of visitor statistics. The lecture then explores the idea of a 'carrying capacity  of wilderness, the impact of people on nature.' The main point is summed up, wilderness management is a contradiction in terms, but necessary for there to to be any semblance of wilderness for people to experience; that they must 'manage so that less management is necessary.'

Roderick Nash  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO WILDERNESS RESEARCH CENTER  April 78, 7978  Published in cooperation with the Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station  as Contribution No. 122.  Dean's Introduction  Before I introduce this year's honored speaker, I  would like to thank Dr. James Fazio and the members of  the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center for  making this presentation on our campus possible. And in  case you are not familiar with this unit of the University,  I would like to say a few words about the Center. Under its  auspices, a steering committee of interested faculty members  promotes both ecological and social research for the purpose  of better understanding our precious wilderness resources  and the human experiences associated with them. Studies to  date have included the investigation of such wilderness  wildlife species as the mountain lion, the wolverine, the  marten and the bighorn sheep. In fact, the host of wildlife  studies associated with the Center runs the gamut from our  highly prized elk to the lowly pocket gopher. Other studies  have dealt with the role of fire in the maintenance of ecologi­cal  balance under conditions as natural as possible in our  modern world.  In the social sciences, a major project has been to learn  more about the use of communication as a management  alternative- perhaps one that can even keep Idaho wilder­ness  free from the restrictions and regimentation that have  become necessary in many other areas of the country.  i  Another study has dealt with the identification of research­able  problems associated with our increasingly popular wild  rivers, and yet another has documented the fascinating  history of the Big Creek portion of the Idaho Primitive Area.  In add it ion to research, a second function can be  attributed to the Center. This is in the area of education.  Through the sponsorship of student field trips, exhibits,  publications, and the annual Wilderness Resource Distin­guished  Lectureship, the Center attempts to convey to the  public what is known about the history, ecology and  management of our great wilderness resources.  Last year, the first Distinguished Lectureship was  awarded to Senator Frank Church. As many of you will  recall, the senator's presentation was titled ""Wilderness  in a Balanced Land Use Framework,"" and was based on  his intimate association with the thought and action that  culminated in the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.  Just today I received a letter from Senator Church,  and I'd like to read partofittoyou.  As the date of the Wilderness Research  Center's Second Annual Wilderness  Resource Distinguished Lecture quickly  approaches, I wanted to get in touch  with you to wish you and your staff my  very best for a most successful program.  As you know, john, I fully support  your efforts to sponsor this program  and to create a dialogue on the many  issues surrounding the Wilderness Act.  ii  I have fond memories of my partici­pation  in last year's lecture program  and I wish I could be with you on  April 78th to hear Dr. Nash's presen­tation.  I would appreciate it if you  could pass on my personal regrets to  Dr. Nash and I look forward to receiving  a transcript of his presentation.  This evening, we will again pursue the historical and  philosophical path to understanding this thing we call wilder­ness.  And at this time, it is my great pleasure to introduce  the 1978 Wilderness Resource Distinguished Lecturer,  Dr. Roderick Nash.  Dr. Nash is Professor of History and Environmental  Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His  undergraduate work was completed, magna cum laude,  at Harvard University in 1960. For his graduate work at the  University of Wisconsin, Dr. Nash specialized in the area of  social and intellectual history, and in 1961 he won the  second award in the William P. Lyons National Master's  Essay Competition. Resources for the Future granted him  a· Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship in 1963 and 1964 and  a Faculty Research Grant in 1967.  To our students in the audience, Dr. Nash is perhaps  best known for one of his eight books, and one which will  undoubtedly stand as a classic in its field, Wilderness and  the American Mind. This work was named among the ""Fifty  Best Books"" published in the United States in 1967.  Currently in paperback, it has enjoyed nine reprintings and  appeared as a revised edition in 1973. In reviewing Wilderness  and the American Mind, Supreme Court Justice William 0.  Douglas wrote "" ... this book is a mandatory prelude to  iii  any modern treatment of conservation problems."" Dr. Nash  is also well known for publishing the first collection of  documents relating to environmental history, The American  Environment, in 1968, with a revised edition in 1976.  A national leader in the field of conservation and  environmental management, Dr. Nash played a major role  in Santa Barbara's response to the oil spill of 1969, writing  the internationally publicized Santa Barbara Declaration of  Environmental Rights. His efforts were rewarded in 1971  with presentation of the ""Outstanding Young Man"" award  from the Santa Barbara Junior Chamber of Commerce,  in recognition of distinguished service to the community.  In 1974 Dr. Nash was honored by the American Academy  of Achievement as ""one of 40 giants of accomplishment  from America's great fields of endeavor."" His tribute singled  him out as a ""leading spokesman for environmental quality,  particularly the preservation of wilderness, and for environ­mental  education.""  Wilderness is the setting of most of Dr. !\lash's recrea­tional  as well as his scholarly interests. He was a champion  fly and spin caster, and a professional guide in Ontario and  Wyoming. Currently regarded as one of the most experienced  whitewater boatmen in the American West, he has rowed and  kay a ked more than 10,000 miles on every major Western  river and in Alaska. His speciality is the Grand Canyon of  the Colorado River (Arizona), where he is both an amateur  and professional boatman and a guide for inner canyon  backpacking.  Presently, Dr. Nash is completing a study of the world  nature protection movement and of environmental ethics.  Longer-term projects include a history of the recent environ­mental  movement emphasizing the role of the Sierra Club,  and a futuristic novel exploring human needs for wilderness  and civilization.  iv  Tonight Dr. Nash will look at both the past and the  present as he shares with us his thoughts on the problem  ""Wilderness Management: A Contradiction in Terms?""  It gives me a great deal of pleasure to welcome  Dr. Rod Nash.  Dr. john H.

Roderick Nash  Wderness does not exist. It never has. It is a feeling  about a place; part of the geography of the mind. In an effort  to construct a workable definition we draw lines on maps and  pass complicated laws. We act as if wilderness were real -  rocks, trees, canyons, mountains- but it is actually a state  of mind evoked by a state of nature, a quality associated by  some people with some places. This explains why the condi­tions  under which one visits a place are so crucial to the  so-called wilderness exprience. It also suggests why wilderness  management may be a centrad iction in terms.  The uncontrolled: Dig back far enough into the histori­cal  meaning of ""wilderness"" and that concept emerges as  the essence of any definition. ""Will,"" the root word in early  Teutonic languages of both ""wild"" and ""wilderness,"" meant  chaotic, unruly, disorderly, literally will-full. An angry mob  of people beating at the castle gate was said to be wild­ungovernable,  out of control. So were animals that man  had not domesticated or tamed. The place one found such  uncontrolled animals, called ""deor"" in the old tongues,  was ""wild-deor-ness""- literally the place of wild beasts.  Their presence signified the absence of human control.l  Contemporary meanings of wilderness emphasize the  same concept. When he drafted the Wilderness Act, Howard  Zahniser, executive director of the Wilderness Society, chose  as his principal descriptive adjective an unusual word:  ""untrammeled.""2 When Zahniser began using it in 1956,  everyone assumed his secretary had erred in typing ""un­trampled.""  But Zahniser stood behind his original choice  and with good reason. A trammel, he explained, is a net for  catching wild birds or fish. Alternatively the word signifies  a shackle used to slow the gait of a horse. The central idea  is that of restraint, control, management by man.  Untrammeled means the opposite.  The uncontrolled is unpredictable and therefore  potentially dangerous. An untrammeled horse is a bucking  bronco. In the psychology of wilderness we cannot minimize  the centrality of danger, risk and fear. To be true to the  basic definition, wilderness should be a place where it is  possible to get lost, to become, literally, bewildered (the  root word, ""will,"" is the same). Reducing this possibility  may make a place more pleasant, to some people, but it will  be less wild. For this reason the existence of trails, guide­books,  ranger patrols and well organized search-and-rescue  squads poised to bail out the unlucky or incompetent strikes  at the very essence of wilderness. And since wilderness is a  state of mind, even the knowledge that these things exist  diminishes the wilderness feeling. It is even arguable that  as soon as we label a region wilderness we destroy it as  wilderness.  2  Maps have an especially erosive effect on wilderness  in that they make the unknown known. Aldo Leopold  defined wilderness in 1945 as ""a blank spot on the map. ""3  It was this for Columbus, Lewis and Clark, John Wesley  Powell, and still for Leopold as a young officer of the  United States Forest Service in the New Mexico Territory  in 1909. Presently the United States Geological Survey is  moving inexorably ahead with its intent to publish 15-  and 7.5-minute topographic maps for the last spots in the  48 contiguous states. Alaska is next. The completion of this  monumental task- the reduction of the United States to the  scale of one inch to the mile- will be a just cause for  celebration for that part of ourselves and our culture that  seeks to order, organize, measure and control. But for the  other part (the right side of the brain, psychologists believe)  there is something terribly sad and terribly final about the  end of uncertainty. At least those who understand what  wilderness means cannot rejoice in the prospect of a country  that is totally mapped.  The history of wilderness management is the history of  increasing control over wilderness. But for a half-century  after the establishment of the first reserves, wilderness pre­servation  did not entail wilderness management. It simply  meant designation. You drew a circle on a map as, for  instance, in the cases of Yellowstone National Park (1872)  and the Gila Primitive Area ( 1924), and concentrated on  keeping things like roads and buildings out. No one was  concerned with what people engaged in recreation did in  the wilderness. It was not a matter of oversight- in fair­ness  to the federal land administrators of this era, there  really was little to manage.  Before 1940 very, very few Americans ventured into  the backcountry. It is easy, amidst the widespread touting  3  of wilderness today, to forget that our fathers and grand­fathers  were still very much a part of a frontier-shaped  value system that emphasized conquest of, not communion  with, wild places and things. As we wander the well-stocked  aisles of today's outdoor stores, it is also easy to overlook  how hard it used to be to go off the beaten track for more  than a day or two. Any contemporary backpacking outfit  is largely composed of materials derived from post-World  War II technology- nylon, aluminum, plastics, foam rubber,  freeze-dried foods. Without this equipment revolution,  roughing it, in the parlance of the turn of the century, was  indeed rough and unappealing.  What most outdoor-minded Americans before 1940  wanted was a room with a view - a comfortable lodge from  which to watch wild nature without getting too close. The  first leaders of the National Park Service after 1916,  Stephen T. Mather and Horace M. Albright, never forgot  this in their campaign to make the parks popular. What  emerged in Yosemite, Yellowstone, Glacier and the Grand  Canyon were resorts complete with paved roads, downhill  skiing, putting greens, scheduled feedings of bears with hotel  garbage, the firefall (Yosemite) and colored lights on night  eruptionsofOid Faithful.4 Noone in the 1920sand 1930s  saw these things as incompatible with the national park idea.  Fortunately for wilderness, the ""ci reuses"" were confined to  small areas of the Western parks. The few who did go  into the wilderness in those years, like David R. Brower of  the Sierra Club, could claim a first ascent almost every time  they climbed a peak. For a magic interlude wilderness  management could actually consist of letting things alone.  One of the first indications that this could change  was a 1926 cartoon in the New York Herald Tribune. It  was a before-and-after view of a mountain lake. In the first  4  frame a lone horseman approached the lake, which was  surrounded with pines and full of leaping trout. In the  second view a solid rank of fisherman ringed the lake and  their camps obliterated the scenery.  A decade later Lowell Sumner, a regional wildlife  technician with the National Park Service, made one of  the first official recognitions that wilderness managers  could not rest content with merely setting land aside from  development. In his 1936 report on parks in California's  Sierra, Sumner wondered ""how large a crowd can be turned  loose in a wilderness without destroying its essential quali­ties.""  Sumner was among the first Americans to understand  that if wilderness is to exist in the national parks, the  parks ""cannot hope to accommodate unlimited numbers  of people."" Sumner also understood that wilderness manage­ment  could pose a threat to wilderness values. He urged  that only ""the very simplest maintenance activity"" be  undertaken in wilderness. 5  The Wilderness Society, organized in 1935, initially  reflected the designation-is-enough perspective on wilderness  preservation. The idea was to keep adverse influences out of  wilderness rather than to understand and control what was  happening within its borders. But Robert Marshall, a Wilder­ness  Society founder and the leading advocate of preservation  in the 1930s, quickly perceived that there was an internal  dimension to wilderness protection. As early as 1933,  Marshall's contribution to A National Plan for American  Forestry6 suggested that backcountry campsites could be  overused and urged the education of recreational visitors  in camping etiquette.  In 193 7 Marshall, then Chief of the Division of  Recreation and Lands in the United States Forest Service,  toured the mountains of California with members of the  5  Sierra Club. The party visited high country severely damaged  by the grazing of pack stock and the behavior of campers.  After the trip Marshall requested Joel H. Hildebrand,  president of the Sierra Club, to organize a committee to  advise the Forest Service with regard to wilderness manage­ment.  He wanted to know about the feasibility of distri­buting  and restricting use to the end that ""certain areas may  still be preserved in what might be termed a super-wilderness  condition, or, in other words, kept entirely free even from  trails, in order that a traveler can have the feeling of being  where no one has been before."" 7 For Marshall to pose this  question was understandable, in that he personally coveted  this extreme condition of wildness and had, in fact, found  it in the Brooks Range of Alaska on his explorations of the  late 1920s and early 1930s.  The communications between Marshall and the Sierra  Club in 1937 and 1938 constituted the first recognition that  recreational management of wilderness could threaten  wilderness. The construction of trails was recognized as a  problem for persons who wanted the sense of being in  pristine country. Trail signs and established campgrounds  also came in for criticism, as did the grazing of pack animals  and the cutting of living trees for bough beds and firewood.  The Sierra Club concluded its report by recommending that  high country rangers or guards be appointed to enforce the  rules.8 But neither Marshall nor the Sierra Club then under­stood  that the rangers themselves, and the rules, might also  adversely influence wilderness perception.  In the November 1940 issue of American Forests,  j.V.K. Wagar became the first to raise the possibility of  licensing as a means of controlling the behavior of persons  6  engaged in wilderness recreation. He began by pointing out  that ""nature once certified outdoorsmen"" by weeding out  and killing the weak, foolish and careless. But now anyone  could become a wilderness traveler, and many people were in  the backcountry who did not know how to care for either  themselves or the country. His suggested remedy was the  Certified Outdoorsman. The National Park Service and the  Forest Service would establish tests with the purpose of  determining who was ""safe to leave in the woods."" Once  in possession of his license, the Outdoorsman would  be admitted to wilderness.9 Wagar's proposal, which has  support in some quarters today, has the advantage of making  possible less intense wilderness management due to the fact  that the users are skilled and carefu I. Search-and-rescue  operations, for example, could be curtailed or eliminated.  But the licensing idea strikes at the heart of the idea of  uncontrolled country that is so central to the traditional  meaning of wilderness.  Following the interruption of World War II, the Sierra  Club renewed its interest in wilderness management. The  Club's own outings, which at that time found more than a  hundred persons traveling through the wilderness in one  group, were a focal point. Club leaders were discovering  that excessive recreational use could damage natural condi­tions  just as severely as lumbering, mining and commerical  grazing. One sequence of photographs published in the  194 7 Sierra Club Bulletin showed the stages in the trans­formation  of a lush mountain meadow into an eroded  dustbowl. Discussing the problem under the heading  ""saturation of the wilderness,"" Richard M. Leonard and  Lowell Sumner declared, ""We need a comprehensive techni­que  of use that will prevent oversaturation of wilderness  and still enable people, in reasonable numbers, to enjoy  wilderness. ""1 o Among the management tools discussed  7  were rotation of camp sites, limitation on the length of  stay by one party in the same area, and the use of trans­ported  oats rather than natural grasses for pack stock food.  According to Leonard and Sumner, there already existed  24-hour limits on camping in some Sierra meadows. These  194 7 rules must have been among the earliest such controls  in wilderness management history.  In 1949 the Sierra Club sponsored the first High Sierra  Wilderness Conference. One hundred federal and state  administrators, outing club representatives, and professional  guides and outfitters joined to discuss the proposition that  wilderness could be loved to death. The conferees, in other  words, had the courage to recognize that they were part of  the problem.  A recognizable problem in the 1950s, the crowding of  wilderness reached crisis proportions in the 1970s. Several  factors contributed to the wilderness recreation boom. The  intellectual revolution that transformed wilderness from  cultural enemy to cultural asset was nearing completion. The  nation had grown up from its frontier adolescence. Only  about 3 percent of the 48 states could be considered  wild, and the same amount was paved! For the great  majority of Americans, wilderness was no longer an adversary  to be feared and conquered but a novelty to be sought as a  refreshing antidote to an urban-indus trial I ifestyle and the  controlling weight of an increasingly complex civilization.  If the counterculture of the 1960s had any definable  meaning, it was that the establishment had gone too far with  growth, progress, control and transformation. Nature ac­quired  new appeal. Charles Reich wrote about The Greening  of Americall; Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel sang ""I'd rather  be a forest than a street. ""12  8  Better equipment, and the affluence and leisure to buy  and use it, helped open the wilderness. So did the publicity  generated by the campaign for the Wilderness Act ( 1964) and  the fight to preserve threatened wildernesses such as the  Grand Canyon, the North Cascades and Hells Canyon.  As a result, many Americans no longer thought of the  national parks as resorts near the wilderness but rather  as places to experience wilderness. Throughout the 1960s  biocentrism made headway against anthropocentrism as the  guiding philosophy of national park management.  The proof of the new popularity of wilderness was in  visitor statistics. Every part of the country could supply  evidence, but the most dramatic varieties came from the  ""name"" wildernesses of the West. Mount Whitney, the  highest peak in the United States outside Alaska, is a case in  point. Dominating California's southern Sierra, Mt. Whitney  was first climbed in 1873. On August 4, 1949, a man climbed  the peak with his father. Proudly, they signed the register on  the summit, the sixth and seventh individuals to have done so  that year. On August 11, 1972, the same man climbed Mt.  Whitney with his son. Upon signing the register they noted  with some shock that they were the 259th and 260th persons  on record that day!  Or consider the Grand Canyon in Arizona, where the  280-mile float trip down the Colorado River is the most  intensely supervised wilderness activity in the United States  today. Due to the limited access to the river, a complete set  of visitor statistics exists. They tell an incredible story.  Similar, if not quite so dramatic, statistical portraits could  be drawn for the Middle Fork of Idaho's Salmon River,  Washington's Mount Rainier or New Hampshire's White  Mountains.  9  Travel on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, Arizona  Year Number of PeoEle Year Number of PeoQle  1867 1? 1960 205  1869-1940 44 1961 255  1941 4 1962 372  1942 8 1963-1964 44  1943-1946 0 1965 547  1947 4 1966 1,067  1948 6 1967 2,099  1949 12 1968 3,609  1950 7 1969 6,019  1951 29 1970 9,935  1952 19 1971 10,385  1953 31 1972 16,432  1954 21 1973 15,219  1955 70 1974 14,253  1956 55 1975 14,305  1957 135 1976 13,912  1958 80 1977 11 ,830  1959 120 Estimated 1978 15,000  Faced with this surge in popularity, managers turned to  the idea of carrying capacity. A stockman's term, it  originally referred to the number of head of cattle that could  graze a piece of range without causing its permanent  deterioration. The point, of course, was to keep the number  from exceeding the carrying capacity and ruining the range.  The first American to apply this concept to people  and wild country was Lowell Sumner. In 1942 he wrote an  essay concerning the biological balances in wilderness areas  and urged that visitation be kept ""within the carrying  capacity or 'recreational saturation point.'"" Sumner defined  this as ""the maximum degree of the highest type of recrea­tional  use [that is, minimum-impact camping] which a  wilderness can receive, consistent with its long-term preser­vation.  ""Managers,"" Sumner urged, ""should determine in  advance the probable maximum permissible use, short of  impairment, of all wilderness areas.""l3  10  In 1942 Sumner's main concern was the biological  carrying capacity of wilderness, the impact of people on  nature. It was relatively easy to measure. An eroded meadow  or fished out lake was there for all to see. Much more diffi­cult  to calculate was the psychological carrying capacity  of wilderness, the impact of people on people. But given  the fact that wilderness is a state of mind, this factor may  be the most crucial of all in preserving the experience of  wilderness.  As an aid to understanding psychological carrying  capacity, consider the following satisfaction curves for  three kinds of activity:  c Q)  .~ :0  0 (1:1 a. ~ Q)  1/) ()  ()  1U &lt;(  (/) 0 j  Q; t &gt;  Q) Q)  ..J :c  (1:1 c. Q)  ()  ()  (1:1 c  ::&gt;  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CARRYING  CAPACITY CONCEPT  ' / l/ ,/ /I /'  1 5  I ''',  I I •  I I  '  10 50  City Sidewalk --­Cocktail  Party -­Wilderness  -  ' ' ', ', \  \  \  100 200  Number of People  11  The city sidewalk is an unsatisfactory place (in this case,  frightening) with only a few people in sight. A pedestrian  could be mugged or raped. The presence of more people  raises the curve over the cut-off point and it remains there  until the crowd builds to the point where walking becomes  difficult. The cocktail party is similarly unsatisfactory  with only a few people rattling around a large living room  without much to say to each other. As more guests arrive  the party gets going, but the curve turns down as a sardine­like  situation develops. Wilderness recreation, on the other  hand, is an activity that by definition is more satisfying  at lower densities. Large numbers cannot enjoy solitude  together. The graph suggests that the wilderness visitor can  tolerate other visitors up to a point. Then the wilderness  is no longer wilderness; the psychological carrying capacity  has been exceeded. Of course this cut-off point varies with  the individual, a fact that vastly complicates the task of  the manager attempting to formulate policy.  This same wilderness curve can also depict the impact  of wilderness management on visitor satisfaction if the  horizontal axis is taken to represent increasing amounts of  control. Most visitors are able to accommodate some control  within the limits of a satisfactory wilderness experience. But  as management increases in intensity, satisfaction declines,  because wilderness is supposed to be a place that civilized  man does not control, a place, in fact, to escape from  control, an island of freedom for the individual in an ever  more managed world. For many wilderness users the cut-off  has already been reached in the most heavily managed  wildernesses of the West. The wilderness permit, which first  appeared in 1963 in the Forest Service's Boundary Waters  Canoe Area (Quetico-Superior) as an innocuous research  aid to determine the numbers of visitors, has been upgraded  to an admission ticket. Permit applications must be filed  12  months in advance. The number of applications for the  popular wildernesses greatly exceeds the established carry­ing  capacities, so lotteries are held. Applicants try to cheat  the system; still the chances of drawing out a permit for a  noncommercial, do-it-yourself trip have declined in places  like the Grand Canyon to approximately 1 in 20. This is,  to be sure, an extreme case, but the era of driving to a  roadhead, parking your car and taking off into the back­country  is definitely over, and with it ends much of what  wilderness once meant.  Even with a permit in hand, control does not end.  ""No substitution"" rules, in force in the Grand Canyon and  on the Salmon River, require rangers to check drivers'  licenses or birth certificates for each member of a party.  Then there is the frequently-encountered practice of assign­ing  campsites. For many wilderness users this is the final  back-breaking straw. Their itineraries must be rigid. The  wilderness is managed as a motel: check out and allow the  next group to occupy the site. Extremes have also been  reached in the regulation of camping procedure. Open wood  fires are on their way out as part of a wilderness experience.  In the proposed management plan for the Grand Canyon  river trips, permitees are required to carry out all human  sewage- for a party of up to 40 for a 2-week trip! Rangers  presumably will check the containers at the end of the trips  to see that regulations have been observed. For many this  would be the ultimate indignity- to people and to the idea  of wilderness.  If the recent history of wilderness management contains  reason for concern, the future looms dark with problems.  The interesting scenario of William C. Leitch entitled ""Back­packing  in 2078"" assumes, quite plausibly, that in the next  13  century electronic technology, world population and wilder­ness  popularity will continue to grow at their recent rates.  Leitch envisions a global, computerized reservation-permit  system that tells his hypothetical applicant that he may  take an 11-night trip 3 years after his application. He had,  after all, enjoyed a 3-week wilderness trip 4 years before.  When the applicant appears at the appointed time and  place, he is issued a tiny transmitting device that  informs rangers back at headquarters where he is at all  times during his trip. He is also issued a small plate to imbed  in his boot heel, to aid in search-and-rescue, but his Mayday  attachment can summon a helicopter in half an hour. The  large animals in the hypothetical park also have transmitting  devices so that, say, human-bear interactions can be avoided.  At headquarters it is like a giant game of chess.14  The near-absolute control over the ""wilderness"" does,  Leitch points out, guarantee the visitor a solitary experience.  His itinerary is planned so he will encounter no other person  for his allotted stay. Moreover, the natural resources in the  park are in excellent condition, nearly undisturbed. The  park of 2078, in short, is a management triumph; the only  trouble is that the wilderness is dead -the victim of human  control.  The Leitch scenario, to which anyone familiar with  wilderness recreation could add, underscores the terrible  dilemma of wilderness management today. The managers  have to manage. If they don't, crowds quickly eliminate any  vestige of solitude and the resource itself is damaged. But  the very fact of management destroys the essence of wilder­ness.  Awareness that wilderness management is indeed a  contradiction in terms, but at the same time a necessity if  anyone is to have any semblance of a wilderness experience,  14  is a prerequ1s1te to enlightened planning for the future.  Wilderness managers are not bad guys. Things would be worse  without them. But in controlling wilderness they might  attempt to be as unobtrusive as possible. What this means is  that the element of risk, the presence of danger and mystery,  should be cherished and protected. Better to have an  occasional backpacker killed by a bear than to put transistors  in every moving thing in the backcountry along the lines of  the Leitch forecast. Better to reduce visitation than to  institute mandatory carrying out of human feces. Better to  require wilderness licenses as evidence of minimum-impact  camping skill than to send waves of patrolling, ticket-writing  rangers through the mountains and down the canyons. Better  to have some visitors get lost than to have signs at every trail  crossing. Better to give self-guided but well trained and  properly equipped parties precedence over commercially  outfitted and guided safaris in allocating limited time in  wilderness. If that means some people cannot make a trip,  tough. The ability to write a check to a professional guide  is no substitute for physical, intellectual and psychological  preparedness. Let those who want to go badly enough com­pete  and qualify as they do, for instance, for state  universities, rather than buy their way into wilderness.  The point is to manage so that less management is  necessary. Upon this seemingly simple yet enormously  difficult principle hangs the fate of everything the wilder­ness  preservation movement has tried to achieve. The sad  alternative is to have wilderness that is not wild.  15  16  Notes  1 The discussion here, and at several other points that  follow, is based on the author's Wilderness and the American  Mind (revised edition, Yale University Press, New Haven,  CT, 1973) and on his ""Historical Roots of Wilderness  Management,"" chapter 2 in John Hendee, Robert C.

"Wilderness: Promises, Poetry, and Pragmatism",Jay D. Hair,"Lecture given by Dr. Jay D. Hair, President of the National Wildlife Federation. Introduction by Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe, Director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lecture opens by touching on three aspects of the wilderness debate: Promises, Poetry, and Pragmatism. The promises section opens with the history of The Wilderness Act, and how it is only until recently that wilderness has been viewed as 'a vital part of civilization'. The poetry section looks to shed light on why we need wilderness using excerpts of poetry from two poets. The last section, pragmatism, explains how the problems of conserving wilderness are growing more complex and so our perspectives should grow as well. Mass exctinction is addressed as a large problem, and not just a poetic problem, a pragmatic one, that affects the scientific community, not to mention the economy. An example of scientific research is given to emphasize the importance of long term scientific research. Statistics are shared to highlight the global pharmaceutical industries releiance on wilderness, and Idaho's dependence on wilderness to fuel the local tourism industry. Emphasis is laid, once again, on the importance of long term scientific research in wilderness. The lecture compares President John Kennedy's push to land a man on the moon to the possibility of creating an inventory of the earth's resources. The lecture continues with a challenge to ask the right questions when doing research, to organize our efforts and relate the research to other science and socioeconomic research, forming a complete picture. Lastly the lecture challanges us to have a new attitude towards research, to let it be chaotic, controversial, and moved into the sphere of politics and lawmaking quickly. Bibliography included.

Illustrations by Lorraine Ashland  Introduction  Edwin E. Krumpe  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the eighth  in the annual series of Wilderness Resource Distinguished  Lectureships sponsored by the University of Idaho Wilderness  Research Center. The Center's mission is to promote research  and educational activities to further our understanding of  wilderness and natural ecosystems and man's relationships to  them. Our goal is to gain knowledge that can be applied to  better manage our designated wilderness areas so that the  public can enjoy sustained use and benefits from our  wilderness resources.  It seems appropriate to give you some background to this  lectureship. It was conceived in 1971 when Senator Frank  Church asked his young Congressional Fellow to contact the  College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences in Idaho to  explore some means to create a better dialogue and look for  ways that wilderness can be brought into a balanced land use  management framework. The Congressional Fellow was John  C. Hendee, who now serves as the dean of the college. The  concept that was developed through contacts with the college  and interactions with Senator Church was to initiate a  lectureship series, and Senator Church would be the first of  the Distinguished Lecturers. The past seven lecturers read like  a who's who in the American conservation movement: Frank  Church, Roderick Nash, Cecil Andrus, Patrick Noonan,  Russell Dickenson, Michael Frome, and Brock Evans.  We continue this tradition tonight with Dr. jay D. Hair,  President of the National Wildlife Federation. Dr. Hair is the  world's leading conservation executive, heading the largest  conservation organization in existence today. The National  Wildlife Federation is five times larger than the nearest  competing group; it has 4.6 million members and an annual  budget of 60 million dollars.  In addition to his demonstrated leadership capabilities,  Dr. Hair has scientific and scholarly credentials in the field to  which he provides leadership and direction. He holds  Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in zoology. From 1977  to 1981 he was professor and administrator of the Fisheries  and Wildlife Sciences Program at North Carolina State  University. He was also a part-time Special Assistant with the  U.S. Department of the Interior, where he was responsible for  coordinating the development of a national fish and wildlife  policy. Since he joined the National Wildlife Federation in  May 1981 as Executive Vice President, he has earned respect  as a proponent of a reasoned and balanced approach to  wildlife conservation and wilderness issues in America. We  are indeed honored to have Dr. jay D. Hair with us tonight as  our Wilderness Resource Distinguished lecturer.  Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe is the Director of the University of  Idaho Wilderness Research Center.  ; ;  WILDERNESS:  PROMISES, POETRY,  AND PRAGMATISM  Jay D. Hair  deeply appreciate this opportunity to talk about  wilderness to an audience surrounded every day by grand  vistas and the grand issues that are their constant  companions.  Today, Idaho has 3.8 million acres of federally designated  wilderness. Still at stake are approximately eight million acres  of roadless National Forest land that is eligible for wilderness  designation. That is more potential wilderness than in any  state except Alaska, and it is the cause of a great deal of  debate. But Idaho is not alone.  Across the country, the debate about what to designate as  wilderness is one of the most dramatic arguments on the  environmental front. The incalculable value of our natural  legacy, the grandeur of wilderness, the economic impact of  protection are all elements in that debate. That is why I have  titled this presentation ""Wilderness: Promises, Poetry and  Pragmatism:' Let me look at each of those aspects one at a  time. First the promises.  Promises  By the time this nation turned its ingenuity to the  protection of wilderness, it had nearly completed its conquest  of wilderness. American pioneers, like people since Biblical  times, fought the ""wilderness"" in a relentless drive for  civilization. In a way they succeeded: When the 1890 United  States Census was taken, the· frontier land was officially  declared ""gone:'  Only in the last few decades - in the decades of Bob  Marshall, Glaus Murie, Aldo Leopold and others- have we  at last realized that wilderness is a vital part of civilization.  We finally comprehended that as we had conquered the  wilderness, we had really destroyed a unique component of  our natural heritage. By the 1960s, we fully realized our loss  and began to accept our responsibility to protect the few wild  places still untouched across our nation. So began the long  and successful drive for passage of The Wilderness Act.  The Act was rewritten 66 times before it was finally  passed by Congress and signed by President Lyndon johnson  on September 3, 1964. As you probably know, Idaho's late  Senator Frank Church, a distinguished statesman and the  lecturer for this series in 1977, was the Congressional floor  manager for this landmark piece of legislation.  In passing the Wilderness Act, Congress sought to assure  citizens that 11an increasing population accompanied by  expanding settlement and growing mechanization, does not  occupy and modify all areas within the United States:' The  legislation attempted - and I quote - to ""secure for the  American people of present and future generations the  benefits of an enduring resource:' And it recognized the value  2  of areas ""where the Earth and community of life are  untrammeled by man - where the imprint of man's work is  substantially unnoticeable:'  The goals were lofty. The promises were broad. But have  they been kept?  Today, the National Wilderness Preservation System  contains more than 88 million acres of world-class resources.  It is the largest system of wild lands protection in the world,  and the envy of other nations.  Nonetheless, wilderness covers less than four percent of  the United States' total land mass. It is far less than we need.  And it is far less than we promised to the American people  when the Wilderness Act was signed. But even as we  acknowledge that, we must ask: Why wilderness? Why should  we maintain areas where humans and their works do not  dominate the landscape? Earlier, I promised you poetry, and  in poetry we find some answers.  Poetry  But I'm not a poet. I'm a scientist and a conservationist.  So let me use the words of others who have captured  America's deep need and love for wild places and wild  things. First, let me quote from C. W. McCall, who is best  known for such Country-and-Western hits as ""Convoy"" and  ""Wolf Creek Pass:' In his poem, ""Wilderness;' he says:  Wake with me and feel the misty blue dawn,  Come hear the wild bird sing her morning song,  See the sun that only wilderness sees.  Then walk with me and let your heart be free.  And he continues:  Come with me and see the river run wi I d.  Come hear the canyon call her wandering child.  Breathe the air that only wilderness breathes.  Then walk with me and let your heart run free.  And now let me quote from Robert Service, the Eng I ish­born,  Canadian poet who immortalized the Yukon Gold Rush  3  days. One of his best known poems is ""The Call of the Wild:'  In that poem, he says:  Have you gazed on naked grandeur where  there's nothing else to gaze on,  Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,  Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the  blinding sunsets blazon,  Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?  Have you swept the visioned valley with the  green stream streaking through it,  Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?  Have you strung your soul to silence? Then  for God's sake go and do it;  Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.  Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush  desolation, ...  Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped  o'er the ranges,  Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and  through?  Have you chummed up with the mesa? Do you know its  moods and changes?  Then listen to the Wild - it's calling you.  And the last verse has a message for all of us:  They have cradled you in custom, they have  primed you with their preaching,  They have soaked you in convention through and through;  They have put you in the showcase; you're a credit to  their teaching -  But can't you hear the Wild? - it's calling you.  Let us probe the silent places, let us see what I uck  betide us;  Let us journey to a lonely land I know.  There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's  a star agleam to guide us,  And the Wild is calling, calling ... let us go.  In fact, statistics indicate that more and more of us are  answering the call of the wild. Why? Because in the wild, we  find ourselves. In the wilderness, we find our links to  yesterday and to eternity. Nonetheless, we still haven't done  enough to protect that heritage. When it comes to the issue  4  of wilderness, we, like the renowned American poet Robert  Frost, '~ .. have promises to keep and miles to go before [we]  sleep:'  Pragmatism  So far I've given you the promises and the poetry of  wilderness. Now it's time for pragmatism. It's time to discuss  the problems we face in a world growing more complex with  each passing day. And it's time to expand the scope of this  presentation.  Every environmental issue needs to be put into a larger  perspective. While the focus of a given issue may be local,  we must always remember that it is just one part of a set of  global concerns.  So let me put the issue of wilderness into its global  context: We live in a· world where an unprecedented number  of people are well fed, well clothed and well housed. Yet, we  also live in a world where as many as 100 thousand people  starve to death each day.  We live in a world of opulence, a world where last week  a japanese firm spent 40 million dollars for one Van Gogh  painting. Yet, we also live in a world where more than 800  million people live in conditions the World Bank describes as  ""absolute poverty - life degraded by disease, illiteracy,  malnutrition and squalor:'  We live in a world in which we consume well over a  third of total terrestrial photosynthetic productivity.1 And we  live in a world in which, for the first time in the history of  civilization, every human being is in contact with potentially  dangerous chemicals from the moment of conception to the  time of death.  The complexities and contradictions of contemporary  society are evident in other ways as well. For example, in  recent years, society has made stunning technological  advances in medicine, space exploration, global  communication systems and agricultural productivity. Our  5  learning curve is so advanced that, at any given moment, we  can measure the distance between the Earth and the moon -  which is almost a quarter of a million miles- and be off by  less than half-an-inch. That is an amazing accomplishment.  Yet, what we don't know is even more amazing.  For instance, we don't know how many species of life  share this planet with us humans. According to E. 0. Wilson  of Harvard University, ""We do not know, even to the nearest  order of magnitude:' 2  We know that about 1.7 million species have been  formally named since Linnaeus inaugurated the binomial  system of scientific nomenclature in 1753. In the 1960s and  '70s, a few scientists estimated the world's total number of  species as high as 10 million. Then, in 1982, after an  intensive sampling of tropical rain forests, others raised the  estimate by threefold.  So how many species live on Earth? The answer is still a  mystery, and it has a direct relationship to our need for  protected wilderness ecosystems.  Because, of even greater concern, is scientific evidence  that we are witnessing the global destruction of world-class  wilderness ecosystems - particularly tropical forests. If  unchecked, that process will culminate in the summary  elimination of millions of species. Norman Myers noted  recently, ""Of all the environmental assaults we are mounting  against the Earth, mass extinction will be the most profound:'3  Isn't it ironic that just when we are learning so much  about the origins of life, we are also allowing so much of  life's biological diversity to disappear? Isn't it tragic that just  when we are learning how to improve the quality of life  through spectacular advances in bio-engineering and  associated technologies, we are also allowing entire stocks of  genetic materials to be eliminated?  Those are elements of the global picture. But how do they  relate to the protection of wilderness areas in Idaho or even in  North America? To some, it may seem a tenuous connection. To  others, it may appear irrelevant. It may seem like just another aca-  6  ~·  1  demic question. I hope to convince the skeptics otherwise. Be­cause  our need for wilderness is more than just aesthetic, more  than just spiritual, and more than just poetic. Our need for wilder­ness,  perhaps most of all, is scientific and economic.  Let us first examine the scientific values. As the basic unit of  evolutionary biology, the species is also the basic unit of ecology.  An ecosystem, comprised of species in association with their en­vironments,  is best understood when we can divide it into its com­ponent  parts.  Then we can understand the relationships within and between  species and their habitats. If we do not have intact natural  ecosystems- such as those found in large, undisturbed wilder­ness  areas- then we severely limit our global - and our local  -opportunities for studying the determinants of species diversi­ty,  population regulation, energy cycles, nutrient flows, social sys­tems  and community structure.  All are critical to understanding how natural ecosystems func­tion-  whether it is the relationship of elk to their habitat in Ida­ho  or the relationship of humankind to the biosphere.  7  Dr. Maurice Hornocker, associated with this university and  the National Wildlife Federation, showed us that in seminal  research which he and his colleagues conducted on mountain lions  in central Idaho. His long-term research project demonstrated the  relationships between mountain lions' intrinsic behavior and the  wilderness areas they inhabit. Most important, his research high­lighted  the fact that knowledge about the effects of species on  their habitat is essential if we are to make sound management de­cisions  for the future of any ecosystem. Too little research of this  type is being conducted today, and we need to understand why.  After all, most in society agree that scientific inquiry is essen­tial  if we are to understand the world around us. And most in  society agree that such knowledge is highly valuable in  formulating solutions to resource management problems.  Therefore, why has so I ittle long-term research about  appropriate wilderness-related topics been undertaken?  Partially because many in our society can't see the importance  of wilderness ecosystems until they are shown their economic  values.  So let me do just that-first on a global scale and then  with an example from Idaho.  Worldwide, every time a prescription drug is bought,  there is a 50-percent chance that the purchase owes its origin  to materials from wild organisms. In the United States, the  annual commercial value of these medicines is approximately  14 billion dollars. Around the world, the commercial value  tops 40 bi II ion dollars a year.  In other words, the pharmaceutical industry has an  enormous stake in the health of worldwide wilderness  ecosystems. If the current rate of global habitat destruction  and species loss continues, the pharmaceutical industry -  and humankind -will be denied opportunities to discover  new drugs to end the suffering and death of millions.  A recent Congressional advisory group found that species  are disappearing at a rate perhaps not seen since the loss of  the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. At this rate, an average of  100 species may become extinct each day by the turn of the  century. Most extinctions will take place in tropical  wilderness areas- like those in Madagascar.  8  : ~  The Madagascar forests, for instance, are the native habi­tat  of the rosy periwinkle. That species contains alkaloids that  have yielded two potent medicines against a variety of blood­related  cancers. To date, more than 93 percent of  Madagascar's forests - including habitat for rosy periwinkles  - have been destroyed. More than half the native plant and  animal species are presumed lost.  The National Cancer Institute has reported that in the  Amazon Basin alone there are undoubtedly several other  species of plants that could yield ""superstar"" drugs against  cancer. But we may never even know their names because,  sadly, as the world loses wild things and wild places, we also  lose the myriad benefits they have held secret from  humankind.  Now, let's turn homeward, to Idaho. People come to  Idaho for a lot of good reasons. For the breath-taking scenery,  the forests, the sparkling trout streams and the wild,  untouched lands. They come to Idaho for what those of you  who are residents already know. They come for Idaho's  spectacular outdoors-they come for the wilderness.  The National Wildlife Federation and our affiliate, the  Idaho Wildlife Federation, recently asked 11 thousand  nonresident hunters about Idaho's public lands. An  overwhelming 87 percent supported the designation of more  wilderness in the state. Less than five percent of the  respondents opposed more wilderness designation. At the  same time, more than 68 percent of the hunters said they  were satisfied with their hunting experience last year.  What does the survey really illustrate? That Idaho's natural  amenities, while important for their aesthetic values, are also  important for their tourist and economic potential. The  hunters we surveyed will be back next year- and the year  after- to pursue recreation in Idaho. So will thousands of  others. And they will all bring their checkbooks.  The tourism industry in Idaho has become the state's  leading employer, and now rivals traditional industries such as  agriculture and mining in overall economic impact. For  example, during the 1984-85 outfitting season, nearly 70  9  thousand people hunted, fished, skied, mountaineered and  otherwise took advantage of Idaho's outdoor resources.  They spent more than 19 million dollars in outfitting and  guide activities. Of that amount, nearly 15.5 million dollars  stayed in the state. Additionally, the outfitting and guide  activities stimulated 24 million dollars in adjunct services for  a grand total of more than 38 million dollars poured into the  state's economy. The activities created more than 700 full-time  jobs.  The 1984-85 season was a record-breaker for the  recreation industry in Idaho. And the trend should continue,  in Idaho and elsewhere. In the Pacific Northwest, it is  estimated that even if all recommended wilderness areas were  designated as such, demand for recreation by the year 2030  would still exceed the region's capacity by 50 percent. The  economic potential in wilderness is enormous.  The pragmatic- or economic- value of wilderness has  not settled the debate about wilderness. The search for a  balancing of priorities continues. It is little wonder, because  the questions surrounding wilderness are thorny.  In our multiple-options society, how do we provide  enough timber to meet our nation's needs while increasing  the size of our wilderness system? How do we decide  between resources needed for ""national security"" - resources  like minerals, oil and gas- and the resource of land; which  warrants protection for its wilderness values?  How do we meet the ever increasing demand for  dispersed wilderness recreation - for hunting, fishing,  backpacking, rafting- and still maintain the solitude that is  central to the ""wilderness experience""?  Developing Responsible Options  Do I know the answers? No. I'm not even sure I know all  of the questions. However, let me offer some thoughts about  how to develop responsible options.  First, we need long-term and properly funded research to  provide the kinds of information required to understand  10  r .  complex ecosystems and to resolve complicated public policy  and resource management issues.  Let me give you a ""rea I-I ife"" example of how the lack of  such long-term research has produced a massive, national  environmental conflict. In 1980, when the Alaska National  Interest Lands Conservation Act became law, its Section 1002  set aside 1.5 million acres of the Coastal Plain of the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge for further study of its natural  resources and potential for oil and gas development.  Although the Coastal Plain - or the 1002 area, as it is  commonly called - is a relatively small part of this  19-million acre wildlife refuge, it is considered the most  biologically productive area. It includes the primary calving  ground for the internationally invaluable Porcupine caribou  herd. This area, as part of an undisturbed arctic ecosystem, is  of world-class stature. In fact, the land adjacent to it to the  east and south has already been designated as ""wilderness:'  ,,  11  1 ' ' ("" -  /;  !/ ! /-  ;/ 'Jo!it ~  ~~~-  Now, seven years later and with virtually no  comprehensive research data in hand, the U.S. Department of  the Interior is proposing that the entire area be made  available for leasing and full oil field development. Congress  faces two diametrically opposed pieces of legislation: One for  total wilderness designation and the other for total  development.  Once again, we are poised for a bitter battle where  emotions are high, facts are few, and a number of important  national issues are at stake.  What happened? Why do we find ourselves at the edge  of a ""black hole"" of public policy, asked to take a leap of  faith into the unknown? Sadly, the answer is simple: In the  ""what you don't know won't hurt you"" theory of government  that has dominated Washington, D.C., in recent years, political  ideology prevails over knowledge.  Some people - including those in the Reagan  Administration - have clad the need for oil and gas  development in the patriotic cloak of ""national security:' The  administration would rush the nation into a decision about oil  field development, in spite of knowing very little about the  possible impacts on one of the world's most sensitive  ecosystems.  Questions That Must be Answered  We have not answered questions that must be answered  before a Congressional decision can be made about opening  the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil  development or maintaining its current protected status. For  example, do we really know enough about the potential oi I  reserves of the 1002 area? No. And I believe we must know  what exists there even if we decide that the nation's best stra­tegic  course requires deferral of extraction for another 50  years.  Other questions linger. For example, do we really  understand the probable impacts of development on the  internationally invaluable Porcupine caribou herd or on the  area's musk oxen population or other fish and wildlife  12  , I  resources? No. Do we know the environmental impacts of full  oil field development on the area's air and water quality or  the effects of toxic substance bioaccumulation? No. Has  anyone evaluated the cumulative impacts of circumpolar  development on the arctic environment and its wild living  resources? No.  I could go on, but I think I've made my point. A  coordinated, long-term research program was not undertaken  before the critical question of oil and gas development in this  arctic ecosystem was presented.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not the only such  instance. We continue to make the same kinds of mistakes on  a wide range of important public policy issues. Our society  must learn that in order to make responsible decisions among  competing and complex choices, all interests will be best  served if better science and enhanced information transfer  become more integral elements of the public decision-making  process.  Surely, if we can commit billions of research dollars to  the development of a dubious space-based defense program,  then we should commit millions of dollars to environmental  research designed to understand the life-support systems of  this planet of which we are but one part.  No Better Gift  In the very early 1960s, President John Kennedy pledged  to put a man on the moon. In 1969, we accomplished that  feat. Wouldn't it be just as worthy of a President today to  commit our nation to a comprehensive inventory of the  world's wild living resources by the year 2000? Aside from a  world at peace with itself, I know of no better gift we could  leave to the children of the 21st century.  Let me make a couple of final points about the process of  scientific research.  One of the most important lessons I learned about  scientific research came during my graduate school days at  the University of Alberta in Canada. I had just presented to  13  my major professor the data from my doctoral dissertation on  the quantification of the structures and function of a complex  biological community.  Without a word, he looked carefully through my reams of  computer printouts and graphs. After an hour or more, he  looked up and said, ""these are the most incredible answers I  have ever seen . . . . Do you have any idea what the  questions are?""  Whether by design or chance, his response sent a tidal  wave of fear through me. Fortunately, after I regained my  composure, I convinced him that I did, indeed, have some  idea of what the questions were.  The point he made so succinctly has remained with me:  Scientific research is conducted within a framework of  developing and testing hypotheses. That lesson must apply as  we try to answer scientific questions relating to wilderness  ecosystems.  Frankly, we need to generate and test more rigorous hy­potheses  at every stage of the research process. Likewise, we  need to reallocate our research priorities and our research  dollars. Haven't we ""counted"" enough elk feces? Do we really  need the 10 thousand and first research project on the white­tailed  deer when the species is flourishing, and at least 10  million dollars have been spent on research since 1950?  Wouldn't it be more valuable to fund long-term research  programs into such questions as: How do wilderness  ecosystems function? What species are present? What is their  relative stability over time? What variables are most critical?  What happens when they are perturbated by natural causes?  By human activities? What resource management knowledge  can we apply to nonwi lderness areas?  And wouldn't it be more valuable to quantify the demand  curves for wilderness recreation or its contribution to our  Gross National Product? Wouldn't it be more valuable to  assess our land management policies regarding a// public  lands in order to determine how much acreage should be  designated as ""wilderness""? Wouldn't it be more valuable to  14  ·'  ""-  evaluate how many miles of roads we can build in our  national forests before we end up with a highway system  separated by strings of trees and silted streams instead of an  integrated forest ecosystem capable of sustaining a broad array  of renewable natural resources?  And, finally, given the scale of the worldwide destruction  of wilderness ecosystems and the limited financial resources  at our disposal, wouldn't it be prudent to systematically  identify those areas of greatest importance and aggressively  proceed to protect them? This priority ranking approach,  sometimes known in medical circles as a ""triage strategy;'  would not be without controversy. Who decides, for example,  what areas are most important?  However, as Norman Myers recently noted, far from  seeking to establish quantification of all critical parameters, a  triage approach tries to identify all relevant sets of values in  order to illuminate an unduly confused situation.4 Such an  15  approach would bring a degree of order to the current  haphazard process and allow us to make the best use of  available financial and other resources. By emphasizing the  protection of entire communities of species or entire  ecosystems, we could avoid the moral dilemmas inherent in a  triage approach as it relates to saving individual endangered  species.  In short, we need more emphasis on the importance of  natural resources-related scientific and socioeconomic  research to meet the needs of modern society. And we need  to approach such research more creatively, even if it generates  some controversy.  A New Attitude  In addition to a new research direction, we need a new  attitude. First, it is important to remember that science is only  orderly after the fact. During the research process - and  particularly on the frontiers of research - science can be  chaotic and fiercely controversial. Likewise, we need to be more  cautious in characterizing research as either ""basic"" or  ""applied:' While there may be some truth in the definition  that a ""specialist"" is someone who ""knows more and more  about less and less;' there is another side to that coin. A  tremendous idea in science often appears to have its birth as  a particular answer to a narrow question. Many times, it is  much later that the ramifications of that answer become  apparent. What began as knowledge about very I ittle often  turns out to be wisdom about a great deal.  As Louis Pasteur said, ""There is no such thing as applied  science. There are only applications of science:'  Second, we must bury the adversarial relationships that  have existed too long among various sectors of our society.  Isn't it time that the timber industry and conservation interests  stop drawing battle lines and start charting an effective and  positive strategy for both economic development and  enhancement of the wilderness system? Can't we agree that if  we bring better information and less rhetoric to the decision­making  process, we will produce better public policies?  16  -1  l  f -  l .  Finally, we must do a far better job of moving new  information into the public policy and resource management  arenas. Relevant research must reach the table where  decisions are made.  From the applications of science wi II come  understanding. And from understanding will come new and  creative opportunities for meeting the needs of society. Acting  on those opportunities will present a challenge to all of us. In  order to meet those challenges, we need leaders who can set  aside narrow, provincial thinking and adopt the broader goal  of a nation secure in both its economic vitality and in the  conservation of its natural resources. A nation whose people,  while first and foremost Americans, are also citizens of the  world.  We need leaders who are willing to take risks, but not  with the health of our environment or the natural heritage we  hold in trust for future generations. We need leaders to  educate our society and provide the scientific knowledge for  continued advancement. We need leaders from all walks of  life who have inspired visions of a better tomorrow and a  sense of stewardship for those yet unborn.  Finally, as we face the leadership challenges, we should  take to heart the words of a great conservationist, President  Theodore Roosevelt: ""Far better it is to dare mighty things, to  win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than  to take rank with those who neither enjoy much nor suffer  much because they live in the gray twilight that knows not  victory nor defeat:'  We must resolve not to live in that gray twilight but, rath­er,  to search the vastness of wild places for that which we  have lost- and for that which we have not yet found. We  must ""hear the challenge, learn the lessons, pay the costs:'  For ours among all generations is, literally, being given the  last chance to save the best of that which remains of our  wilderness heritage. We dare not fail our duty.  17  NOTES  1 P.H. Raven. 1986. ""We're Killing Our World:' AAAS Keynote  Address, Chicago.  2 E.O. Wilson. 1985.

Using Wilderness Experiences to Enhance Human Potential and Understanding,Ian Player,"Lecture given by Ian Player DSM. Opening remarks by Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe associate professor at the Univeristy of Idaho, Department of Wildland Recreation Management, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center. Introduction by John C. Hendee, Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences at the University of Idaho. The lecture opens with thanks and greetings, and an anecdote about how  gatherings are best held in the outdoors, which inspire dignity. The lecture is a testimony to Player's own experience with wilderness and how it has impacted his life. The lecture opens with the context of his country, South Africa, which is complicated. It continues with the speaker's perspective of World War II from the front lines in Italy. After the war Player canoed a 110 miles stretch of the African wilderness, his first experience in the wild. The lecture then details Player's experience on the Natal Parks Board and protecting wildlife from poachers. The lecture gives an example of humans being an important predator in the ecosystem. Poetry is touched on as an important tool to communicate the value of conservation. The lecture transitions into the story of Player's involvement in the protection of the endangered White Rhino and antelope. Once again Player speaks of how taking people on treks into the wilderness in small groups changes their perspectives. The lecture details the wisdom of a South African native Magqubu Ntombela who knew much and taught Player a lot about the land and it's wildlife. The story of how those wilderness treks turned into The Wilderness Leadership School, often a spiritual experience for those who participated. The gatherings at the end of these treks then turned into The World Wilderness Congress, where people from many countries gathered to inspire conservation. The lecture concludes with an illustration of hope, and an exhortation to build the future on hope. The lecture concludes with thanks and a benediction.",1988-04-21,,lectures; South African; indigenous people; poetry; wilderness areas; wilderness; international relations; wars; world wars;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl09,application/pdf,text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Krumpe  I n the United States, Idaho is surpassed only by Alaska  and California in the extent of its wilderness. To increase  our knowledge of wilderness, the University of Idaho in 1972  established the Wilderness Research Center.  The center's purpose is to encourage research and  educational programs that lead to a better understanding of the  structure and function of natural ecosystems, of man's relation­ships  to them, and of their perpetual protection as wilderness.  Much wilderness-related research takes place at the center's  Taylor Ranch Field Station in the Frank Church-River of No  Return Wilderness.  In lfJ77, the center inaugurated the Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureship as an annual event. In the years since,  national experts at the forefront of wilderness issues and manage­ment  have shared their reflections and experiences of wilderness.  Beginning in lfJ77, lectures have been delivered by Frank  Church, Roderick Nash, Cecil D. Andrus, Patrick F. Noonan,  Russell E. Dickenson, Michael Frome, Brock Evans, and Jay D.  Hair.  This year, for the first time, our distinguished lecturer brings  a perspective formed outside the United States. Ian Player is one  of South Africa's chief conservationists and founder of the  Wilderness Leadership School and the World Wilderness Con­gresses.  As worldwide concern for nature conservation and  preserve management builds, the Wilderness Research Center is  delighted to welcome an international conservation figure, Dr.  Ian Player.  Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe is an associate professor in the University  of Idaho Department of Wildland Recreation Management and  director of the Wilderness Research Center.  ''I can remember walking over a dune toward the edge of the lake one  morning, and there must have been twenty thousand flamingos, and they  took off just as the sun was catching their wings. ''  ii  Introduction  John C. Hendee  Good evening. Tonight is special because we have a  distinguished author, international conservationist, man  of vision, and man of accomplishment as our distinguished  wilderness resource lecturer. Dr. Ian Player is the brother of  Gary Player, the golfer, although among conservationists Gary is  known as Ian's brother.  Ian Player developed his interest in conservation and  wilderness while initiating wild river canoeing in South Africa  and launching the Duzi River canoe race from Pietennaritzburg  to Durban. He was the first person to ever make that run.  Developing the race into an annual event, he won its first three  runs. Wild river canoeing-a sport launched by his vision-is  now almost a national sport in South Africa.  Another Ian Player vision, developed while he was a game  ranger for the Natal Parks Board, was that the nearly extinct  white rhino could be saved through capture and translocation to  zoos around the world for breeding and reintroduction in  southern Africa. It was an enormous vision and one that must  have provoked laughter from his colleagues who imagined  themselves darting the 4,000-pound rhinos with tranquilizers and  capturing them to ship to zoos. But they did it, and the white  rhino has now been restored to hunting status in South Africa.  iii  Ian Player wrote of saving the white rhino in his book The White  Rhino Saga and of his canoeing adventures in Men, Rivers and  Canoes.  He had yet another vision while chief ranger on the  Umfolozi Game Reserye: that if people were going to appreciate  wild areas, they needed to experience them. So he established a  program, now a South African tradition, in which conservation  officers, as part of their regular duties, take members of the  public on four-day treks into wild areas of game reserves. While  visiting South Africa, I was impressed to find that this is a most  sought-after duty-taking public groups on trail to teach them  about nature.  After seeing the success of wilderness trails sponsored by  the Natal Parks Board, Ian reasoned that if leaders were taken  out to experience wild country, they would develop an en­vironmental  conscience and be personally inspired to greater  achievement. So he established the Wilderness Leadership  School, and over the years he has taken more than 8,000 people,  no more than six at a time, on four- to six-day treks into the  wilderness. Many world leaders in government and private in­dustry,  and young people who have or will become leaders, have  joined him on these wilderness trails. Their insights are recorded  in his most recent book, South African Passage: The Diary of  the South African Wilderness Leadership School.  With his friend, the famous Zulu chief and game ranger  Magqubu Ntombela, who helped him establish the Wilderness  Leadership School, Ian conceived of the World Wilderness Con­gresses:  great indabas (a Zulu word for gathering) where people  of the world would come together and share their ideas for sav­ing  the planet. He established the First World Wilderness Con­gress  in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1fJ77, a second in  Australia in 1980, a third in Scotland in 1983, and the Fourth  World Wilderness Congress in Colorado in September 1987,  attended by 1,700 delegates from 65 countries.  As one might expect, a man with such radical ideas was  often restrained in his position as a government official-the  chief conservator for fish, game, and parks in the province of  Natal. He left government service from that position, the ranking  conservation officer in his province, to develop the Wilderness  Leadership School and the World Wilderness Congresses.  iv  In the past few years, his country has begun to officially  recognize his many contributions. He has been awarded the  Knight in the Order of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernard; the  Distinguished Meritorious Service Medal (DSM), his country's  highest civilian recognition; an honorary doctor of philosophy  degree; and has been named a member of the statutory advisory  body, the Natal Parks Board, which is the largest and most  prestigious conservation agency in his country.  Dr. Ian Player is now retiring as vice chairman of the  Wilderness Leadership School. I hope that his next career will  see him associated with students, faculty, conservation col­leagues,  and citizens all over the world so that he can bring  them his message of hope and inspiration for the conservation of  the planet.  I know Dr. Player's distinguished lecture will be a wonderful  experience for us. Ian, we are honored by your participation in  our lecture series.  My friend, Dr. Ian Player.  John C Hendee is dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and  Range Sciences at the University of Idaho.  v  vi  USING WILDERNESS  EXPERIENCES 1D  ENHANCE HUMAN  POTENTIAL AND  UNDERSTANDING  Ian Player  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very  much Dr. Hendee for your introduction. Being the  brother of Gary Player isn't very easy. I always tell people, ""If  you want to be rich become a golfer; if you want to be poor  become a conservationist.""  I feel very humbled in talking to you this evening. It is a  great honor for me to be here, and I am very grateful indeed to  you people for coming out this evening in bad weather, although  at home, of course, this rain would be considered very good  weather. I must also compliment you on your city, which is very  clean, and I would like to say too how impressed I've been with  your university. I don't visit universities often, but the students  and staff have impressed me with their openness, and it has been  a great delight to talk with them.  I always like to experience the atmosphere of a place when I  arrive, so I took the opportunity to go with Dr. Hendee to the  white pine forest, and we stood for a little while after walking a  short distance up the trail and just listened to that wonderful  1  silence. I was reminded that when the United Nations first met,  one of their very first meetings was in the Muir Woods, just out­side  San Francisco. You might be interested to know too that it  was General J.C. Smuts, one of South Africa's first prime  ministers, who drafted the charter for the League of Nations and  who played a prominent part in the early deliberations of the  United Nations. He was an outstanding naturalist, an expert on  grasses, and a man who thoroughly understood the concept of  wilderness. I am sure that he encouraged everyone to hold the  inaugural meeting of the United Nations at Muir Woods.  I thought to myself while we were standing in the silence of  those giant white pines: What a great pity it is that the United  Nations doesn't meet in the sacred groves anymore, because I'm  sure if it did there would be much better understanding among  people. In such a place you can't stand and scream at people.  Before long the silence would make it sound ridiculous. This is  why so-called primitive people could hold gatherings, or indabas,  that had such dignity.  I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank America. The  United States of America has been very kind to my brother. He  has taken a lot of money out of here, and I can assure you that  I've done my very best to bring some of it back. You have a  very great country, with marvelous people.  Recently I traveled in South Africa with Dean Hendee; Joe  Zimmer; my long-time friend and colleague Vance Martin, who  ran the Fourth World Wilderness Congress; and Chief Oren  Lyons of the Onondaga Nation, part of the Iroquois Confederacy.  We went together on trail-a wilderness trek-and all of us were  impressed by how Chief Oren Lyons, a Native American,  brought a new dimension to our group, one similar to that pro­vided  by my old Zulu friend Magqubu Ntombela, now 88 years  old. It was satisfying for me to see the two of them converse,  Chief Oren Lyons who is very articulate in English and Mag­qubu  who speaks only a half dozen words of English, and each  understand exactly what the other was saying.  My Personal Journey  The title of my lecture this evening is ""Using Wilderness  Experiences to Enhance Human Potential and Understanding.""  2  Let me say that I do not like public speaking, and this subject is  not easy. I considered Dr. Hendee's invitation very carefully, and  then I realized I could only speak from one aspect-that was  myself, my own personal experience, how wilderness has  enhanced my life, how in fact it not only saved me, but made  me what I am today. So what I have to say tonight is my  testimony to wilderness, of how its therapeutic, spiritual, scien­tific,  and other values made an impact upon me and how,  because of this, I was able to help many other people.  The Zulus, who make up the biggest tribe in southern  Africa, when they meet you for the first time, they ask the ques­tion,  ""Where do you come from?"" They wish to know of your  father, your grandfather, your clan. They want to know your  whole background. It would be impossible for me to do that this  evening. In fact, when thinking of this ritual, I always remember  a statement of C.G. Jung about a Chinese philosopher. He asked  the philosopher a question, and when the answer was complete,  Jung said, ""I asked the man about a piece of grass and he  brought the whole meadow."" All I bring you this evening is a  piece of grass, but I hope it will represent this vast and complex  topic that would take a much longer time to tell.  A Troubled Land  I want to stress that what I have to say about African  wilderness this evening must be seen against the broad  background of my country. I live in one of the most complicated  countries on our planet. It is a first world and a third world  country with all the difficulties associated with both. It is a  country of many peoples and a plethora of languages: Zulu,  Sotho, Tswana, Venda, Bapedi, Swazi, Shangaan, English,  Afrikaans, Tamil, and many others. The biggest population of In­dians  outside of India lives in South Africa. From a people vir­tually  enslaved by the British in the 19th century, they have  become a most important merchant class. South Africa is a  troubled land, but where is there real peace anywhere in the  world? No country has been more fought over than South  Africa: black against black, white against white, and white  against black. Our country is littered with monuments of war,  and our land has absorbed more than its fair share of blood.  The western world has focused on South Africa with  increasing intensity in recent years. We have to carry the shadow,  3  the dark side of the world. We have become the scapegoat and  the pariah. But the truth is that we should be judged by African  standards and not those of the western world. We are now  Africans irrespective of our color or race. I believe that deep in  their hearts, most people know that if South Africa cannot sort  out its own problems, neither will the world be able to solve its  problems. We are a microcosm of the world, and the giant  among historians, Toynbee, acknowledges this fact.  For my own part, I think that the ecological problems of soil  erosion and overpopulation and the rapidly diminishing wild  lands are far more serious in the long term than the political  situation, although I know the two are linked. I believe that  those who go on the wilderness trails or treks are not only the  ecological vanguard of South Africa, but also the pioneers for a  new constitution. It will be a long time in coming, but the yeast  is stirring. I hear murmurings of it on every trail I take out, and  I see glimpses of it in the reports that come in from young peo­ple,  as you will read in the book recently published by Fulcrum  Press, South African Passage: Diaries of the Wilderness  Leadership School.  Education and »fzr  I went to school for only a short time, just before the  Second World War, then I went off to fight in Italy with the  Sixth South African Armoured Division which was attached to  the American Fifth Army. So my formal education was very  limited. Consequently, I've always honored those who are  educated, because I realize how much I've missed. I hope that  all the students who are here in this wonderful place realize how  fortunate they are, and I am envious of them and the oppor­tunities  they have. I say to them tonight: Grab the opportunities  that your wonderful country and this fine institution give you.  I am a sixth generation South African; my forebears were  English, Dutch, and Scottish. My family fought in the Basuto  War of 1860, the Zulu War of 1879, the Boer War of 1899-1902,  the Great War of 1914-1918, and also in the Second World War, in  which I lost more than · a half dozen relatives. I must say  truthfully that my life has been a struggle-an almost overpower­ing  struggle. But it is the problems and difficulties that one faces  that bring understanding of the true essence of life.  4  As a boy of 12, I had a bad accident and damaged my right  leg. At the time I was very bitter because I loved sport. I was  considered a very promising cricketer and a promising soccer  and rugby player. I knew I would never be able to play any  games. It was a wound that I carried for a very long time. When  I tried to join the army in 1944, I had difficulty convincing the  doctors, but the war had advanced to such a state and South  African casualties were so heavy that I was accepted despite my  bad knee.  The war was very important to me because I learned about  human suffering. Italy, in 1944-45, was a devastated country. I  saw women and children searching garbage bins where soldiers  had thrown away food. I saw death; in fact it was a constant  companion-men or boys I was with were killed. And that leaves  its mark.  Harold Macmillan, a British prime minister, toward the end  of his life said, ""There are only two forces in the world of man.  One is the great spiritual force of religion, and the other is what  I call the force of common sense."" In my life I have found that  we are given both, but in our inflation, or what the Greeks call­ed  hubris, and in a technological society, we have to constantly  rediscover these truths. We have in many ways become an  Icarian society. We live in an Icarian age. We have to remember  that like Icarus, who flew too close to the sun, and his wings  melted, and he came crashing down to a new reality, we too  have to relearn our dependence upon the earth and the need to  fmd ways to live in harmony with our environment.  My First Taste of Wilderness  Again in the war, in 1944, I was in the Appennines, bitterly  cold, extremely hungry, waiting to launch the final attack on the  Germans in the Po Valley. A group of us were sitting around a  fire; we didn't know if we would get home; and we were all  talking about what we would do if we did get home, or what we  would like to do. One thing I said was that if I made it home, I  would like to canoe from Pietermaritzburg to Durban, a distance  of 110 miles. ·  In 1950 I made that journey, and it was there that I  experienced my first taste of wilderness. I can remember being  5  caught in the middle of one of those great African storms, with  terrific lightning and thunder coming from all directions. I was  in a canyon, and the lightning was bouncing off the walls all  around me. For the first time in my life, I really felt a part of  the elements. It was my first wilderness experience.  The Beginning of a Yearning  In 1952, I joined the Natal Parks Board, the equivalent of  one of your state fish and game departments, as a game ranger. I  can clearly ·remember that all I had with me were two plates,  two knives, two forks, two cups, and three books: T. E.  Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom, which is one of the great  pieces of wilderness writing, although Lawrence never would  have acknowledged it or understood it; a book of Shakespeare;  and the Bible. Those books sustained me for a long time. One  thing I got out of the Bible was in Proverbs: ""It is without vi­sion  that people perish."" It was something that burned itself into  my mind. You will understand when I say it that I was disturb­ed.  I was so very young; I had been in the war, and I had an in­adequate  education. So I was part of the lost generation-! never  did really experience youth-and I was thrust into the isolated  world of a game ranger in a very wild country.  One of the first places where I was stationed was a little  game reserve of only 30,000 acres, right up on the Mozambique  border, called Ndumo, which is a Zulu word meaning to thunder.  I was sent there to fence it, to make roads, train game scouts,  and to put an end to poaching-that was rough-and also to do  bird and game studies. It was a wonderful place; two great rivers  meet there, and my canoeing came in very handy. I often canoed  on those rivers and all the small lakes that came about when the  rivers flooded. The place was full of hippo and crocodiles. It  was often exciting being inside a kayak or canoe and in the  middle of a hippo herd.  On one occasion I was paddling down the Pongola River and  a hippo overturned the canoe in an area known for its abundance  of crocodiles. I was in a terrible panic, but remembered to dive  down deep and swim underwater to the other bank in the belief  that crocodiles do not attack one underwater, an erroneous belief  as it later turned out. But it was the beginning of my yearning to  understand the habits and rhythms of that wild place, the habits  6  of the animals and the birds. I was reading technical literature  from all over the world, and I made it my business to know the  scientific names of the birds, the trees, the animals, and the in­sects.  I considered myself quite proficient and could talk with  authority.  The Quiet Magic  But all the time I knew I was missing something, and I  could never understand what is was until one day I received a  book by Laurens van der Post called Venture to the Interior. I  remember sitting in the small, pre-fabricated bungalow and  beginning to read this book in the late evening, just as the hippo  began coming out of the rivers and the lakes to graze. I never  put that book down until I heard the fish eagles calling in the  morning, an incredible sound, and became aware that without  my realizing it, the whole night had passed as I read that book.  That book was about the soul of Africa, and it gave me a whole  new perception. The ancient Romans said, ""Ex Africa semper  alquid novi"": Out of Africa always something new. It was so for  me.  The time at Ndumo among its wild sycamore fig forests, its  dark rivers and lakes with hippo, crocodile, and flocks of  pelican, flamingo, and clouds of whistling duck had made a deep  and profound impact upon me and began the healing process and  the recognition of spiritual values. The wilderness atmosphere  had begun to work its quiet magic.  The Anti-Poaching Patrols  From Ndumo I was sent to Mkuze Game Reserve and spent  the next five months doing nothing but anti-poaching patrols,  which were very unpleasant. I was shot at by people who would  have no hesitation in killing a game ranger interfering with their  poaching activities. It was not easy working among communities  violently opposed to any kind of conservation: cattlemen, tribal  people, gangs that would come in and wipe out a herd of im­pala,  load them into trucks, and drive off. There was absolutely  no sympathy for our conservation cause among the locals. Even  the police and the magistrates were against us. But it was a  lesson, and one that I learned well. You can't simply take  7  everybody else's attitude for granted. You can't think that they  too know what is right just because you are a conservationist.  I was then stationed on the coast that leads to the  Mozambique border. And we went on long patrols along this  very remote coastline, one of the most beautiful in the world, a  place where Portuguese survivors from shipwrecks in the 16th  and 17th centuries walked, and they called it ""The Sands of  Gold."" It was there that I came in contact with the sea turtles,  the leatherbacks and the loggerheads. It was part of my job to  protect them, and today the Natal Parks Board turtle protection is  considered one of the most successful programs of its type in the  world.  There is a rhythm to these great beasts coming out of the  sea, in the month of October, the loggerhead and leatherback  turtles. I recall being absorbed watching the female turtles crawl­ing  out of the sea and up onto the sand terraces to lay their eggs.  Here was a natural rhythm, one that had been so for thousands  of years. A few months later the young turtles hatch and make  their way down over the sand to the sea, attacked by dogs and by  the ghost crab, back to the depths of the sea to eventually return  as adults to lay their eggs.  A ~ry Important Predator  I was stationed at the mouth of St. Lucia Lake, which is one  of the greatest estuaries in Africa, if not the world. It is 45  miles long and a combination of fresh and saltwater, full of hip­po,  crocodiles, birds, and both sea fish and freshwater fish. At  that time the Tonga people lived on land between the lake and  the sea, and I can remember seeing sights that will probably  never be seen again. I saw tribal people hiding in trees beside  hippo paths where the animals would emerge at night to graze  on the grasslands. The people would drop onto the young hippo  and kill them with axes and knives.  The tribal people were moved from the periphery of the lake  when our Forestry Department wanted to plant exotic species of  trees such as pine and eucalyptus. From then on the hippo  population exploded. It was a lesson to know that humans were a  very, very important predator in that wild piece of country, and  had always been so.  8  Of Poetry  I can remember walking over a dune toward the edge of the  lake one morning, and there must have been twenty thousand  flamingos, and they took off just as the sun was catching their  wings. It reminded me of Longfellow's poem ""The Slave's  Dream"":  Before him, like a blood-red flag,  The bright flamingoes flew;  From morn till night he followed their flight,  O'er plains where the tamarind grew,  Till he saw the roofs of Caffre huts,  And the ocean rose to view.  At night he heard the lion roar,  And the hyena scream,  And the river-horse, as he crushed the reeds  Beside some hidden stream;  Seeing those flamingo flying and hearing lion roar and hyena  scream gave me an understanding of the need for the inclusion of  poetry in our conservation world. We sometimes get too bound  up in technology or statistics, and we need poetry to bring us  back to the level of appreciation of the natural world we protect.  All scientists should never forget the value of poetry and what it  can do to make fellow human beings appreciate other values in  our struggle for conservation understanding.  Imagine translating those beautiful, evocative verses of  Longfellow into scientific language, thus: ""Phoenicopterus ruber  or Phoenicopterus minor in flight, followed by the call of Felis  leo, the scream of Crocuta crocuta, while Hippopotamus am­phibius  crushed Phragmites mauritanus and Homo sapiens in  extremis was having an REM sleep."" A slight difference?  One of your great wilderness writers, Sigurd Olson, wrote,  ""Nature is always in a state of equilibrium and only when we  manipulate it for our own purposes do we contribute toward im­balance.""  This is certainly true, and particularly true of Lake St.  Lucia, a once primordial region, later surrounded by sugar cane  farms, the establishment of which necessitated the cutting out of  9  the papyrus reed beds that helped to filter and trap the silt. An·  imbalance was created, and in a short 40 years a unique lake  system was jeopardized. Then, with the planting of exotic pine  plantations, the reed bed and the sponges began drying up, and  sport fishermen now catch very little. It is only recently that we  are beginning to understand what we have done to this place.  The White Rhino  In 1958 I returned to the U mfolozi Game Reserve, where I  had already spent a short time in 1952-53 and 1955. I was  reunited with a man who has played a very important part in my  life, Magqubu Ntombela, now 88 years of age, strong as a lion,  can't read or write, and yet is the wisest man I have ever known.  It is with him that I went on long anti-poaching patrols. If he  taught me one thing it was the value of being an example. He  never ever corrected me; he just behaved correctly. We faced  some very disturbing and distressing times in 1958. Human  populations were exploding all over South Africa, and large  numbers of people were coming and squatting on the edge of the  Umfolozi Game Reserve.  Poaching was totally out of control; there was very little law  and order, and within the park there was a population of about  500 white rhino. It would have taken one diseased beast, a cow  or an ox with anthrax, to get in among them and that would  have been the end of one of the most endangered species on our  planet. This led us toward our capture and translocation efforts  to protect the white rhino, a long and involved story full of  politics and full of practical difficulties to get the right drug, to  get the right dart gun, to get the people with enough courage to  go after the rhino, to commit ourselves to knowing the rhino in­timately,  to experience death with a rhino which had been given  too much drug.  The first drug we used was a deadly muscle relaxant,  gallamine triethiodide or Flaxedil. Once the rhino was darted we  had to be in close contact with it until it dropped, then we had  to inject the antidote, Prostigmin, in a vein in the ear within  minutes. You can imagine the difficulties of trying to do this  with a wild rhino, its head moving all over the place, and having  to avoid those horns which could easily disembowel a man.  10  The second drug was morphine, and a gram and more was  required along with a tranquilizer. The dose was so large we had  to use a 20 cc dart, and you can appreciate that it was impossi­ble  to sterilize the dart needle, so as it went into the rhino it car­ried  with it all the surrounding bacilli, causing the wound to go  septic very quickly. We agonized with those animals with wounds  so bad that we could stick our arms in and come out covered  with pus, and then see them get pneumonia and die. I wondered  sometimes if it would not be better to cease the operation. That  is when people like Magqubu Ntombela and Nick Steele were so  important because they said, ""You have begun the job, you must  finish it."" Which we did.  We went on from there to reestablish the rhino everywhere  in its former habitat throughout southern Africa-in the Kruger  National Park where it had been wiped out in 1897, in Zim­babwe,  in Mozambique, where none have survived-the recent  civil war has seen to that. But they are entrenched in places like  Botswana and in zoological gardens throughout the world. Over  11  3,000 have now been captured and translocated. The white rhino  have even been put back on the hunting list and hunters from all  over the world pay astronomical sums to shoot one. We have run  out of wild land for more white rhino, so it is natural that they  should now be culled. We are very proud of this extraordinary  success story in wildlife conservation. A rare wild animal was  brought from the verge of extinction to be put back on the  hunting list in 77 years.  Following that was the capture and translocation of antelope.  I remember very clearly trying to shoot impala with a dart-a  very slow and totally inefficient method of capture. A man nam­ed  Jan Oelofse then developed a new technique of driving the  herds into entrapments of plastic sheeting. Where in the past we  were able to capture 100 antelope in a year, we could now catch  6,000 in three months. Once caught they were sent to restock  other areas in South Africa. That technique has never been fully  appreciated, but it is a technique that can save wildlife on the  continent of Africa because it is a management tool of enormous  importance. There is resistance to this technique being used  elsewhere in Africa because the idea originated in South  Africa-an example of political philosophies being carried to the  most idiotic extremes.  The Wilderness Trails  While all this was going on, a great political struggle for the  land was taking place-the land adjoining the reserve and the  reserve itself. Cattle farmers wanted the land; black tribal people  wanted the land; and we were sandwiched in the middle. That is  what led to the establishment of Natal Parks Board trails,  because I knew by then that if it was possible to give people the  same sort of experience that I had, of walking the wild country  and being out there with the Zulu, then it would be possible to  do something to save the place. And that is what we did.  We took young people, businessmen, and politicians out for  three days at a time, sat around the fire at night, and talked in  ways that are not possible in circles of so-called civilized com­munities.  Lots of lessons were learned there, not only for those  12  on their first trek, but also for those of us who worked in the  game reserves.  Magqubu Ntombela  The values of tribal people in our culture and in our  technological society have been overlooked, yet they have an  enormous contribution to make. They speak a different language  from ourselves, probably an intuitive language if we need to  describe it. Magqubu is always an example of that. Wherever he  went he would be intuitively in tune with his environment. He  was infallible in his judgment. The only time I ever made  mistakes was when I ignored what he had to say. He can't read  or write, but his knowledge of the land is unsurpassed. He can  pick up a feather and tell you a whole story.  Once he picked up the small hoof of a bushbuck on the edge  of a river, and he told me a great story of how a lion had come  and chased the bushbuck, pounced upon it, killed it, and eaten  part of it, and then he showed me where the crocodiles had  come up to finish it. He has a way of reading what is beyond us  and a way of listening too. We are so busy talking, we have  forgotten how to listen.  I remember being with a group of people on a trail.  Magqubu led us down along the Black Umfolozi River, and it  was just beginning to get dark when we saw a pride of lions  across the river. Magqubu said to me, ""We must be quiet  tonight; the lions are going to kill."" And as it got dark, I heard  a bushbuck coming up the river barking (it is one of the barking  antelope), and the next moment I heard it run into the river, the  growling of the lion, and the thud, and finally the last gasp. We  could see nothing at all, but Magqubu was able to describe ex­actly  what was happening in the pitch darkness. We sat there un­til  I heard a pebble drop, and he said, ""Those are the young  cubs coming down."" Sure enough, we heard the mother growl  and go back through the water and bring the cubs one by one to  feed. Then shortly after that there was another sound, and he  said, ""Those are the crocodiles."" I said, ""How can you possibly  know?"" He said, ""If you will listen, you can hear."" He describ­ed  the croc skimming along with its head above the water and  13  brought to my attention the sound of the water splashing upon its  throat. It was coming to feed on the remains of the bushbuck.  The Wilderness Leadership School  These organized treks or trails have led to the establishment  of trails in the Kruger National Park and in other areas in South  Africa. And they led me to start the Wilderness Leadership  School, the first nongovernmental organization of its kind. To  keep the Wilderness Leadership School going became the  greatest struggle of my life. I left the Natal Parks Board in 1974,  after 22 years service, and gave the Wilderness Leadership  School my full-time attention. I again learned lessons, even at  the age of 47. Working for the Natal Parks I took the salary for  granted. The accountant knocks on your door each month to give  you your check. When you are running a private organization  and have to find money yourself, the situation is quite different,  and it was a lesson in my life.  It has, however, been enormously rewarding, because out of  the Wilderness Leadership School came the International  Wilderness Leadership Foundation and the World Wilderness  Congresses and friendships with people from almost every conti­nent.  I was given the opportunity of taking multi-racial groups­whose  members were hostile toward one another-and watching  the wilderness calm them down until they began to see each  other as individuals and not just as people from different races  or cultures.  As part of the experience of the wilderness trek -and we  never have more than seven people at a time-we take turns in  keeping watch at night. Often I would lie near the fire and study  the person on watch without him or her being aware of my  scrutiny. There would be lions or hyenas or elephants calling in  the night, and the magic of Africa would weave its spell. The  people on watch were told that they were there to protect their  companions, because if a lion or a rhino stumbled into camp,  people could be injured. For some participants it was the first  time they had ever been alone, and I remember two young boys  from Los Angeles who had never seen the stars before. To them  the blazing constellations of the southern hemisphere were an  awesome experience, leaving them tearful when they later tried  to describe the heavens full of stars.  14  A Spiritual Experience  One of the interesting lessons that has come out of the trails  of the Wilderness Leadership School is the written experiences  of many of the young people who have participated. You have to  bear in mind that there were a lot of exciting moments on these  trips, canoeing among hippo and crocodile, looking at feeding  lions, and hearing leopard and hyena pass close to the unenclos­ed  and simple camp. But their essays were not about the ex­citements  of the trail; the majority wrote about their time on the  watch. It was in fact a spiritual experience they were having,  similar to the prophets of old who went into the desert or the  mountains to have the time alone to meditate. T.E. Lawrence  puts it best in his book, Seven Pillars of Wisdom. He writes:  15  This creed of the desert seemed inexpressible in words, and  indeed in thought. It was easily felt as an influence, and  those who went into the desert long enough to forget its  open spaces and its emptiness were inevitably thrust upon  God as the only refuge and rhythm of being . . . . This  faith of the desert was impossible in the towns. It was at  once too strange, too simple, too impalpable for export and  common use. The idea, the ground-belief of all Semitic  creeds was waiting there, but it had to be diluted to be  made comprehensible to us. The scream of a bat was too  shrill for many ears: the desert spirit escaped through our  coarser texture. The prophets returned from the desert with  their glimpse of God, and through their stained medium (as  through a dark glass) showed something of the majesty and  brilliance whose full vision would blind, deafen, silence us,  serve us as it had served the Beduin, setting him uncouth,  a man apart.  The World Wilderness Congresses  At the end of every trek, we have an indaba, a Zulu word  for a gathering. The participants sit in a circle, and each person  has the opportunity of having their say.  In 1975, Magqubu and I were on a trail, and at the end of  the five days, when we sat in the circle and had the indaba,  Magqubu said, ""It is time now for a big indaba, a great gather­ing  of all those who have been on the trail."" Magqubu's state­ment  made me think, and I began working on a plan that led to  the First World Wilderness Congress in Johannesburg, South  Africa, in 1977. It took place at a time of political turmoil  following the riots in Soweto in 1976, but the World Wilderness  Congress was an outstanding success in both local and interna­tional  terms. For the first time in the history of South African  nature conservation, there were black tribal game scouts and a  Bushman sharing the congress platform with senior cabinet  ministers, writers, artists, scientists, international bankers, and  leaders in commerce and industry. Many international conserva­tionists  risked the ire of their respective governments and in  some cases their own organizations so that they could show their  solidarity with what we were doing for conservation in South  Africa. We were the guardians of national parks, game reserves,  16  and endangered species that in the end belong to or are the  responsibility of all mankind.  From Johannesburg the World Wilderness Congress went to  Cairns on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. The third one was  held at Inverness and Findhorn in the north of Scotland. The  Fourth World Wilderness Congress was in Denver and Estes Park  in Colorado. I know many of you were there, and I believe it  was the most successful Congress we have had. Some 65 nations  participated, and it was a mini United Nations gathering without  the rancor.  At all the congresses there was a representation of  indigenous peoples, and I believe that their contribution made an  important impact. The indigenous people symbolize the rejected  part of ourselves; they are filled with much ancient wisdom that  in many ways holds the key to the future of all societies. Many  of the guides in the Wilderness Leadership School are tribal  people and in using them on equal terms, in fact on terms  sometimes unequal for us, we have made a contribution to the  building of something new, not only in South Africa, but in the  world.  A Single Green Leaf  The symbol of the Wilderness Leadership School is the leaf  of the Erythrina caffra or coral tree as it is called in America.  The three-pointed leaf represents the philosophy of the  Wilderness Leadership School: Man to God, Man to Man, and  Man to Earth. The leaf was chosen 25 years ago by Magqubu  Ntombela who said when he handed it to me, ""Thatha lokho­take  this leaf. It is the tree of the settlements of people as well  as of the wilderness."" I knew the tree well. In summer the leaves  are green; in winter the leaves drop and blood red flowers take  their place. It symbolizes the growth that man must undergo in  order to become whole.  The idea of using a leaf as a symbol came from my reading  of Grey Owl, an Englishman who became an Ojibway Indian in  Ontario, Canada. Toward the end of his life Grey Owl said,  ""You are tired with years of civilization; I come and offer you­what?  A single green leaf."" In 1987 we brought the leaf back to  North America as a symbol of the Fourth World Wilderness  17  Congress. A statuette of Grey Owl holding the leaf was made by  Jonathan Bronson, and it was awarded to the leader of the  delegation from the People's Republic of China in recognition of  their conservation work.  One very important aspect of the Wilderness Leadership  School's trails is that the school does not want to pit the par­ticipants  against nature for any reason whatsoever. There are  organizations that do this, and perhaps it is an aid in character  building, but it is not our way. We tried it when the school first  began, but something vital was lost. We hope now to provide not  only a conservation awareness, but a deepening of the spirit too.  Courage and Hope  In the conservation movement, which all of us here this  evening are part of, there is a time when there is a great sense  of helplessness. No matter where one goes in the world we see  these dreadful mistakes that we are trying to right. We see a  terrible ravaging of our world: the pollution of the rivers and  seas, collapse of the catchments, advance of deserts, and now  pollution of outer space. It can be overwhelming for anyone who  is sensitive; it can drive them to a point of despair and madness  in wondering if we will ever get it right. But those of us in the  conservation movement live on and battle for what we know to  be right, and I do not believe that it will be in vain. Today, with  a group of university students, we discussed this theme for a mo­ment,  this overwhelming avalanche of destruction that is facing  all of us, and the inclination to give up against something that is  very hard to fight.  I told them the story of Thermopylae where some 300  Spartans under King Leonidas held the pass for three days  against an overwhelming mass of Persians in 480 B.C. In our  modem computer age, I wonder what the computer would reply,  if given the information, if asked what chance the Spartans had.  I believe the computer would have told them to run, and run like  hell. But they did not, and although they were annihilated, their  courage and endurance has come down through the ages:  ""Stranger bear word to the Spartans that we lie here keeping  their charge."" So let us take courage, and if we face an  overwhelming mass of people intent upon destroying our  18  conservation work, we will sell ourselves at great cost, and  through this inspire those who follow us.  I hope I have conveyed to you my feeling for the essence of  the lecture title, ""Using Wilderness Experiences to Enhance  Human Potential and Understanding."" Everything I have achieved  in my own life, I owe to the wilderness experience. I have seen  countless other lives molded and changed by encounters with  wilderness; in most cases, only a few days in the wilderness  atmosphere has been enough to change a life of despair into one  of hope.  To again quote Sigurd Olson: ""When the history of the 20th  century is written, I believe that the conservation movement will  be regarded as the most important aspect of our century. Perhaps  even the only redeeming feature.""  I thank you for your patience this evening and for the  opportunity of being with you. In conclusion, let me remind you  of the story in Greek mythology of Pandora's Box. You will  remember that when it was opened all the bees representing the  ills of the world flew out. Only one remained, and it was the  bee of hope. So it is always upon hope that we must build our  future. We have to hold onto it, because the very moment we  give up hope, we have lost.  I would again like to thank your college and the university  for inviting me to talk this evening. In your dean, Dr. John  Hendee, you have a man who has in a balanced way served the  cause of conservation for a long time. It has been a privilege to  know and to work with him since the Second World Wilderness  Congress in Scotland in 1983.  I also thank Ed Krumpe for a most instructive journey  yesterday and for his many other kindnesses. Vance Martin, the  president of the International Wilderness Leadership Foundation,  the sponsoring organization of the Fourth World Wilderness Con­gress,  is here this evening. I first met him in 1980 at the Second  World Wilderness Congress in Australia. He has done a wonder­ful  job in putting the Third and the Fourth World Wilderness  Congresses together.  19  Finally, I must thank my colleagues in South Africa with  whom I have worked for 36 years in the cause of conservation  and wilderness. Some-Norman Deane, Ken Rochat, and Owen  Letley-have passed into the next world, but others, such as  Nick Steele, Hugh Dent, Barry Clements, John Tinley, Ken  Tinley, Mediceni Gumede, Bruce Dell, Gqakaza Ntombela, Paul  Dutton, John Clark, Jack Vincent, Drummond Densham, and  Magqubu Ntombela, carry on the struggle.  God, bless Africa,  Guard her children,  Guide her leaders,  And give her peace.  20  , ..

Wilderness in Native American Culture,Chief Oren Lyons,"Lecture given by Chief Oren Lyons, professor at the Department of American Studies and Director of Native American Studies at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Opening words by Dr. James R. Fazio, head of the Department of Wildland Recreation Management and acting Director of the Wilderness Research Center. Introduction by John C. Hendee, dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences at the University of Idaho. The lecture opens with a traditional greeting. Chief Lyons refers to the introduction and emphasizes the great respect that he has for spiritual leaders, and that he is not one. Chief Lyons also clarifies that he cannot speak for all the Indian nations, but that they do have a common understanding, ethic, and spiritual experience in regards to the land and the earth. The lecture touches on the irony of white men trying to eradicate the indigenous peoples' way of life, but then requiring guidance from those peoples, guidance they are only able to provide because of their way of life. Frustration at false spiritual leaders and 'shammans' is expressed and a reminder is given that this is a selfish and cheap way to treat the traditions held for so long by many people. The spiritual law of the Native Americans is explained and emphisis is laid on maintaining stable life support systems, namely water resources. History is given to detail the treaties forged between the founding fathers and the Native Americans. The lecture emphasizes our responsibilities to honor the treaties that our fore-fathers signed. This goal can be accomplished, it will take hard work but Chief Lyons thinks we are capable, we have a common cause, the future of wilderness and the rest of the earth.",1989-04-20,,lectures; indigenous people; wilderness;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl10,application/pdf,text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Illustrations by Lorraine Ashland  Foreword  James R. Fazio  T he wilderness resource distinguished lecture by Chief Oren  Lyons is an historic occasion. I say this for two reasons. First,  it is the tenth presentation in the Wilderness Resource Distinguished  Lecture Series sponsored by the University of Idaho Wilderness Re­search  Center. This is a real milestone, and it is a tribute to the vision  of former dean John Ehrenreich who initiated the series in 1'177.  I remember our first discussion about what we hoped would be an­nual  visits by prominent individuals associated with wilderness. Dean  Ehrenreich's view was that the University of Idaho could and should be  a national leader not only in the scientific investigation of wilderness  but also in wilderness education. As he envisioned the lecture series, it  would be one of the ways the Wilderness Research Center could intelli­gently  examine the problems, the values, and the opportunities of  wilderness areas after they have been established through the political  and legislative process.  The series began in 1'177 with Senator Frank Church speaking to a  standing-room-only crowd in the ballroom of the Student Union Build­ing  and to a live, state-wide television audience. His subject was  ""Wilderness in a Balanced Land Use Framework."" The next year our  speaker was Roderick Nash, historian and author of Wilderness and the  American Mind, who spoke of ""Wilderness Management: A Contradic­tion  in Terms?"" He was followed in 1'179 by Secretary of the Interior  Cecil D. Andrus who proposed a reorganization of the U.S. Forest  Service and Bureau of Land Management into a Department of Natural  Resources and discussed the reorganization's implications for wilder­ness.  In 1980 we went from the large scale to the smaller scale with  Patrick F. Noonan, former president of The Nature Conservancy, who  talked about his organization's work to preserve natural diversity and  America's natural heritage. The following year our speaker was Russell  E. Dickenson, director of the National Park Service, who addressed the  subject ""Wilderness Values in the National Parks."" Then, in 1982, au­thor  Michael Frome asked rhetorically if the ""battle for the wilder­ness""  would be ""our forever conflict.""  In 1983, we hosted the First National Conference on Wilderness  Management and heard from the directors of all four major land  management agencies-the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land  Management, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service-who addressed issues of wilderness management facing their  organizations.  In 1984, congressional candidate and former vice president of the  National Audubon Society Brock Evans presented an essay titled ""In  Celebration of Wilderness: The Progress and the Promise.""  We then broke the annual sequence for two years, reviving it in 1987  with Jay D. Hair, president of the nation's largest conservation organi­zation,  the National Wildlife Federation, who spoke about ""Wilderness:  Promises, Poetry, and Pragmatism."" Finally, last year we went interna­tional  with Ian Player of South Africa, founder of the Wilderness  Leadership School and World Wilderness Congress, who provided his  perspective on ""Using Wilderness Experiences to Enhance Human  Potential and Understanding.""  Besides being the landmark tenth in this series of truly distinguished  lectures, the 1989 presentation is historic because for the first time­and  long overdue-we receive a Native American perspective on  wilderness. Those of us in the Wilderness Research Center are particu­larly  pleased and honored to have Chief Oren Lyons make this contri­bution  to the Wilderness Resource Distinguished Lecture Series.  Dr. James R. Fazio is head of the Department of Wildland Recreation  Management and acting director of the Wilderness Research Center.  ii  Introduction  John C. Hendee  Ladies and gentle~en, welcome to our 1989 wilderness resource  distinguished lecture. Tonight it's my privilege to introduce  Chief Oren Lyons, professor in the Department of American Studies  and director of Native American studies at the State University of New  York at Buffalo.  Oren is Turtle Clan chief in the Onondaga Nation of the Iroquois  Confederacy. He is truly an international leader of indigenous people,  representing them on the Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary  Leaders for Global Survival. During the past 12 months Chief Lyons  has conferred and spoken in the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada,  England, South Africa, and Lesotho.  Oren Lyons has been a leader in all his endeavors. He was an all­American  lacrosse player on a national championship team at Syracuse  University. He is an outstanding artist, worked as a free-lance sports il­lustrator,  and rose through the ranks of Norcross greeting card  company to become its planning director, guiding the efforts of 180  artists. In 1970, having been named a chief in the Onondaga Nation, he  walked away from his Madison Avenue executive responsibilities to  work for the cause of Indian people.  Last year, it was my great pleasure to travel for three weeks with  Chief Oren Lyons in Africa, reviewing the condition of wilderness and  wildlife reserves and the plight of nearby indigenous people. There I  had the great pleasure of experiencing Chief Lyons's compassion, in­sight,  wisdom, appreciation for indigenous cultures and ways of life,  and also his sense of humor and personal warmth.  Early in our trip, while we were recovering from jet lag, I was  awakened by Chiefs hand on my shoulder. He whispered, ""Come with  me, and let's greet the new day.""  iii  We trudged to the beach of the Indian Ocean, less than a mile from  the Mozambique border, where during the night we had heard gun fire  and seen occasional flashes of explosions from the continuing civil war.  There he led me and others in our party in a beautiful ceremony:  greeting the sun with a sharp yell to get the attention of the creator and  all of the animals and then sending messages of hope, in turn, to each  direction. We then shared smoke from tobacco, grown from seeds  handed down for 10,000 years or more among his people.  The significance of this beautiful and inspiring ceremony was to  greet the new day and, before it was sullied by a cross word or a jeal­ous  thought, to pledge oneself to do the best that one could in all ef­forts  that day. It was an inspiring experience and one that we repeated  at every opportunity during the rest of our trip. It reflected Chief Oren  Lyons's appreciation for people and animals as part of the earth, the  creator, spiritual life, and the holistic view we associate with  wilderness.  It gives me great pleasure to introduce my distinguished friend and  colleague, Chief Oren Lyons.  John C Hendee is dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range  Sciences at the University of Idaho.  iv  The Ma.ple  v  vi  WILDERNESS IN  NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE  Chief Oren Lyons  Neyawenha skano: Thank you for being well, for being here.  During the introduction, as John was telling about our trip and  the ceremony that I did my best to carry through, I reflected on what I  would consider to be spiritual people. And I would like you to know  that I do not consider myself a spiritual leader. Because I know the  spiritual leaders that we depend on, and I know the knowledge, ex­perience,  commitment, and sacrifice that it takes to be one. I know  these spiritual leaders, and I'm very grateful for them.  And with the help and support of my friend Bob Staffanson, I've  been working with the traditional Circle of Elders for many years,  gathering these leaders together annually to talk about the health and  welfare of our Mother Earth and also to consider what needs to be  done for the millions of people who live on our Mother Earth and all  of the life that abounds. So annually we struggle to get this meeting to­gether,  and through Bob's good effort it has occurred every year.  We will be meeting in Haida-Gwaii this year, in mid-June, and we'll  be meeting with varieties of people. Who knows? It's always a guess to  us who will arrive. And the young people are very much involved in  this, and they were intent this year, wherever we were going to meet,  on building a meetinghouse for the elders. They wanted to go there  ahead of time and build this meetinghouse and gather up the young  people who live there and do this in respect for the people who were  coming.  Now I don't know whether they're going to be able to accomplish  that. Our meeting came forward much earlier than usual, so we'll just  have to wait and see, but I thought that their initiative and their  effort-because this was their idea, what they wanted to do-was im­portant  because it gives direction to young people in relation to things  that have to be done throughout this world. And it also reminds the  elders of the energy and the needs of young people in this world and  the directions that they are seeking and the need for guidance and  leadership.  And so, I wanted to remind everyone that this title, spiritual leader,  is a very sacred one; it demands great respect, and not too many can  carry that title. So with that I'll begin the discussion.  And I start with a greeting, the ancient greeting from my nation:  N eyawenha skano, ""Thank you for being well."" It's a greeting of our  people and recognition of good health. And I extend this greeting on  behalf of my people to all who are here and even to those who cannot  be here.  And I want to thank you for allowing me to address this forum, the  Wilderness Resource Distinguished Lecture Series. My thanks and ap­preciation  to my host, the University of Idaho Wilderness Research  Center, and in particular to my friend and colleague, the dean of the  College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, John Hendee.  The title ""Wilderness in Native American Culture"" is all-inclusive. I  can only address you with my limited knowledge in this sphere. You  must understand that no one can speak for all the Indian nations in this  Great Thrtle Island. I can only relate to you the experiences of the na­tive  peoples of these lands because we have a common understanding  and ethic about this great land we call Mother Earth.  We share a common reverence and love for our lands, and we have  hundreds of distinct languages and dialects, and we have prayers and  ceremonies to honor these commitments and duties to the spiritual  forces and powers that prevail over all life. We believe in the creation  and the creator, the giver of all life.  Cycles of Ceremony and Song  The traditional life styles of the indigenous peoples of these lands are  endless cycles of ceremony and song, commemorating all aspects of the  2  creation. Though our languages are different, our prayers and ceremo­nies  honor the same spiritual powers. In spite of the combined efforts  of our white brothers over five centuries to change us and to replace  our ways with theirs, we still endure and continue our ceremonies  locked in with the seasons and cycles of life; we continue to survive.  It is interesting to me how attitudes are now beginning to change:  how the same churches and their leaders who missionized our people,  took our children, forbade them to speak their languages, forbade our  people to carry through our ancient ceremonies, captured and destroyed  our religious items and sacred objects, these same people are now sit­ting  down with us in a common effort to survive. It's ironic that in  these discussions they are probing for knowledge and understanding of  these lands and the natural forces of nature. Ironic because the sources  of this know ledge are in the languages, ceremonies, and cultures of our  people that they spent 500 years trying to change and destroy.  In 1981, I was invited to participate as a speaker in a gathering in  New Zealand called the Namibasa Festival with an amazing collection  of religious leaders, environmentalists, alternative life style specialists,  musicians, and people concerned for the environment, not the least of  whom included Chuck Daniels and Dizzy Gillespie. The organizers had  asked the Maori people to act as security for the event, and naturally I  spent a lot of time with these Maoris.  We stood there one bright and sunny day observing the scene in  amazement, seeing at least half of the 30,000 people there were not  wearing any clothes, and my Maori brother said, ""Look at that: They  spent the past 200 years taking the paint off our faces and getting us to  wear clothes, and now they wear the paint and no clothes."" I thought  that was an interesting observation.  The So-Called Medicine Men  As one of the members of the traditional Circle of Elders and Youth,  I listen to complaints from Indian people from all parts of the continent  who say that their sacred ceremonies and sacred ceremonial objects,  such as pipes, feathers, and symbols, have been appropriated by so­called  medicine men and women who purport to be shamans and  spiritual advisers and leaders carrying out ceremonies that they say  they learned from some mysterious Indian medicine man or woman.  And all kinds of people buy into this, literally paying hundreds of dol­lars  for sweat lodges and vision quests among other things. · Most of  3  these so-called medicine men are not Indians, but a few are, greed and  avarice unfortunately being a common denominator among all peoples.  Now this has become a major problem among all of our people be­cause  they feel that their sacred ceremonies have been appropriated  without their consent and misused commercially, not to say spiritually.  I don't feel responsible for any adults who wish to spend their money  on such things, but I am concerned about this feeling of being betrayed  by those Indians who indulge in this and by those non-Indian ""sha­mans""  who for commercial gain purport to use our methods and  ceremonies. This goes on around the world, and we hear of sun dances  being held in Germany, Holland, Austria, and in other places.  Seeking a Spiritual Uily  There's another side to this that I think is important. Many of the  people are young, many are involved in the ""New Age"" phenomenon  occurring all over the Western world, and many are just seeking. It  seems to me they are seeking a spiritual way; it seems to me that they  are not satisfied with the organized religions that they were brought up  with and that there is a general dissatisfaction with organized  religions-a sort of spiritual bankruptcy of the church. These are my  observations, and I could be far off the mark, but I have been traveling  considerably, and it's pretty consistent. In fact, I'm amazed at the con­sistency  of this particular phenomenon.  Since I am an Indian chief they often come to me wherever I go, and  they seek the wisdom of our grandfathers. They believe we have a wis­dom  and a power, and they search for the security of a belief, and this  reflects the sad state of affairs that prevails around the world.  Tatanga Mani  Tatanga Mani or ""Walking Buffalo,"" a Stoney Indian from Canada,  said at an address in London, England, in 1958:  Hills are always more beautiful than stone buildings, you know. Living in a  city is an artificial existence. Lots of people hardly ever feel real soil under  their feet, see plants grow except in flower pots, or get far enough beyond the  street light to catch the enchantment of a night sky studded with stars. When  people live far from scenes of the Great Spirit's making, it's easy for them to  forget his laws.  4  Then he went on to say:  We were a lawless people, but we were on pretty good terms with the Great  Spirit, creator and ruler of all. You whites assumed we were savages. You  didn't understand our prayers. You didn't try to understand. When we sang our  praises to the sun or moon or wind, you said we were worshipping idols. With­out  understanding, you condemned us as lost souls just because our form of  worship was different from yours.  We saw the Great Spirit's work in almost everything: sun, moon, trees, wind,  and mountains. Sometimes we approached him through these things. Was that  so bad? I think we have a true belief in the supreme being, a stronger faith  than that of most whites who have called us pagans . . . Indians living close to  nature and nature's ruler are not living in darkness.  Did you know that trees talk? Well they do. They talk to each other, and  they'll talk to you if you listen. Trouble is, white people don't listen. They  never learned to listen to the Indians so I don't suppose they'll listen to other  voices in nature. But I have learned a lot from trees: sometimes about the  weather, sometimes about animals, sometimes about the Great Spirit.  This man died in 1967, not too long ago, a grandfather to all, a man  of wisdom and compassion. He said we were lawless, and then he went  on to recount some of our laws: The law of love and respect, the duties  of ceremony, the understanding that the creator made all things and  therefore we must respect them, the law of stillness and quiet to listen  and to learn. He spoke of many things in that short speech, things that  we should reflect upon.  Our people had many such speakers down through the centuries of  our coexistence here on these lands, and they spoke often, but no one  listened, or cared to. The white people didn't understand why we called  the four winds our grandfathers, the moon our grandmother, the sun  our uncle or father, or the earth our mother. They didn't understand  how we wanted to draw as close to them as we could, like our family.  How we loved them, and all that they did for us.  They didn't understand how we were instructed by song and ceremo­ny  to give a great thanksgiving for all of these things. We the Iroquois  have been told that our primary duty is to carry through the great  ceremonies of thanksgiving for all of these things-the chief of the  trees, the maple; the chief of the fruits, the strawberry; the corn,  beans, and squash (the three sisters)-the harvest thanksgiving and the  great mid-winter festival that ties the year together in one bundle and  prepares us for the next season.  5  A Spiritual Law  We have instructions that continue to direct our lives. At one time  this hemisphere was peopled by nations who understood the great law  and abided by these laws. The lands were clean, the water was pure,  and the air was crystal clear. It would be hard to describe the pristine  beauty of these lands or the abundance of fish and animal life. There  was a general peace that prevailed because there was an adherence to  law, ancient and unwritten, a great spiritual law.  All nations lived as free people, from the youngest to the eldest, and  these thousands of communities were governed by these natural laws.  We are blood, flesh, and bone, and we are bound by the same laws of  all blood, flesh, and bone; all growing life is bound by these laws, and  the first of these laws is water.  Water is necessary for life, water that we take for granted. But we  are now being faced with some stark realities of this particular law. We  take rain for granted, but now see that we cannot take any water source  for granted.  We Indians have ceremonies for the thunder and the lightning that  bring the rain that waters the earth. We call the thundering voices our  grandfathers, and we greet the first thunder of the new season with a  ceremony of thanksgiving because they have returned to continue their  duties to water the earth and the life upon this earth and to freshen the  springs, streams, lakes, and oceans. We respect this great source of life  and have special ways to acknowledge it.  Our ceremonies may seem, at times, barbaric or quaint to some, but  we love them. The familiarity of ancient songs to commemorate our fi­delity  to these laws and these ceremonies breeds respect, an attitude of  humble gratitude, something that I think is sorely lacking in contem­porary  society.  We must protect and defend our water resources because we are ac­countable  to our corning generations, to our children and to their  grandchildren. So then it is attitudes that we must change. It is  philosophies that put economic gains in the short term ahead of stabi­lized  life support systems in the long term that threaten life as we know  it. We must question the motives of our leaders today, wherever they  are. We must not despair because we think we are powerless, because  we do have power: the power of the people with one mind, with one  purpose, one heart, the power of unity.  6  A long time ago, the great peacemaker came to my people, long be­fore  Columbus made his landfall in these lands. And this great man  brought to the Haudenosaunee these ideas that are now ancient, but at  the same time as new and as fresh as spring-these great principles of  peace and freedom. He gave us our government, the constitution of the  Haudenosaunee that united the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga,  Thscarora, and Seneca into the great Iroquois Confederacy that con­tinues  to stand today.  He planted the great tree of peace with the four white roots of truth  reaching out in the four cardinal directions of the earth, instructing any  of those who are lost and have nowhere to go to follow those roots  back to their source and sit under the great long leaves of the tree of  peace.  Vision of a Free Nation  We shared these principles with the founding fathers of the United  States of America and helped raise you up as a free and independent  nation. The person who saw this possibility, who had the vision to  think of a free nation, was Benjamin Franklin. In 1744, at what is now  Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a meeting was held between the Six Nations's  chiefs and the governors of several of the colonies. An Onondaga chief  exhorted the governors to gather themselves together like the Six Na­tions  and bind themselves together as one. He told them they would  never get anywhere fighting one another as they were doing, and they  should follow the example of the Haudenosaunee.  7  The man keeping the minutes and records of that particular meeting  was Benjamin Franklin. It was he who had the vision of a free nation,  and it was he who said, ""Why not?"" He called together the Albany  Plan of Union 10 years later, and he asked the Six Nations's chiefs to  be there and explain union and government.  Later, in 1775, commissioners from the Continental Congress came to  Iroquois country and asked for a meeting with the confederacy, which  was granted. At that meeting they asked that the Six Nations remain  neutral in the coming conflict, and we saw this conflict as a battle be­tween  father and son, and we agreed. They said at that time, and I  quote from the records of the Continental Congress, ""We live upon the  same ground as you. The same island [Thrtle Island] is our common  birth place. We desire to sit down under the same tree of peace with  you; let us water its roots and cherish its growth, till the large leaves  and flourishing branches shall extend to the setting sun and reach the  skies.""  And so it was that they took our advice and began a new nation  predicated on peace, equality, and freedom-ancient principles to all  Indian nations. And on these lands in 1776, two commissioners, George  Morgan and Simon Girty, came to Fort Pitt in July and brought a great  wampum belt with 13 diamonds designating the 13 fires of their new  union and commemorated a peace with the Haudenosaunee on the eve  of the revolution.  And in the discussion, they asked that we not be involved. And our  chiefs said, ""We agree, and we must ask you not to invite our young  men to fight with you. Do not seek them out. And leave us in peace.  And we like your suggestion so well that we're going to send chiefs  with your men and this belt, and we'll carry it through the Great Lakes  to the other nations."" And they did.  The First Treaty  This was the first treaty the United States made in its new history as  a nation. Subsequently it made many more, but unfortunately for the  Indian nations, as our white brother grew stronger, he began to dis­regard  his promises.  In 1915, in Supreme Court testimony concerning the validity of the  Walla Walla treaty of 1855 with the Yakimas, Chief Weninock of the  Yakimas explained what happened at Walla Walla, and he told how  8  Chief Kamiaken spoke after Governor Stevens asked him why he was  so silent for so many days, and Kamiaken replied, ""I am afraid that the  white men are not speaking straight; that their children will not do  what is right by our children; that they will not do what you have  promised for them."" And that's why he was so silent. He was another  man of vision.  You are those children. He was speaking about you. And he said he  didn't think you were going to keep your promise, and it seems that's  the way it is.  So it comes to laws again, yours and ours. It comes to respect for  the women and love for the children to see if we shall endure on this  earth as people.  Wilderness  I will close with a quotation about wilderness. You reflect and be the  judges of its contents.  We did not think of the great open plains, the beautiful rolling hills, and  winding streams with tangled growth as ""wild."" Only to the white man was na­ture  a ""wilderness"" and only to him was the land ""infested"" with ""wild""  animals and ""savage"" people. To us it was tame. Earth was bountiful and we  were surrounded with the blessings of the Great Mystery. Not until the hairy  man from the east came and with brutal frenzy heaped injustices upon us and  the families we loved was it ""wild"" for us. When the very animals of the forest  began fleeing from his approach, then it was that for us the ""Wild West""  began.  This was Chief Luther Standing Bear, Oglala Sioux Nation. It's a  comment on wilderness. So it's how you look at it. When the landfall  occurred at Plymouth Rock, the Pilgrims looked at the great pines of  New England, and they called it the ""Dark Continent."" They were  afraid of the same great pines that surround us, what's left of them.  And so it's all in perception, how you look at things.  Now it's spring. The wild onions are up; the leeks are up; every­body's  out picking. Fish are running. And the Indians are out gather­ing,  still gathering today. The greens that grow, the new food of the  new year, our people are out gathering. The dandelions in my mother's  yard are not safe from her stew pot; she will be out immediately, as  soon as they come up. The cowslips, all of these things that we enjoy  9  so much and have enjoyed for years and years, the berries, are all com­ing.  And the people are tuned into this. Our people go out and gather  them, they still gather. They still make the soup; they still make the  greens; still in touch. And as the elder said, ""When you separate your­self  from the reality, then you lose touch, and you become insensitive,  and it becomes easier to challenge these great forces.""  A Common Cause  Today we have a common cause; we have to look out for the life  coming-for your children, for my children. We are accountable; they  will hold us accountable. When they're suffering in the coming times,  they will look back upon us and say, ""Why did they do this to us?""  This is what we have to consider.  There's still time. Around the world it's the same. As John Hendee  has said, I've been in the four corners. The feeling is the same; the  people are the same; the issue is the same: Is there going to be a  future for our young people?  And it comes back to one of the old prophecies from the Six Na­tions.  We had a third visionary called Guaniiyodiyoh, ""Handsome  Lake."" And he was told many things, around 1799. But as he had  listened and after he had observed and been shown all of these things,  he said, ""This is very discouraging. Is this all going to happen?"" And  the Four Spiritual Beings said to him, ""We believe what you have seen  is true and will come about. Just don't let it be your generation, be­cause  the generation that allows this to happen will suffer beyond all  comprehension.""  And so, in a word, the creator threw the ball back into our lap and  simply said it's up to you when this will occur. And so we have to put  aside thoughts of our own comfort, of our own security, of our own fu­ture,  and think in terms of the instructions that we were given as chiefs  of the confederacy, which are to make all decisions on behalf of, and  in regard to, the Seventh Generation to come.  With that kind of vision, and with that kind of motive, I don't think  it's too late. But it's a lot of work. We have to set aside our differ­ences,  and we have to work together as one people, one family, for the  future of Mother Earth. Dahnayto.

A Vision for Wilderness in the National Forests,William A. Worf,"Lecture given by William A. Worf, President of Wilderness Watch. Opening remarks given by Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe, principal scientist for the Wilderness Research Center and associate professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introduction by John C. Hendee, dean of the Collefe of Forestry, Wildlife and Rancge Sciences, and acting director of the Wilderness Reseach Center. The lecture opens with the story of Aldo Leopold and others who inspired the idea of wilderness in the United States. How wilderness has been percieved and protected in the 60's is then given a brief description, including the operations and vision of a task force put into effect by the Forest Service after the Wilderness Act is passed. The struggle of defining how to manage wilderness differently than a recreation area is portrayed. The lecture shows hope in the way wilderness will be prioritized by the Forest Service in the future and steps to be taken to assure that comes about. The lecture concludes with the concept as wilderness being the central vision of the Forest Service in the 21st century.

Krumpe  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the eleventh  in the annual series of Wilderness Resource Distinguished  Lectureships sponsored by the University of Idaho Wilderness  Research Center.  The center's mission is to promote research and educational  activities to further our understanding of wilderness and natu­ral  ecosystems and man's relationships to them. Our goal is to  gain knowledge that can be applied to better manage our  designated wilderness areas so that the public can enjoy the  sustained use and benefits from an enduring resource of  wilderness.  Over the years the center has sponsored and co-sponsored  a variety of research projects in Idaho and the Pacific North­west,  and Alaska as well. Much of our wildlife-related re­search  has taken place at the center's Taylor Ranch Field  Station in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.  The center has an educational mission as well as that of re­search.  In addition to sponsoring the First National Wilder­ness  Management Workshop in 1983, we have produced  publications, given guest lectures, and conducted workshops  around the country.  In 1977 the Wilderness Research Center inaugurated the  Wilderness Resource Distinguished Lectureship series. In the  years since, national experts at the forefront of wilderness is­sues  and management have shared their experiences and  viewpoints on wilderness.  iii  Tonight's distinguished lecture is special because it is the  first in a series of four lectures that will present ""visions for  wilderness"" in the four federal agencies that manage wilder­ness  -the Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of  Land Management, and Fish and Wildlife Service. During the  next two years, leading authorities fami I iar with the wilder­ness  potential of lands managed by these agencies will pres­ent  visions of how that potential can be realized.  Dr. Krumpe is principal scientist for the Wilderness Research  Center and associate professor in the Department of Resource  Recreation and Tourism.  iv  , --  Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona  Introduction of Bill Woif  by  John C Hendee, Dean  I'm very pleased to introduce you this evening to Mr. Bill  Worf, the eleventh speaker in the Distinguished Wilderness  Resource Lectureship series. Bill Worf is president and founder  of Wilderness Watch, a nonprofit national organization dedi­cated  to protecting and enhancing the nation's designated  Wildernesses and Wild and Scenic Rivers.  Bill retired from the Forest Service in 1981 from the position  of Director of Recreation for the Northern Rocky Mountain re­gion  where he led the agency's largest wilderness program.  In 1989 Bill founded Wilderness Watch. Until that time, no  national organization had accepted responsibility for manage­ment  of the nation's designated Wildernesses and Wild and  Scenic Rivers. The organization's membership now extends  across 35 states and includes as corporate members some of  the nation's most active environ mental and conservation  groups.  Wilderness Watch tracks wilderness appropriations and  spending. It provides education programs for the public and  for agencies and policymakers. It monitors Wilderness and  Wild and Scenic Rivers management programs to ensure com-  . pliance with the laws, policy, and regulations under which  these resources are protected. It monitors Wilderness and  Wild and Scenic Rivers on the ground to determine whether  their values are being damaged by improper management or  use. It promotes wilderness management as an evolving natu­ral  resource specialty. It advocates the preservation and use of  primitive skills and promotes the minimum tool concept for  wilderness maintenance. And it promotes informed pub I ic  vi  particpation in management decisions to ensure their gui­dance  of our nation's Wilderness and Wild and Scenic River  systems.  I can't think of a more committed, more knowledgeable  person to lead such activities than Bill Worf. A 30-year-plus  Forest Service veteran, Bill was among the first wilderness  advocates in the natural resource management professions.  Throughout his Forest Service career-as a forest supervisor, as  national branch chief for wilderness, as a regional director of  recreation-Bill Worf has been an active and powerful voice­for  high quality wilderness and wilderness management.  Bill Worf doesn't make things easy. He's an uncompromising  advocate for wilderness in its purest form. Few agencies or  groups involved in wilderness have escaped his critical view.  He's a hard man to ignore. Bill challenges all of us as  citizens to get involved in wilderness issues. He challenges us  as scientists to conduct research that adheres to the highest  principles of being ""light on the land:' He challenges us as  managers-the Forest Service, the BLM, the National Park  Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service-to approach our  responsibilities courageously and tough-mindedly. And he  challenges all of us who love the wild country to meet  wilderness on its own terms, and to treat it always with re­spect.  Bill Worf can make us uncomfortable. He doesn't mind. He  has a vision. A vision of a nation capable of recognizing the  beauty and the necessity of its wild places.  Wilderness Watch uses as a motto Thoreau's declaration  that ""in Wildness is the preservation of the World"" (Walking,  1862). Bill Worf wants to keep wilderness wild!  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our Distinguished  Wilderness Resource Lecturer, Mr. Bill Worf.  john C. Hendee is dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences, and acting director of the Wilderness Re­search  Center.  vii  A VISION FOR  WILDERNESSES IN THE  NATIONAL FORESTS  William A. Worf  Before we peek into the future let's take a glance into the  past and look at the present.  In 1913 (nearly 79 years ago) two men were riding the head­waters  of the Pacos River in the Carson National Forest. The  ""leader"" propounded the idea of setting aside large areas of  undeveloped country and preserving them as wilderness. This  was Aldo Leopold, supervisor of the Carson National Forest,  later to become assistant district forester in the Southwest and  still later a renowned ecologist and father of the modern  profession of wildlife management. The other man was Elliot  Barker-then a district ranger, later supervisor of the Carson  National Forest, and then long time commissioner or director  of Parks and Game in New Mexico. He was a legendary out­doorsman,  author of a number of outdoor books.  The Original Vision  Years later Barker recorded the incident in a letter (August  12, 1959) to Senator Clinton B. Anderson who piloted the  Wilderness Bill through the Senate to passage in 1964. Thus  was recorded the first known expression of the wilderness  dream. In 1921 Leopold published. his concept of wilderness  in the November issue of the journal of Forestry in an article  entitled ""The Wilderness and Its Place in Forest Recreation  Policy:' He developed his concept of wilderness in considera­ble  detail (which is remarkably similar to the principles even­tually  defined in the Wilderness Act). He defined ""wilderness""  as ""a continuous stretch of country preserved in its natural  state, open to lawful hunting and fishing, big enough to ab­sorb  a two weeks pack trip and kept devoid of roads, artificial  trails, cottages or other works of man:' Among other things,  he suggested a wilderness of at least 500,000 acres be estab­lished  in each of the 11 states west of the Great Plains.  In May of 1922, Leopold made an inspection trip into the  headwaters of the Gila River. Soon thereafter he wrote a  wilderness plan for the area that excluded roads and addition­al  use permits, except grazing. His plans allowed for trails and  telephone lines needed in case of forest fires. Leopold's plan  encountered opposition from some of his colleagues in the  district office who thought that resource use and development  should take precedence over preservation. However, on june  3, 1924, District Forester Frank C.W. Pooler approved  Leopold's concept. The Gila area was placed under a ten-year  wilderness recreation policy. Roads were to be limited and ef­forts  were to be made to acquire private inholdings through  land exchanges. Grazing and water power developments were  not to be impeded. Pooler's action did not carry any immedi­ate  national significance because the Forest Service's Washing­ton  (D.C.) office was not involved in the decision.  Leopold left the southwest in 1924 to work at the Forest  Service's Forest Products Laboratory, and later at the University  of Wisconsin. As a result of his original thinking about wilder­ness  and his early pioneering efforts, Leopold is widely  regarded as the father of the ""wilderness concept:'  This distinction is ""challenged"" by Donald N. Caldwin in­""  The Quiet Revolution"" in which he develops the thesis that  Arthur Carhart was the true father of the wilderness concept.  Determination as to who was the true father of the wilderness  concept is not important here. What is important is that both  2  of these men were Forest Service officers and their ideas took  root and grew in the United States Forest Service.  Implementing the Vision  Forest Service annual reports from 1921 to 1929 reflect an  increasing awareness of the importance of recreation, and be­ginning  in 1926, single out wilderness for special discussions.  In 1926 Chief William B. Greeley wrote: ""The wilderness idea  has merit and deserves careful study, but its correlation with  the other obligations and requirements of national forest ad­ministration  must be carefully worked out before definite  steps are taken to give any areas a wilderness status:' One  year later Greeley was writing more positively about wilder­ness:  ""The Forest Service plans to withhold these areas from  unnecessary road building and forms of special use of a com­mercial  character which would impair their wilderness  character:'  In 1926 Greeley and Assistant Forester for Lands Leon  Kneipp ordered an inventory of all national forest undeve­loped  areas larger than 230,400 acres, i.e. ten townships or  more. A few years ago the Forest Service conducted what it  called the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation we know as  RARE II. How many of you knew that RARE I was actually  started in 1926? Three years later wilderness policy assumed  national scope with the promulgation of the L-20 Regulations  authorizing the establishment of ""primitive"" areas. This was  later replaced by Regulations U-1 and U-2. U-1 provided for  the study and reclassification of primitive areas as ""wilder­nesses""  or ""wild areas:' U-2 provided for the continued estab­lishment  and management of primitive areas.  By the time the Wilderness Act passed in 1964, the Forest  Service had established 54 areas totalling 9.1 million acres of  wilderness, wild, or canoe areas. These were accepted as the  nucleus of the National Wilderness Preservation System. In  addition, 34 primitive areas remained to be studied.  3  Applying the Wilderness Act on the  National Forests  The Forest Service had a proud history in wilderness and  the leaders in place in 1964 were committed to build on that.  When the Wilderness Act passed, the Forest Service had to  start implementing it instantly-we had the only instant  Wilderness. Accordingly, Dick Costley, then director of recrea­tion  in the Washington office, put together a six-man task  force to develop the regulations and policy guidelines neces­sary  to meet the mandates of Congress. On that task force  were a district ranger from the Sierra National Forest in  California, Arn Snyder; the wilderness staff from Region 1 in  Missoula, Ed Slusher; the wilderness staff from Region 6 in  Portland, George Williams; and the Bridger National Forest  supervisor from Wyoming, myself. We were on the job Sep­tember  20. Dick sequestered us in the attic of an ancient  building that has since been renovated and now houses the  national office of the Forest Service. We were under the  leadership of a chap from Costley's staff, Gordon Hammond,  and our resident legal counsel was Bill Brizee, a lawyer from  the Office of the General Counsel. Chief Ed Cliff, Associate  Chief Art Greeley, and Dick Costley all spent a lot of time  with us.  The Chief's Vision for Wilderness  My memory of the first meeting the task force had with Ed  Cliff are still vivid. We really hadn't settled down to work  yet-it was either the second or third day. The chief came to  our attic workroom. Dick Costley was also there and the  meeting lasted a full half day. Ed leaned back in his chair  smoking his pipe and put his feet up on the table while his  philosophy and expectations-his vision-rolled out. I even  remember that he had a hole through the outer sole on one  of his shoes. This somehow seemed to reassure me of this  man's honesty, sincerity, and credibility. His message had four  major points.  4  First, wilderness must be distinctive. There needed to be a  real difference between how the Forest Service did things in a  designated Wilderness as compared with the management of  other non-roaded lands outside of wilderness. This included  not only the kinds of tools and methods used, but also the  types and scope of projects undertaken. He said that visitors  had a right to expect that they would be able to sense that  difference soon after crossing the boundary into the wilder­ness.  He pointed out that the American people, through Con­gress,  had seen fit to invest about eight percent of the  National Forest System in this wilderness concept, and that  investment would be wasted if these lands were not managed  to be distinctive and special. I recall that he predicted our in­vestment  of National Forest land to the Wilderness System  would grow to at least 10 percent before the Primitive Area  Review was complete. We know now that he really underesti­mated  the people's commitment to wilderness: it is now clear  that more than 20 percent of the National Forest System will  eventually be in the National Wilderness Preservation System.  Ed's second point was that management of wilderness was  an integral part of management of the entire National Forest  System. Our success with maintaining an enduring resource  of wilderness for future generations depended on how we  managed the surrounding National Forest land. To emphasize  that point, he gave us the following quote from a paper by  Howard Zahnizer, the great wilderness champion who  shepherded the Wilderness Act through Congress as leader of  the Wilderness Society: ""Not only is wilderness preservation  consistent with the multiple-use principle-the best apparent  hope for success in the preservation of such areas, including  wilderness, is in application of the multiple-use principle:' He  also said, ""To preserve some areas free from timber cutting  will require adequate timber production on other areas.  Preserving natural areas undeveloped with recreation facilities  will require adequate provision of developed areas with the  access and facilities needed by the large numbers seeking  outdoor recreation with conveniences .. .. ""  Ed's third point was that the Forest Service organization  must be the leader in demonstrating the ""wilderness way"" of  traveling and working in these special places. This was the  5  beginning of what we now call the minimum tool concept.  He particularly stressed the need for forest officers to demon­strate  the impact ways of using stock. He told the story of a  trip he had taken earlier that year with Secretary of Agricul­ture  Orville Freeman. It was into the Sawtooth Mountains of  Idaho which were at that time being considered for National  Park designation. As I recall, the story went something like  fhis. The party pulled into camp in the early evening. The  camp had been set up in advance overlooking a beautiful and  I ush green meadow. The stock were put back in the trees. The  party enjoyed dinner and talk around the fire while the  shadows stretched across the meadow and the dusk deepened  into darkness. It was a scene of the kind that dreams are  made of. The secretary retired to his tent and the stock were  hobbled and turned into the meadow to graze. Apparently the  meadow was a I ittle wet and when the secretary emerged  from his tent in the morning, the pristine meadow from the  night before had been transformed into a trampled muddy  horse pasture. According to Ed, Mr. Freeman was very upset  and let it be known that he expected better treatment of the  land by Forest Service people.  Several times before I left the Washington office I saw Ed  use the Forest Service commitment to a minimum tool ap­proach  to wilderness to close the discussion on some issue.  Following are a couple examples:  Some officers of a major oil company called on Ed to con­vince  him that their geologists should be allowed to travel in  the wilderness by helicopter to make their assessment of oil  and gas potential. They used all the usual arguments, i.e. use  of helicopters is state of the art, modern day geologists just  would not walk, it would be prohibitively expensive, etc. The  discussion went back and forth for about two hours, getting  no place. Finally Ed leaned forward, slammed his fist on the  table and said, ""Our guys are out there maintaining trails with  cross-cut saws and by God your guys can walk:' The meeting  was over and the geologists walked.  On another time we had been in prolonged discussions with  the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) about the use of helicop­ters  for measuring snow. One day Ed called me and said he  was having lunch in the executive dining room with the  6  Director of the SCS. He invited me to join them. The lunch  was about over and the conversation had only been pleasant  small talk. Finally Ed brought up the snow measurement is­sue.  He said that he recognized that some SCS employees  might not have the skill or physical ability to make these long  tough trips on snow shoes or skis. However he said the Forest  Service people were used to such travel and that in wilder­nesses  the Forest Service would make the measurements for  the SCS if they wished. I was instructed to draw up an agree­ment  to that effect.  The chief's fourth point was that we had to keep in mind  that we are to manage these special areas in accordance  with the Wilderness Act. He cautioned us to put aside our  personal philosophies and base our policy recommendations  on the letter and spirit of the act. He pointed out that the act  was full of compromises and at first reading one might be­lieve  it is full of contradictions. He said we should not be led  astray by the compromises and special provisions because  they were narrowly and very specifically drawn to meet a par­ticular  objective and did not weaken the general provisions of  the act. He admonished us to always keep the first four lines  in Section 2(a) uppermost in our minds___!'ln order to assure  that an increasing population, accompanied by expanding set­tlement  and growing mechanization, does not occupy and  modify all areas within the United States and its possessions  ... :' During the five years that followed, every time I pre­pared  a proposed decision allowing some use or activity of  the kind generally prohibited, Ed would ask, ""Where in the  act does it say that I can do this?""  The Maturing Forest Service Wilderness Policy  I was assigned to the Washington office in 1965 as the staff  person for wilderness and spent the next four years working  on Forest Service wilderness policy and philosophy. It was an  exciting and rewarding experience. I was gradually and some­times  painfully converted from a development-oriented forest­er  to a dedicated advocate for sound wilderness stewardship.  7  During those years everyone involved at that level came to  the realization that these lands had been set aside for wilder­ness  purposes, not as ""recreation areas:' Reaching this under­standing  was especially difficult for me. I had been managing  the Bridger Wilderness as a recreation area and had been  making ""improvements"" to enhance recreation use. It took  several months before full realization of this idea dawned on  me. At any rate, it became increasingly clear that, while recre­ation  is a legitimate use of wilderness, it is also one of the  greatest potential threats to the wilderness character of these  lands. Management actions to enhance recreation are not  necessarily good for wilderness values.  Dick Costley suggested that one barrier to understanding of  the special nature of these places was that we had grown into  the habit of using the word ""wilderness"" as an adjective  modifying the noun ""area;' i.e. The Bob Marshall Wilderness  Area. This implied that these were somewhat different recrea­tion  areas where people can do wilderness kinds of activities  such as hiking, horse packing, and backpacking. This is a nat­ural  parallel to other special areas such as ""ski area;' ""wild  flower area;' ""geologic area;' etc. Upon Dick's recommenda-  8  tion, the chief and staff agreed that ""wilderness"" should be  used as a noun when referring to National Forest units of the  National Wilderness Preservation System, i.e. the Bob Mar­shall  Wilderness is one of three wildernesses on the Flathead  National Forest. They adopted the idea, but old habits die  hard. Many forest officers continue to resist and still refer to  wilderness areas.  Most of the policy and philosophy developed from 1964  through 1969 has stood the test of time and has changed little  over the years. This philosophy has spread through the Na­tional  Forest System. Forest Service ranks contain many out­standing  people dedicated_ to sound wilderness st~wardship.  Unfortunately, most of these are concentrated in the lower  ranks and there is no career ladder that will allow them to as­pire  to the higher grades. Many of these folks are working in  the national forests because that is where the wildernesses  are, not because they have any particular loyalty to the agen­cy.  In fact, some today see an important part of their job as  protecting the wilderness from bad decisions by the agency as  well as improper use. These lower echelon wilderness folks  include dedicated people like Lisa Therrel, judy Frazier, Bob  Oset, Linda Merigliano, Clem Pope, Patty Stieger, Chris Ryan,  Woody Hasselbarth, and many others. It was people like these  who came through for Chief Max Peterson when he told the  Environmental Protection Agency that the Forest Service  would take the water samples from 490 wilderness lakes us­ing  primitive travel methods rather than let EPA use helicop­ters.  They proved that the Forest Service had the right stuff.  There are also several higher grade staff who have demon­strated  real commitment to wilderness such as Susan Marsh  on the Bridgerffeton, Steve Morton and Liz Close in the  Northern Region, and Margaret Peterson in the Pacific North­west  Region. At the national headquarters, john Twiss and jer­ry  Stokes have a strong commitment to wilderness. If given  the opportunity, john and jerry can lead the Forest Service on  the right path to good wilderness stewardship.  Unfortunately, it is more difficult today to find line officers  who are solidly dedicated to wilderness. Many seem to view  wilderness as a problem rather than a ""white hat"" opportuni­ty.  Some become involved only in a reactive way and make  9  decisions that are politically expedient at the moment rather  than decisions based on what is best for wilderness in the  long run.  One reason for line officer indifference to wilderness  stewardship is that their citizen constituents have not paid  much attention to it. For the past 27 years the bulk of citizen  attention has been focused on building the wilderness system  and the Forest Service has often been left to meet threats to  established wildernesses without much citizen support. It's  hard to stand up and do battle when there is no cheering sec­tion.  That is changing. ""Wilderness Watch"" was born in 1989  and other organizations, both local and national, are begin­ning  to show more interest. I also see other positive signs.  Congress is appropriating more dollars. Line officers are being  trained at Nine Mile Wildland Training Center in Montana.  And there is renewed effort to better coordinate management  of those large wildernesses whose management is fragmented  among several national forests.  Future Agenda for the Vision  Yes-the Forest Service has slipped some during the past  few years in commitment to wilderness stewardship, but it  can, and I believe will, regain its former leadership position.  To make this happen, the chief must give wilderness steward­ship  personal attention. With one in five National Forest  acres designated in the National Wilderness Preservation Sys­tem,  every Forest Service employee must be involved to  some degree in re-establishing that leadership. Everyone must  understand the value and purpose of designated Wildernesses  · and there must be no doubt where the chief stands on the is­sue.  I predict the Forest Service wi II very soon pick up the  wilderness stewardship ball and run with it. The chief will set  the tone and that wonderful Forest Service team will fall in  behind. Top people will be trained in the art of wilderness  stewardship and assigned to lead that effort. The chief wi II go  to Congress, with strong public support, seeking adequate  funding. Congress will respond to this renewed commitment  and necessary funding support will be provided. The Forest  Service Wilderness Stewardship Program will look much  different in the year 2000 than it does today. Here is what I  see:  10  The wilderness resource will have been recognized as the  distinct and valuable resource it is. It will have the same stat­ure  in forest officers' minds as the resources of timber, range,  wildlife, recreation, and water. A Director of Wilderness  Stewardship will have been established at the Washington of­fice  and at each regional office. The Forest Service wilderness  research effort wi II be greatly expanded and that effort wi II be  complemented by accelerated work in the land grant colleges  and universities. The chief and regional foresters will per­sonally  be participating in most national and international  conferences concerning wilderness. There will be a construc­tive  and friendly working relationship between the agency  and those citizen organizations concerned with promoting  good wilderness stewardship.  Well trained professional people will be key to achieving  success in wilderness stewardship. In recognition of this, the  Forest Service will have worked with the civil service folks  and established an employment career series for professional  wilderness stewards. Several colleges and universities will  have established programs leading to degrees in wilderness  stewardship and the Forest Service will be competing with the  other wilderness agencies for the top graduates from these  programs.  Within the wildernesses themse·lves, the present condition  and trend in the quality of the wilderness resource will have  been inventoried and mapped. Monitoring programs will  have been established to measure changes in conditions. Nat­ural  fire will be more nearly playing its natural role in wilder­ness.  The agency will be working with citizens to establish  Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) standards to guide ad­ministrative  actions. Stewardship decisions will reflect the ""na­tional""  interest as opposed to the local or regional interest  whenever there is a conflict. The ""non-degradation"" principle  wi II be a wilderness management fact rather than merely a  goal.  Management activities on the 80 percent of the National  Forest lands not included in the Wilderness System will com­plement  the Wilderness Stewardship effort. An aggressive dis­persed  recreation program will be in place to provide  alternatives for those people who want or need more facilities  11  than are appropriate in wildernesses. The trail system will be  improved, expanded, and/or re-designed to make attractive  and enjoyable trail experiences easily available for hikers,  horseback riders, mountain bikers, and others. The possible  effect on wilderness values will be carefully considered every  time a road is to be constructed or reconstructed near any  wilderness boundary and those impacts will be avoided or  mitigated when possible.  Forest Service administrative organizations will have been  adjusted to better respond to the wilderness stewardship  challenges and to ensure career ladders for wilderness profes­sionals.  I've already mentioned the wilderness stewardship  directors at the national and regional offices. In addition, each  wilderness or group of wildernesses will be administered by a  single line officer who has no responsibilities for management  of lands outside the wilderness. There will be several Wilder­ness  National Forests, i.e. the Frank Church-River of No Re­turn  Wilderness National Forest, the Bob Marshall Wilderness  National Forest, the Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Na­tional  Forest, etc. The balance of the wildernesses will be­come  ranger districts with the district boundary identical to  the wilderness boundary.  The career implications for those new graduates in wilder­ness  stewardship are obvious. They will start out in the  wilderness as a wilderness ranger and if they do well, ad­vance  to district ranger on one of the smaller wilderness dis­tricts.  From there it will be on to a larger district-to deputy  supervisor or wilderness staff positions and on to supervisor  of a wilderness national forest. They can eventually aspire to  be regional foresters and Chief. Wilderness will no longer be  a dead-end career.  12  Wilderness as a Central Vision for the  National Forests  Stewardship of established wildernesses is a real ""white hat""  job. Controversy will continue to swirl around the establish­ment  of new wildernesses, but the overwhelming majority of  Americans will support stewardship decisions that are clearly  aimed at preserving ""an enduring resource of wilderness"" as  the Wilderness Act directs. I don't mean to imply there will  not be any battles-there will be. However, the agency will  not be standing alone. The concept of wilderness is the stuff  that dreams are made of. The very word conjures up visions  of adventure, challenge, and romance, and it is shrouded in  mystery. Wilderness is important for those who regularly visit  it, but it is equally important for many who only dream about  it. Children who pitch a tent to sleep in the back yard get  more out of that experience because they know there are still  places where the bears are not in cages. I know others who  dream and plan for years for a once-in-a-lifetime visit to a  wilderness. They may never get there, but they get much of  pleasure thinking about it.  Ohmer Creek on Mitkof Island, Tongas National Forest, Alaska  13  Even more important are the scientific and educational  values of having large areas where nature is allowed free  reign. Future generations will thank today's wilderness  stewards if they do their job well, and curse them if they fail.  Dedicated and committed wilderness guardians will be ad­mired,  respected, and envied, like the forest rangers of old. It  will be a rewarding job. There is no agency better qualified to  handle stewardship of wildernesses than the fine people in  the United States Forest Service. They will come through and  set the standard for the other agencies. Wilderness is the cen­terpiece  of my vision for the national forests in the 21st centu­ry.  14  Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureships  1977 Senator Frank Church  1978 Roderick Nash  1979 Cecil D.

A Vision for Wilderness in the National Parks,Roger Contor,"Lecture given by Roger Contor. Introduction by John C. Hendee, dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and director of the Wilderness Research Center. The lecture starts by calling for better political representation for the National Parks. The history of the role (or lack therof) that the Parks played in the Wilderness Act is reviewed as is the reason that the Parks manage their lands differently from the Forest Service. The lecturer displays a few slides of Alaskan Wilderness and Idaho superimposed on a map of Alaska to show the extent and porportion of wilderness in that state. The lecture also displays three species (the grizzly bear, the Dall sheep, and the caribou) as exhibits of what the wilderness holds. The lecturer then expresses his opinion that the National Parks have failed to lead the charge in political protection of wilderness. The lecturer proposes that the solution is to: 'Establish wilderness leadership at the top. Appoint leaders who understand wilderness. Educate people that No Trace Wilderness is possible. Document wilderness values with research. Support those who seek excellence in wilderness. Protect the mystery of wilderness. Reopen communication with Congress. Re-establish cooperative relationships with conservation organizations. Restore wilderness naturalness. Re-establish natural fire regimes. Establish trail patterns compatible with wilderness. Protect diversity with appropriate management. Eliminate wilderness structures and non-historic artifacts. Establish a high ethic for legal hunting in the Alaskan park units. Restore the professional spirit of the Park Service.' The lecture closes with a few more points about the benefits of wilderness as a mesuring stick for the how we are affecting the rest of the world and placing the blame soundly on the political leaders once again.

Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureship  A VISION FOR  WILDERNESS IN THE  NATIONAL PARKS  12  Roger Contor  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO WILDERNESS RESEARCH CENTER  December 3, 1992  basis of their contributions to the philosophical and  scientific rationale of wilderness management.  Tonight we continue this tradition as we hear the  second in a mini-series of four lectures designed to present  a vision for wilderness in the four federal agencies  responsible for managing the National Wilderness  Preservation System-the Forest Service, National Park  Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Fish and  Wildlife Service. The agency that manages the most of the  93 million acres in the National Wilderness Preservation  System is the National Park Service, which currently  administers nearly 40 million acres of designated  wilderness. To this end we are honored to present Roger  Contor who, in his 30-year career with the National Park  Service, has helped shape the National Park Service  wilderness program and remains one of the strongest  advocates for wilderness in the national park vision.  Dr. Krumpe is principal scientist for the Wilderness  Research Center and associate professor in the Department  of Resource Recreation and Tourism.  vi  Introduction  John C. Hendee  I'm very pleased to introduce this evening Roger  Cantor, a University of Idaho graduate, retired National  Park Service official, and one of the most active advocates  for wilderness in the national parks. In the course of his 30-  year career, Roger has served in many posts, helping to  shape the Park Service's wilderness programs. He has been  superintendent of Craters of the Moon National Monument,  Rocky Mountain National Park, Olympic National Park, and  was the first superintendent of North Cascades National  Park. At Craters of the Moon he led preparation of the first  National Park Service Wilderness Management Plan.  Roger was regional director for the Alaska Region  during passage and implementation of the Alaska National  Interest Lands (ANILCA), which added over 56 million  acres to the nation's wilderness system. In 1972, he was  secretary general of the Second World Conference on  National Parks.  Now hailing from Ellensburg, Washington, Roger has  remained involved in conservation matters since his  retirement. He served on the National Academy of  Science's Committee on Science in the National Parks, and  has been a member of the Washington State Governor's  Task Force for Wildlife and Recreation Lands Management.  Roger Cantor earned a rare reputation as a practical  resource manager who loves wilderness, appreciates  science, and tells it like it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my long time  colleague and friend, occasional hunting partner, and our  vii  Distinguished Wilderness Resource Lecturer, Mr. Roger  Con tor.  john C. Hendee is dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences, and director of the Wilderness  Research Center.  viii  A VISION FOR  WILDERNESS IN THE  NATIONAL PARKS  Roger Contor  Thank you Dean Hendee. I am pleased to be here,  and feel I am in very distinguished company. As I look at  the list of the previous twelve speakers in this series, I am  especially impressed with Roderick Nash, Ceci I Andrus, jay  Hair, and lan Player. They have all made great  contributions to the wilderness movement.  I have a subtitle for this talk: ""Is anybody awake up  there?"" By that I mean to differentiate between the  professional managers of the National Park System and the  political appointees. Specifically the political leaders are the  Director of the National Park Service, the Assistant  Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of the Interior. I  am not talking against having political leaders  superimposed over career employees of a bureau. Good  political appointees bring fresh insight and energy into an  organization. Your own governor, Cecil Andrus, was a fine  example of a secretary of Interior appointed by President  Carter. It is the poor, unqualified political appointments  which are the problem.  Let's start back in the late 1950s when the Wilderness  1  Act was proposed. The political leaders of the National  Park Service (the Park Service) were asked, ""Do you want  the National Park System included in the Wilderness Act?""  The answer was ""No, we don't need it. We are above that.  The Wilderness Act is for the Forest Service, the Fish and  Wildlife Service, and the BLM-agencies which must  contend with multiple use.""  Underlying that answer was a good measure of sour  grapes-jealousy. The Forest Service had come up with the  idea of wilderness preservation and had presented it to the  American public. The Park Service was left behind in this  new philosophical concept.  The Park Service political leaders had other arguments  against being included in the National Wilderness  Preservation System. They accurately pointed out that the  salient wording of the proposed legislation was essentially  lifted and paraphrased from the 1916 Organic Act creating  the National Park Service. The proposed wilderness act  even directed that wilderness designation in the National  Park System should in no way diminish the integrity of the  parks.  It was also true that the conservation organizations  concentrated their energies on the need for wilderness  preservation in the national forests. They acknowledged  that wilderness designation within the parks would not  require any significant change in traditional park  management.  These discussions continue even today, nearly thirty  years after passage of the Wilderness Act, i.e. ""Why does  the Park Service manage wilderness so differently from the  Forest Service?"" One answer is that its Congressional  mandate is very different. Park Service management is on a  much more inclusive, mother-hen-like scale. It usually  exercises exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. For example  it carries out nearly all law enforcement, conducts all  search and rescue, and manages its fish and wildlife-jobs  the Forest Service usually leaves up to the states and  2  counties. It also has a slightly different attitude than the  Forest Service on appropriate use of helicopters, aircraft,  and chainsaws in wilderness. Perhaps Congress will  someday clarify the differing agency interpretations of the  Wilderness Act.  But let us return to the pre-Wilderness Act posture of  the Park Service. The other part of the equation-the career  Park Service professionals-superintendents, chief rangers,  biologists, park naturalists-felt very differently from the  political leaders. They had just witnessed the great increase  in construction of roads, buildings, and utilities which came  from Mission 66, the ten-year park construction program  which Congress endorsed in 1956. And they had lived  under the dominance of the large concessionaires, who  wielded more power than superintendents or regional  directors to influence Park Service decisions. The career  professionals feared the Wilderness Act was needed to  protect the national parks from the National Park Service.  Remember, this was a time before the National  Environmental Policy Act, a time before agencies were  required to share their plans in advance with the public.  The political leadership made the decision, the contract was  let, and the bulldozers moved. Sometimes the construction  was primarily for the benefit of park concessionaires, who,  coincidentally, had close friendships with the appropriate  congresspersons or senators.  Career Park Service employees had another reason for  welcoming the Wilderness Act. It was they who had chosen  national parks as their lifetime habitat. It was they who had  been touched by unchanged America, and they who saw  wilderness as something of inherently great social value.  They were very glad to see the act pass.  The question becomes obvious: does the indifference of  the Park Service toward wilderness amount to contempt of  Congress? Before we answer that, a few statistics: the  National Park System includes approximately 80 million  acres. Nearly 40 million acres, or 50 percent of its lands,  3  are now designated wilderness. Another eight million acres  have been recommended to Congress for wilderness  designation. It manages more wilderness than any other  agency. The Forest Service has about 34 million acres of  wilderness, the Fish and Wildlife Service about 19 million,  and the BLM less than a million acres (that is where the  greatest urgency for new wilderness exists-in BLM lands. It  will require hard work, but it can be done).  I want to show a few slides of wilderness in the Alaskan  national parks. This is partly because most of you will not  be familiar with that part of the park system wilderness, and  partly because I was Regional Director there. Alaska  contains over 80 percent of all national park wilderness.  warn you however, to go there after you have seen the  wilderness areas in the lower 48. After you experience  Alaskan wilderness, you will be spoiled and all other  wilderness will seem smaller and less remote in  comparison!  The first slide is one we created to tease Cecil Andrus  when he was Secretary of the Interior. It shows Idaho  superimposed on a map of Alaska, demonstrating that its 54  million acres is small when compared with Alaska's 375  million acres. Later it so happened that the national parks  of Alaska also total 54 million acres, exactly equal to Idaho  in size. This helps us understand the scale of the national  parks there.  Next is the Gates of the Arctic, where Bob Marshall, the  Forest Service employee who founded the wilderness  protection concept, spent time in the 1930s. Here he  solidified many of his wilderness values. It is now an eight­million-  acre national park wilderness.  The slides of Wrangell-St. Elias and Glacier Bay  National Parks show the grand dimensions and dynamic  nature of Alaska. The thirteen-million-acre Wrangell-St. Elias  has most of the peaks in North America over 16,000 feet,  and has icefields on which you can walk 200 miles in a  fairly straight line without ever leaving the ice. Its glacier  4  landscape is exactly as much of North America looked  during the Pleistocene.  The lower, recently forested 30 to 40 miles of Glacier  Bay's islands and shorelands were all ice-covered when  john Muir visited the area only a hundred years ago. Global  warming may not be that new.  The photo of a salmon-crowded stream in Katmai  National Park reminds us that the world's greatest  remaining salmon runs sti II hold strong in several of the  parks on the Alaskan peninsula. Man hasn't yet wrecked  these runs with hatcheries and overharvesting, although  many people are working diligently towards that end.  In Alaska, where there are fish, there are grizzlies. All  the national parks of Alaska have grizzly populations,  which together contain a major share of Alaska's 25,000  grizzlies. These bears are the superlative animals of the  wilderness. Their presence makes a wilderness visit richer  and more exciting. I personally would not be much  interested in visiting an Alaskan wilderness which has no  grizzlies.  The Park Service has a good record in preventing  people and bears from hurting each other. Prevention is a  product of intense management in the few developed areas,  aimed at preventing bears from equating humans with a  source of food. Bear management involves some active  behavioral modification of bears which are taught that such  association with humans and human foods is an  undesirable experience. They are pelted with harmless  rubber bullets, stung with chemical irritants, or trapped and  moved to remote areas. And I hope that when we do have  to destroy a male bear in the future, we will preserve its  semen for future genetic needs when and if needed. We  seem to have a healthy population of bears in Alaska, but  in the lower 48 states we may not now even have a  genetically viable population.  The herds of Dall sheep and caribou inAiaska's  5  national park wilderness are what make a quiet wilderness  come alive. The caribou are the final chance for mankind  to correctly manage large, free-ranging, migratory ungulates  in North America. All the  big herds roam more than  one agency's jurisdiction,  challenging federal  agencies, the state, and the  natives to cooperate  intelligently if this  spectacle is to survive. We  have already lost the  migrations of bison, elk,  bighorns, and pronghorn.  t The caribou alone are left  to provide a glimpse of the awesome energy of the great  herds of primitive America.  Now you have seen a bit more of what is at stake. And  the answer is yes, the National Park Service political  leadership has failed its responsibility in wilderness  management. It has also missed a wonderful bureaucratic  opportunity to garner positive public acclaim. (Do you  know the definition of a bureaucrat? A person who cuts red  tape lengthwise.) The Park Service should wake up and  jump on the chance to lead the nation and the world in  wilderness philosophy and management. It has already  done so in other disciplines, such as interpretation and  historic preservation.  Wilderness within a national park should be  championed as the very best of the very best remnants of  America's original landscape. Put another way, when you  are taking care of the very best of anything, you should do  it well, or the owners will make some unpleasant changes.  The spectre of a newly designated agency, such as a  National Wilderness Service which would manage all  wilderness areas, would remove the best incentive for  excellence which now exists among the Park Service,  Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service. It is the  6  competition with each other, the rivalry, which overrides  all other incentives. Put all wilderness under one agency  and that agency is apt to fall asleep on the job.  There is an analogy between national recreation areas  and national parks that applies to wilderness and non­wilderness  portions of national parks. In the 1930s the Park  Service was asked to manage recreation areas, federal lands  which had recreational values but which did not meet the  standards of a national park. The Park Service said no to  that idea also. It felt dual responsibility would reduce the  standards of management to the lower common  denominator. The service was overruled, and the opposite  of what it feared took place. When parks and recreation  areas were managed side by side, the parks loomed more  pure than ever. Both areas elevated to a higher level. I  contend that wilderness within a park makes both parts of  the park more distinctive.  How can the Park Service meet the wilderness  expectations of the American public? By celebrating rather  than merely tolerating wilderness.  My prescription for responsible wilderness management  by the National Park Service calls for it to:  1. Establish wilderness leadership at the top. Develop an  institutional conscience at the highest levels for  management, protection, and enjoyment of wilderness. The  Park Service does not now have a chief and keeper of  wilderness in Washington or any of the regional offices. In  each case wilderness management is a collateral duty for  someone assigned to other functions. In the minds of top  managers then, 39-plus million acres aren't important  enough to keep one person busy full time. This is  ridiculous! Only in the field do we have people devoted  exclusively to wilderness management.  2. Appoint leaders who understand wilderness. We need  top leaders who have walked and sweated and paddled in  wilderness...:.who have measured it in miles, not city blocks,  7  not days, not minutes. We've had only two interior  secretaries who knew wilderness and made major  contributions to its preservation-Stewart Udall and Cecil  Andrus. I have met all the directors of the Park Service who  have served since the early 1940s. I am sorry to say only  one-Gary Everhart-had any real grasp of wilderness.  The canoe Indians of the northeast had a saying:  ""Hidden is .your paddle."" If after a long trip with several  canoes, they didn't want to say goodbye at the last  campfire, they hid their friend's paddle so he couldn't  leave-a tribute to friendship and a love of the wild lands.  When did we last have a director whose paddle you would  want to hide?  3. Educate people that No Trace Wilderness is possible.  Develop the best possible public education program on the  theme of ""No Trace Wilderness Use IS Possible."" From  education comes understanding, from understanding comes  appreciation, from appreciation comes protection of the  resource. During James Watt's administration, it was an  aroused public, not the Park Service, Department of  Interior, or federal government that kept him from carrying  out his wishes.  4. Document Wilderness Values with Research.  Aggressively pursue every type of research possible­biological,  sociological, and psychological-which nails  down the quantifiable values of wilderness to humankind. If  we can't back up with facts our idealistic rhetoric on gene  pools, natural laboratories, personal enrichment, and so  forth, we will get shot out of the saddle by an increasingly  hungry and desperate nation of people who live for now,  who feel posterity has done nothing for them, who have  never met wilderness.  5. Support those who seek excellence in wilderness  management. Revitalize the morale of Park Service  backcountry and wilderness personnel in their legitimate  quest for excellence. Reward those who carry the  questioning spirit, display the energy to tackle a job and  8  finish it, and show the courage to take an unpopular stand.  There is high enthusiasm among personnel assigned to  wilderness management (as there should be!), but they are  adrift without backing from the top. Unfortunately we have  already lost too many good people because of antagonistic  political leadership.  6. Protect the mystery of wilderness. Maintain the  opportunity for personal discovery by the wilderness user.  Nameless features should remain nameless. An unnamed  lake seems much wilder than just another Lake Alice. The  fisherman should work to find out where the fish are, not  be told by a streamside video. Photographers should  discover for themselves when and where it is best to shoot  a sunset, or view a bull elk in its bugling activity. People  should be able to key out some of the flowers, mushrooms,  and new birds. We must not remove all the unknowns.  Albert Einstein said:  The most beautiful experience we can have is  the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion  which stands at the cradle of true art and true  science. Whoever does not know it and can  no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as  good as dead, his eyes are dimmed. (""What I  Believe,"" The World as I See It, New York:  New York Philosophical Library, 1934)  7. Reopen communication with Congress. Re-establish a  professional legislative liaison with Congress. For the past  12 years, our legislative staff in Washington have been  under a gag order preventing open communication with  congressional staffs. A flow of information is needed for  both the Park Service and Congress to do a better job. I  worked nearly four years in Washington on the ANILCA  legislation when Park Service employees were encouraged  to communicate with congressional staffers. Everyone,  especially the public, profited from that relationship.  Do you know why Mo Udall, Chair of the House  Interior Committee, never scheduled a Friday meeting or  9  floor vote on conservation issues? Because the eastern  congressmen went home for the weekend, and you don't  usually pass conservation issues in a room full of western  congressmen. I learned that late in my career when I went  to Washington to work on the Alaskan D-2 issue. It made  me realize how politically naive many Park Service field  managers really are.  The new wilderness management bills introduced by  Congressman Bruce Vento (Chair of Parks and Public Lands  Subcommittee) for better Park Service, Forest Service, and  Fish and Wildlife Service wilderness management is a good  legislative proposal, but it contains errors which would  have been caught by experienced agency staffers. While the  Vento bill is headed in the right direction, it shouldn't even  be necessary. Proper wilderness management by the Park  Service would have avoided the need. Vento is fed up with  indifference from the wilderness agencies. Congressional  interaction with the Park Service should be something  besides crisis management and disaster rei ief.  Another example of a legislative goof is the mistaken  entry in ANILCA (SECION 111 OA) which leaves every  square inch of federal land in Alaska open to snowmobiles,  motorboats, and airplanes. This includes the older parks  created early in this century. There is now no wilderness in  Alaska legally protected from the roar of motors. Let us  hope the new administration will make the necessary  corrections. The Reagan folks delighted in letting the error  stand.  8. Re-establish cooperative relationships with  conservation organizations. It is wonderful to see that  conservation group numbers have doubled during the  1980s. But""the conservationists need to work more  effectively with the agencies rather than categorically  painting them as the ""bad guys."" These organizations also  need to subdue the petty competitiveness between one  another and cooperate more effectively. Even fifteen million  conservationists can't compete with 200 million people  worried about jobs. Wilderness units will need all the help  10  available if they are to survive the next century.  9. Restore wilderness naturalness. Return altered  ecosystems to their natural conditions: exotic plants and  animals should be eliminated where feasible. Extirpated  plants and animals should be re-established. If fish exist in  wilderness lakes only because of artificial stocking, they  should be removed. This is old and standard park policy,  but still often politically circumvented.  10. Re-establish natural fire regimes. Get back on the  track of natural fire management. We have invested too  much in the process to let the Yellowstone event get us  down. It is key and integral to all other aspects of natural  resource management. I was the first superintendent of a  forested national park to allow large natural fires to run  their course in North Cascades (in 1970). It is still the  professionally correct action when conditions permit.  One mistake that Yellowstone managers seem to have  made was believing their prescriptions and computers, and  ignoring their intuitive judgement. But their biggest error  was in bragging-early in the fire's progress-just how  wonderful and proper all this was. Had they instead agreed  to a need for fighting the fires earlier, the results of the fires  would have been the same, and the public would have  been satisfied. It was a biological success, but a political  disaster, one which has set us back 10 to 20 years in public  understanding.  11. Establish trail patterns compatible with wilderness.  Adopt wilderness trail plans which fit today's values and  are driven by ecological sensitivity as well as human  satisfaction. It should close and remove trails which were  built mainly to keep CCC crews busy, but which  inadvertently violate sensitive biotic areas such as calving  and fawning grounds, rookeries, and unique plant  communties.  12. Protect diversity with appropriate management. Avoid  the path to mediocrity which sometimes follows a mindless  11  drive for standardization and consistency in wilderness  management from park to park and between agencies.  Parks are too different from each other to fit standardized  methods. Management should aim for non-degradation of  the unique resource rather than be driven by agency  mindset. There is strength and creativity in being  ""different."" You have to be sharper, more alert, with a  competitive urgency. I would rather see the Forest Service  and Park Service try to outdo each other than see them  relax into complacency because they agree on policies.  13. Eliminate wilderness structures and non-historic  artifacts. Remove all or nearly all backcountry memorials­structures  such as shelters, look-outs, corrals, fences, and  cabins which were mistakenly built in the first place. And if  you don't think they are memorials, just try to remove one  sometime. Structure supporters pour out of the woodwork.  These are usually folks who helped build them or had a  pleasant experience of some sort with them earlier in their  lives. Like the beaver, people seem compelled to build and  repair things. But beavers have a purpose, and they  produce natural and beautiful features.  We need to control the agency's most ambitious  historians who, overflowing with the power of the Historic  Preservation Act, try to preserve every manmade structural  intrusion over SO years old in the backcountry of the large  natural areas. This is as illogical as closing the historical  jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. to public entry to  protect the natural frogs and turtles. The purpose of the area  and the significance of its features should control the  action. If a cabin was built in a natural meadow for reasons  having little to do with the important history of the region,  then the cabin should be removed and the meadow  returned to a natural state.  14. Establish a high ethic for legal hunting in the Alaskan  park units. Become a leader in upgrading the American  sport hunting ethic in the national preserves of Alaska.  These units represent 20 million acres of possibly the  grandest wildlife habitat in North America. It would be  12  interesting to steer modern hunters toward the relationship  with animals held by native Alaskans. They do not outwit  or conquor the quarry. Instead, the animal ""gives"" itself to  the hunter. The hunter thanks it and treats it with respect.  The Park Service should also recognize the efforts of the  Boone and Crockett Club in establishing the Mt. McKinley,  Theodore Roosevelt, and Olympic National Parks. Hunting  is slowly fading from the American scene, but hunters are  an important part of our history and can still be powerful  allies in conservation battles.  15. Restore the professional spirit of the Park Service.  Regain its spirit, strength, and internal pride as a  professional organization. I need not dwell on the rash of  media articles which spell out the deterioration of the  National Park System and Service in the last 12 years. Their  damage has been serious.  This is my prescription. To cap it off, here are a few  additional reasons why our nation should expect the Park  Service to advocate and champion wilderness:  In 1972 the International Union for the Conservation of  Nature proposed that the best single measure of the quality  of human I ife is diversity. The idea caught on and is now  widely accepted. The presence of great wilderness adds  significantly to the diversity which makes America a great  land. It adds to our quality of life, and to our national self­esteem  through actual or vicarious experiences. Ask any  Europeans you meet in your travels if they would like to  have wilderness in their country. Their answer is  predictable, of course. But for them it is too late.  We should also save large wilderness areas in national  parks because they are the least altered lands in our nation.  They are the best comparative yardsticks for scientists to  measure what modern society has done to the rest of the  world. We need national park wilderness to force future  presidents and international leaders to realize that a world  run by a business school mentality-use it up, cut it down,  13  dig it out-is a world that cannot endure.  Albert Schweitzer lamented that ""Man has lost the  power to foretell or forestall, and wi II end by destroying the  earth."" He hoped and we hope that he was wrong. But if  he was right, let us not miss any opportunities. Let us fight  to hang on to our wilderness for as many generations as  possible. I hope we never fully know why wild country and  wildlife can be so seductive-can surprise us with such total  personal satisfaction at times. We've all had those special  moments in nature when everyone stops talking­experiences  which have made us better people.  A wonderful new quote I found is by Lawrence  Millman in his recent book Last Places:  ... as the bright, lustrous evening wore on, I  began to shake off my irritation. A trail of  opaline clouds crowded the horizon ... A  couple of .. .icebergs rested in the fjord, and  the fjord itself had turned a rich  Mediterranean blue. Once when /looked up,  I happened to see a sea eagle poised on  magisterial wings above the summit of the  mountain behind my tent. It was a scene of  peerless tranquility, tossed out in Nature's  devil-may-care way, which says: just open  your eyes my friend, and I'll astonish you  every minute of your life (emphasis added).  We simply must demand that future interior secretaries  and Park Service directors have their eyes open to the  priceless wilderness systems they hold in their hands. The  National Park System has a large and superb wilderness  resource which has the power to change people and  history. The National Park Service has outstanding, highly  dedicated field personnel. The American pub I ic and  Congress are supportive of wilderness.  The problem lies in our appointed political leaders.  While we now exhaustively and unmercifully probe the  14  personal history of everyone running for elected positions,  the appointed cabinet officers and bureau chiefs come to  the public as unknown surprises. Another james Watt could  be made Director of the National Park Service without our  knowing much about it. We all must become highly  involved with such appointments and make it clear to new  presidents and new secretaries that we demand the very  best people for leadership of conservation agencies. If  America demands leaders who know and value wilderness­who  are willing to fight for it-then this will be a richer  nation, and we will have secretaries and directors worthy  enough to have their canoe paddles hidden.  15  Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureships  1977 Senator Frank Church Wilderness in a Balanced land­Use  Framework  1978 Roderick Nash Wilderness Management: A  Contradiction in Terms?  1979 Cecil D.

A Vision for Wilderness in the National Wildlife Refuge System,Bill Reffalt,"Lecture given by Bill Reffalt. Opening Remarks by Edwin E. Krumpe principal scientist for the Wilderness Research Center and professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introuction by John C. Hendee dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences and director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lectre opens with a definition of wilderness and what that means for National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). An introduction is given for the NRWS and how it's purpose is to protect the fish and wildlife, not it's reputation among humans. Refuges span across the United States and it's territories, often focusing on endangered or threatened species. A color slideshow was then presented by the lecturer. The slideshow begins with Alaska, portraying the caribou as a token species that uses the wilderness. In the Pacific Northwest wilderness can be found along the coastline. In the Southwest many desert biomes have been preserved as wilderness. The Midwest and Lake States are home to natural prairies and marshlands. The Northeast holds a 3,000 acre forest swamp. The Southeast has their unique swampland, the Everglades. The lecture then discusses how the Wilderness Act was applied to those refuges, mostly poorly. The lecture then details how that poor enaction of the legeslation is being changed. Unique problems associated with different types of wilderness are described, including Island Wilderness and U.S. Military activity in wilderness. The lecture then details a future plan to incorporate the NWRS with the Wilderness Act. The current paradigm that wildlife managers are operating under is described and a call is made to shift that paradigm. The new model is described as a holistic management program. The proposal is made that wilderness itself is a tool for managers to use, a baseline resource. A list of opportunities that wilderess gives to managers of refuge systems is given. The lecture closes with a Walt Whitman quote. A bibliography is included. A list of past lecturers and the titles of their lectures are listed.",1994-03-03,,lectures; habitat; wildlife refuges; wilderness areas; land management; wilderness;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl13,application/pdf,text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Krumpe  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the  thirteenth in the annual series of Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureships sponsored by the University of  Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The center's mission is  to promote research and educational activities to further our  understanding of wilderness and natural ecosystems and  humankind's relationships to them. Our goal is to gain  knowledge that can be applied to better manage designated  wilderness so that the public can enjoy sustained use and  benefits from our wilderness resources. Since its inception  in 1972, the center has supported and sponsored research  projects in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest, with more than  30 studies completed in the last two decades.  The center also co-sponsors four university courses,  giving students the opportunity to study wilderness  principles and practices, and provides regular internships  for students to gain first-hand experience in wilderness  management and research. At the national level, the center  and its associated staff have sponsored a national  conference on wilderness management, led two national  wilderness task forces, and participated in many workshops,  symposia, and national research conferences.  But of our long standing educational traditions, the one  in which we take most pride is the annual Wilderness  Resource Distinguished Lectureship. In what has become a  fine academic tradition, the Wilderness Research Center has  sponsored the lecture series to encourage constructive  dialogue and to broaden our understanding of the  management and meaning of wilderness resources.  iii  Speakers of national prominence have been invited on  the basis of their philosophical and scientific contributions  to wilderness management.  Tonight we continue this tradition with the third in a  mini-series of four lectures presenting visions for wilderness  in the four federal agencies responsible for managing the  National Wilderness Preservation System - the Forest  Service, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service,  and the Bureau of Land Management. The National  Wildlife Refuge System, managed by the Fish and Wildlife  Service, contains 20,676,341 acres of designated­wilderness.  To this end we are honored to present Bill  Reffalt who has made substantial contributions to the  wilderness movement in his 20-year career with the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service and eight years with the  Wilderness Society. He has dedicated his life to enhancing  wilderness management, especially in the National Wildlife  Refuge System.  Dr. Krumpe is principal scientist for the Wilderness  Research Center and professor in the Department of  Resource Recreation and Tourism.  lV  ·. . . .. . .. ·- ...;; J~~?!J~~!i:j.~:::;•··.  Introduction  John C. Hendee  I'm very pleased to introduce Mr. Bill Reffalt, the  thirteenth speaker in the Distinguished Wilderness Resource  Lectureship series. Throughout his career Bill Reffalt has  been an effective leader advocating wilderness in our  nation's Fish and Wildlife Refuge System. Now a freelance  consultant on fish and wildlife policy working for the  Wilderness Society, other environmental organizations, and  federal agencies, Reffalt earned his credibility during a  twenty-year career in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and  eight years with the Wilderness Society. A regular teacher  at the National Wildlife Refuge System's management  academy, he is presently writing a book on the history of  the refuge system.  Bill earned a bachelor's degree in wildlife  management, with honors, from Colorado State University  in 1963. Following steady career progress from field  positions to national leadership, Reffalt spent almost seven  years as special assistant to the director and chief of the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Office of Alaska Refuge  Planning. At the Alaska office he led field efforts to  develop new and expanded refuges, parks, and wild and  scenic rivers in Alaska, and testified before Congressional  committees. These efforts culminated in the 1980  legislation that added an unprecedented 54 million acres to  the refuge system, plus almost 50 million acres to the  National Park System, Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and  to wilderness in the National Forests.  For the Wilderness Society in Washington, D.C. from  1984-1991 Reffalt led efforts to support Fish and Wildlife  vi  Service refuge system programs and, with his help, Fish and  Wildlife Service land acquisition funding increased from  about $20 million in the early 1980s to around $97 million  in the 1990s. He also spearheaded introduction of the  Wildlife Refuge System Management and Policy Bill (not  yet passed) that will further enhance refuge programs in the  future. That enhancement includes a vision for wilderness  in the Fish and Wildlife Service refuges throughout the  United States.  Bill Reffalt knows resource management and  environmentalism. He's contributed to both. Earlier today  he shared his experiences with our students, and they  deeply appreciated learning first-hand from someone who  has spent so much time in successful efforts to advance  conservation.  Ladies and gentlemen please welcome our 1994  Distinguished Wilderness Resource Lecturer, Mr. Bill  Reffalt, who will present ""A Vision for Wilderness in the  National Wildlife Refuge System.""  john C. Hendee is dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences, and director of the University of Idaho  Wilderness Research Center.  vii  A VISION FOR  WILDERNESS IN THE  NATIONAL WILDLIFE  REFUGE SYSTEM  Bill Reffalt  Thank you Dean Hendee. I feel privileged to be here,  humbled by the excellent reputations of previous lecturers  in this series, and honored by your kind words. I am  further motivated by the many students and friends here  tonight representing today's and tomorrow's stewards of  America's wilderness legacy.  ""Wilderness is the province, the habitat of wild  creatures just as civi I ization is man's habitat. ""1 When  Roderick Nash made that statement at the 1969 biennial  wilderness conference, he spoke not merely his opinion,  but was presenting the results of his research on the  etymology of the word ""wilderness."" Nash found that  ""Wildeor,"" a term used in an 8th Century epic entitled  Beowulf, had evolved from Teutonic, Norse and Old  English terms that, put simply, meant uncontrolled or wild  beasts found in forested swamps. Add ""ness,"" meaning ""the  quality of"" and the result is literally ""the quality of being  the place of wild beasts."" Placing an official Wilderness  designation on a National Wildlife Refuge then, pays it the  double honor of recognizing it among the finest  representatives of untrammeled ecosystems and wildlife  habitats in our nation.  The National Wildlife Refuge System  Presently, our National Wildlife Refuge System (refuge  system or NWRS) contains 20,676,341 acres of federally  designated wilderness. Tonight I would like to introduce  you to some of those places and the wildlife that rely upon  this habitat for their existence. Ours, of necessity, will be a  vicarious venture, but I both invite and urge you to seek  out these refuge areas, and others in the refuge system, as  places providing excellent opportunities to meet native  wildlife in their islands of remaining habitat.  Before we begin that brief visual excursion, I would  like to introduce the refuge system itself: nearly 500  named units cover 91.5 million acres, with one or more  refuges located in each of our 50 states plus six U.S.  territorial areas. The NWRS was begun 91 years ago with  Pelican Island in Florida reserved for the protection of the  then-threatened brown pelicans, herons and other native  birds. The NWRS is hardly known by average Americans.  However, this is not true if you are an average Alaskan  because refuges comprise about 20 percent of that state's  land area (over 76 million acres of refuges). Here Congress  chose to debate, in a lengthy and unusually public manner,  the size, nature, and location of those refuges, along with  44 million acres of new national parks and over 56 million  acres of National Wilderness Preservation System lands.2  Permit me to leave the refuges of ""the Great Land"" for  now, while we scan some of the other 476 refuges in the  system. Some people have suggested that the refuge  system is not a system in any cohesive sense, while others  call it a ""stealth wildlife conservation system."" As we will  soon see, the NWRS deserves more respect than that, but  ultimately it is slightly less important what mankind thinks  of it than how the system performs for the fish and wildlife  that rely upon it for existence.  2  A Haven for Birds and Mammals  Of all America's wildlife species, the NWRS is  associated most closely with migratory birds, both in its  origins and subsequent evolution, and wetland-related  species have been a particular focus. Nearly every  migratory bird species in North America makes use of one  or more units of the NWRS. Some species, subspecies, and  populations rely exclusively on refuge habitats during  critical parts of their annual cycle.  To phalanxes of migrating birds, the refuge system in  the conterminous 48 states appears like chains of sparkling  oases draped across the biological sahara of agricultural  America. That pattern, made increasingly weblike from the  sheer number of refuges, remains based on the needs to: a)  provide bird nesting areas in the north, b) wintering areas  in the south, and c) migration hostels and energy supply  depots at strategic spots in between. At least six  international treaties commit our nation to a continuing  priority effort on behalf of these feathered legions.  Early in this century, after Americans had witnessed  the spectacular 19th Century demise of such noteworthy  creatures as the great auk, American bison, Carolina  parakeet and passenger pigeon, concern for game animals  resulted in refuges whose purpose was to provide for  individual species and their associated ecological  communities. There are refuges for bison in Montana,  Nebraska, and Oklahoma; elk in Montana and Wyoming;  antelope in Oregon and Nevada; Kodiak bears and moose  in Alaska; and desert bighorn in Nevada, Arizona, and New  Mexico. Most of these units exceed one-half million acres  in size and contain most of the basic wildlife community  associations of the animals' original ecosystems.  Refuges that harbor marine species, insular endemics,  and maritime ecotypes have been part of the NWRS since  its early years. The NWRS contains a large number of  islands and islets, ranging from the backyard-sized 0.6-acre  Mille Lacs National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Minnesota to  3  the mega-reserve-sized 1,815,000-acre Kodiak Island  portion of the Kodiak NWR and the nearly 5,000,000-acre  Alaska Mariti me NWR with its 3,000-pl us above-water  projections which include many large islands. The  northwest Hawaiian Archipelago, strewn over a thousand  miles of the Pacific Ocean, was one of more than 53  refuges designated by Theodore Roosevelt during his two­term  presidency. Natural rocks along all of America's  coastlines combine to represent important portions of the  nesting areas for North America's marine species, coastal  colony nesting birds, shorebirds, and marine mammal  haulout areas.  In recent decades, land acquisitions for refuges have  once again shown an emphasis on endangered and  threatened species. Many refuges provide the last  remnants of habitats for creatures squeezed against the  border of that ultimate abyss, extinction. Thus, the refuge  system has come full circle in its original emphasis in less  than one hundred years. We all know that the causes of  the current ecological dilemma and loss of biodiversity are  complex, frequently involving fragmentation, degradation,  and sheer loss of habitats. This makes recovery a  problematic and sometimes expensive venture.  Turning the tide of losses this time will take illl of our  federal and state conservation land systems and a concerted  effort by all interested Americans. Our politicians must be  convinced to do what is right for the environment in the  long-run as demonstrated in current efforts to pass organic  legislation for the refuge system and to reauthorize the  Endangered Species Act.  4  A Snapshot View of Wilderness in the Refuge  System*  Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing  else to gaze on ... ?  Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream  streaking through it,  Searched the Vastness for a something you have losH  Have you strung your soul to silence? Then for God's sake  go and do it;  Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost. 3  Alaska- The Brooks Range, where it arches against the  Arctic Ocean in the northeast corner of Alaska, is a special  place for several reasons. Here, for tens of millennia there  has been an annual gathering of spectacular proportions  and biological significance on what is known as the Arctic  Coastal Plain. Caribou, travelling a thousand miles or more  across snowbound tundra, and sometimes raging rivers,  (*A full color slide show highlighted this portion of Bill Reffa/t's presentation).  5  make their way each Apri I from wintering grounds north of  the Yukon River in Canada crossing into the United States'  northernmost designated wilderness, the treeless plain of the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But, the caribou soon pass  beyond the wilderness into a portion of the refuge where that  designation has been locked in legislative debate because of  hydrocarbons that may exist beneath its surface. Here, in the  remarkably brief span of about 10 days as many as 100,000  caribou congregate to refresh their population for another year  before they are driven by the onslaught of colossal hordes of  biting insects to seek the on-shore breezes and insect-free  gravel bars along the coastline. Areas that may be unused by  the herd in one year due to snow conditions, predation,  insects, or other causes often become crucial in subsequent  years to successful calving and survival, or for the essential  insect relief sought during herd aggregation. Big as it is, the  Arctic NWR is fully uti I ized by its ""Wi ldeor"" and its spaces  are essential to their long term success.  Here, the United States has committed 19 million acres  to refuge status with a boundary drawn to include as much of  the ecosystem of the Porcupine caribou herd as the political  compromises in that 1980 legislation permitted. Here, too,  is the largest designated wilderness in the refuge system -  eight million acres stretching from the Arctic Ocean across the  glaciers and peaks of the Brooks Range and down the upper  reaches of southward coursing rivers to the taiga. A full range  of arctic ecological communities are found in this wilderness  and some of the most spectacular scenery in the NWRS.  About 25 percent of the acreage in the 16 National  Wildlife Refuges in Alaska is designated-wilderness. Only  the briefest introduction to them is possible at this time so I  have chosen to show the types of areas comprising this  wilderness and some representative wildlife one might expect  to find there. Solar basin refuges like Selawik, Koyukuk, and  lnnoko contain watery wildernesses where the rivers hold free  rein and fresh water lakes teem in the summer and early fall  with wetland dependent birds and mammals.  6  ,  The Alaska Maritime NWR presents a vast assemblage of  coastal islands, islets, rocks, reefs, spires, beaches, and  headlands from near Point Barrow at the top of the state to  Attu Island at the end of the Aleutian chain and then across  the broad Pacific coast sweep of the state to the rain forests  of southeast Alaska. Supplying a wide variety of diverse  habitats, often shrouded in mists, this refuge shelters some of  the most significant concentrations of seabirds in the world.  Over 20,000,000 pairs of thirty bird species (80 percent of the  marine birds nesting in Alaska) including kittiwakes, murres,  murrelets, northern fulmars, puffins, storm petrels, and many  others use the refuge for nesting and brooding while feeding  in the adjacent waters. Units of the Alaska Maritime Refuge  also provide haulouts for important portions of the states'  marine mammals. About 2.7 million acres of the refuge have  received wilderness designation.  The Pacific Northwest- Skipping southward along the  coastline we find similar, but less extensive refuge rocks,  islets, and islands along the coasts of Washington and Oregon  and the famous Farallon Islands of California. Most of these  were made refuges in the early 1900s; nearly all are  designated-wildernesses.  The Southwest- Crossing eastward to the lower reaches  of the Colorado River, we find one of the recently designated  refuge wilderness areas, the Havasu NWR. Here the desert  meets and gives way to a major water course creating a  riparian habitat enormously important to a diversity of fish  and wildlife species. Moving eastward again onto famously  arid reaches of the northern Sonoran desert we encounter  another 1990 addition to the National Wilderness  Preservation System, and one of the most pristine examples  of this desert biome left in America. Cabeza Prieta is home  to a unique complex of wildlife and plants deserving of man's  most thoughtful stewardship. In New Mexico, where the arid  Pecos drainage is pinched between the Rockies and the Llano  Estacada, the Salt Lake Wilderness located within the Bitter  Lake NWR encompasses both the desert and unique wetland  habitats. It plays host not only to geese and cranes, but also  to relict and endangered fish fauna.  7  The Midwest and Lake States- In Oklahoma, rocky  knobs rise out of restored native prairie, once again providing  a home to bison, elk, bobcats, and the spirits of native  Indians. On the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the Seney  Wilderness encompasses northern woods silently rising from  soggy marshlands which often ring with spine tingling cries  from the loons and the rattling purrs of sandhill cranes.  The Northeast- The Great Swamp NWR in New Jersey  is actually a 3,000-acre forested swamp situated an hour from  downtown New York City. The Congressional colloquies  while deciding to designate this area, demonstrated a belief  that upland reserve areas can become island-like in character  when the surrounding landscape is developed beyond a  critical point.  The Southeast- In Southern Georgia, the Okefenokee  NWR is ""knee-deep in alligators"" and studded with great  cypress trees. This rich watery world is enveloped in the  Okefenokee Wilderness. Continuing south to the subtropical  Florida mangrove islands we come to Pelican Island where  the refuge system started, and move beyond to the lower  Florida Keys. Here the challenge of protecting diversity and  the entire Florida Bay are intertwined with the fight to save  the Everglades and the battle to maintain the endangered Key  Deer (the ""toy deer""). These are beautiful, productive, and  deserving refuge wilderness units, but they offer severe tests  for no-impact concepts as their accessibility by motorized  craft is practically unlimitable.  Applying the Wilderness Act on the Refuge  System  As early as the 1920s, refuge system administrators  participated peripherally with the Ecological Society of  America and others in discussions and efforts to locate and  describe the natural communities and protected areas in  America.4 The influences of these interactions on the  selection of refuge areas seem confined to the western ""game  ranges"" and some Alaska big game areas. As late as 1963,  8  leadership in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which  administers the refuge system, believed that the then­common  100,000-acre qualifying yardstick would limit  wilderness designation to only a handful of refuge areas.  Only Okefenokee NWR, the large western refuge units, and  the Alaska refuges were likely wilderness candidates in the  view of the agency's director.5 To FWS leaders, wilderness  designation would mean little change in the management of  those areas and would provide a layer of needed  Congressional protection.  After passage of the Wilderness Act, FWS leaders  acknowledged the 5,000-acre minimum and the special  inclusion of . refuge islands, but several uncertainties  remained for them.6 It is apparent they saw benefits in the  statutory protection and the opportunity to withdraw some  refuges from the mineral laws thereby benefitting sensitive  refuge habitats. On the other hand, they thought some  inconsistencies existed in the ""Act"" and found guidance on  refuge wilderness management to be sparse at best.  Nonetheless, FWS selected 82 roadless areas in 67 refuges  (including 48 islands or island groups) for initial study and  proceeded to conduct the field studies arid public hearings.  At that stage knowledge, experience, and expertise related to  the wilderness concept became vested in a small cadre of  refuge management personnel. Perennially short of staff,  refuge offices in Washington and the regions found it  convenient to have a single staff specialist coordinate the  work effort, including the issuance of written guidelines,  interpreting the law, and providing guidance about wilderness  management. As the studies proceeded, this cadre of  personnel increased only slightly. The more difficult and  larger study areas were reviewed by wilderness study teams,  while on the less controversial or smaller units, individual  refuge managers, like myself, completed the field reviews,  wrote the required reports, and arranged public meetings and  hearings with support from the regional coordinator.  Given this approach, the Wilderness Act never became  widely understood on refuges. It was a priority for most FWS  leaders only because of the required deadlines. When the  9  studies were completed and resulting recommendations  forwarded to Congress, the ""wilderness"" matter was  considered ended. From that point forward the only FWS  personnel involved in wilderness issues were the individual  refuge managers and staff on refuges with subsequently  designated wilderness areas and a single Washington staff  person assigned the task of handling any wilderness questions  and reports, among their other duties. Thus, an agency with  considerable and growing wilderness responsibilities had  established almost no institutional knowledge and experience  with the Wilderness Act or its required management  concepts, and virtually no agency ethos for refuge managers  to utilize in their wilderness interactions.  The apparent weaknesses arising from these historical  circumstances have been accentuated by lack of funding for  refuge wilderness matters. The FWS has never requested  specific funds or manpower in the NWRS budget to  accomplish work associated with wilderness designation and  has yet to receive an appropriation for wilderness boundary  surveys, research, monitoring, management, or enforcement.  This has resulted in an indelible message to managers  throughout the refuge system: wilderness gets no priority in  refuges.  Today, some regions of the FWS are filling these voids  by developing constructive guidance manuals, wilderness  planning concepts, basic wilderness indoctrination and  training, and advanced training for new managers on refuges  containing designated wilderness. These needs grow, as  occurred in 1990, when Congress takes action on some of the  long pending refuge proposals. Currently 22 areas,  comprising over 2 million acres, spread throughout 15 states,  remain pending in Congress. In addition nearly 50,000,000  acres of potential recommendations are still pending in  Alaska.  10  The Maturing NWRS Wilderness Policy  Refuge wildernesses are a mecca for those seeking a  special wild experience. Active management is required to  ensure that people, in their enthusiasm, do not overuse and  modify the wilderness features. Because NWRS wilderness  overlays areas focused on restoration or maintenance of  superior wildlife conditions, public access may necessarily  be denied visitors at certain times and places. For example,  visitation to crowded seabird nesting colonies may have to be  accomplished from a distance to avoid nestling exposure to  predation when the startled parents flee the nests in distress.  In some particularly sensitive wildlife situations, only  vicarious visitation through off-site educational programs may  be appropriate. Some visitors may need to be provided  special pre-visit educational materials to prepare for  unpredictable reactions to humans from animals such as  grizzly bears. Such challenges require creative solutions by  refuge staff whose responsibilities include both safeguarding  and sharing vital components of our nation's natural heritage.  As a rule, these highly motivated professionals are doing a  commendable job given the absence of agency support and  minimum level of training available to them.  An excellent compendium of wilderness management  challenges, values, perspectives, needs, and approaches  resulted from a conference in Athens, Georgia with the papers  published as a Forest Service General Technical Report. 7  Most refuge wilderness management challenges differ from  those described in this report only by degree, physical site  characteristics, and the primary purposes of the underlying  reserve. I recommend the essays in that report to all  wilderness managers and will not offer a redundant list of  problems for refuge areas.  Unique NWR Wilderness Sites  The refuge system contains unique wilderness units that  offer uncommon challenges and these, I feel, should be  described to you.  11  Island Wilderness:  Forty-one units of NWRS wilderness are comprised  entirely of islands. These may include chains of hundreds or  even thousands of above-water natural features, some vast  islands, or a single islet of a few acres. The Wilderness Act  directed ""every roadless island"" within the refuge system,  regardless of size, be studied, and those qualifying be  recommended for wilderness designation. In addition,  several underwater portions of refuge areas in Alaska were  given wilderness designation and are currently America's only  marine wildernesses.  These wilderness units offer a number of difficulties for  managers attempting to maintain both the wilderness  character and wildlife capabilities of the areas. Islands  present a special stewardship challenge to the poorly trained  and under-equipped refuge staffs. Unit size, relative  isolation, physical characteristics, and the wildlife species  involved, each affect the nature and intensity of impacts  from the several sources.8 Oil spills and cleanup operations  off the Northwest coast and in Alaska had severe effects on  the animal denizens and their habitats in the Washington  Islands Wilderness and the Wilderness Study Areas of the  Alaska Maritime NWR. In the Gulf of Mexico the press of  recreational boaters, commercial fishing fleets, overflights, and  adventure seekers threaten Breton Island Wilderness and the  largest nesting tern colony in North America. In and adjacent  to the Florida Keys Wilderness, where endangered butterflies,  Key deer, a tree cactus, and other species precariously hang  on in refuge habitats despite relentless community  development and rapidly expanding water-oriented recreation,  the presence of illegal activities, such as drug smuggling,  sometimes involving refuge wilderness islands, offers unique  and dangerous difficulties. Add to these issues the advancing  demise of Florida Bay (located immediately adjacent to the  wilderness islands) due to the complex problems of the  Everglades ecosystem and one finds cause for a short-handed  refuge staff to appear stretched beyond reasonable limits of  tolerance.  12  In every island wilderness, difficulties arise from  remoteness to the administering refuge staff and facilities, and  need for special marine/aquatic (or aircraft) equipment to  ensure minimum impacts from island access. The need to  monitor a minimum set of wilderness and wildlife parameters  on island chains strewn over thousands of square miles of  ocean, in areas famous for world class severe weather  systems, outstrip the capabilities, by distances best measured  in light-years. Boundary and jurisdictional issues often require  special arrangements with state agencies to resolve law  enforcement issues and permit maintenance of vital protective  buffers for islets hosting colony nesting birds or endangered  species. There is an urgent need for specially developed  pub I ic education materials and programs, but current  resources seldom permit refuge staff to get beyond crisis  management.  In addition to the list of human-induced challenges,  island wilderness areas have also experienced phenomena  arising from larger, often ""natural"" issues. TheEl Nino current  has caused unusual movements in the fish used as food by  island nesting marine birds. This has resulted in reproductive  failures, abandoned colonies, and even adult mortality.  Given the low breeding rates of marine birds and mammals,  such disturbances may require decades for recovery, while  spin-off effects in the ecosystem are difficult and expensive to  monitor. Exotics, often introduced by man, but sometimes  spreading far beyond the initial locations, have caused severe,  long-lasting impacts on many fragile island ecosystems.  Ocean-borne perturbations coming from fly-in or swim-in  biological aliens, as well as introductions from various  watercraft, are often beyond the manager's information until  in situ problems begin.  Bombs and Booms:  A special category of wilderness intrusion can be  assigned to U.S. military and reserve units in refuges. These  areas have been favored targets for military activities because  the generally low public use results in fewer complaints.  From low-level supersonic sorties emitting overpressures  13  known to damage buildings and wreck hikers' peace of  mind, to practice bombing with inert dummies and actual  live-fire strafing, the use of refuge system areas within and  adjacent to designated wilderness and wilderness study areas  can threaten the integrity of the areas and the concepts  embodied in the Wilderness Act. After years of requests to  find or construct alternative targets, only the prospect of  imminent lawsuit, and pressure from the new and more  environmentally aware Clinton Administration, finally brought  an end to practice bombing using inert devices on Copalis  NWR (part of the Washington Islands Wilderness). Congress  has yet to come to grips with the issues raised by such  activities.  Future Agenda for NWRS Wilderness  Gazing at the stars comes naturally to humans. Many  people believe the future of mankind is probably to be found  in new worlds of the limitless ether. However, according to  basic laws of physics looking at stars from earth is looking  into the past- perhaps, ultimately, to the beginning of time.  This juxtaposition of past and future is, I believe, germane to  natural resource management. For the answers to many of  the basic questions faced in wilderness and other natural  resource management, we must look outward from our  localized position as well as inward, and we must know  some history. We should make it standard practice to learn  enough of the past to ensure needed improvements are made  for the future.  In the limitless ether seen by my star gazing, FWS  administrators and managers will:  1. Develop an agency wilderness ethos that properly weds  the mandates of its land system with appropriate special  guidance provided for preserving the character of designated  wilderness. That ethos will be comprised of the cumulative  experiences, practices, and thinking of many minds. It will be  based on a clear understanding and thorough knowledge of  past and present interpretations of wilderness law, and it  14  ..._  should be advanced in the form of formal descriptive  guidelines, values, goals, techniques, and restrictions.  This new beginning should then be cultivated and  nurtured as part of an holistic wildlife conservation  philosophy that nests harmoniously within the ecosystem  management programs of the refuge system. Some of the  basic tenets and other aspects for developing this ethos exist  in the early documents done by that small cadre of NWRS  personnel that I spoke of earlier. Those early pol icy  documents and the refuge wilderness handbook should be  removed from their dusty storage boxes or files, refurbished,  and reissued. 9 Together, they provide essential historical  groundings in Wilderness Act concepts, vital definitions and  interpretations, and valuable potential as basic training  materials for FWS and refuge personnel. They form a solid  foundation from which that agency ethos can be developed  to integrate wilderness preservation and refuge system  management.  2. Develop the necessary budgetary documentation and  urgently seek new appropriations for the enormous and  growing requirements of refuge wilderness management.  The needs range from boundary surveys and posting, to  inventory, monitoring, research, education, interpretation, and  law enforcement. In addition, it should include mending  scars acquired in the past, recovering damaged elements,  initiating necessary minimum tool management actions, and  preserving wilderness character. The list is as full as the starry  desert sky over Cabeza Prieta NWR each spring. The special  needs of refuge wilderness cannot be met within the letter  and spirit of the Wilderness Act unless the NWRS supplies  adequately trained and equipped personnel in sufficient  numbers to reasonably cover the almost 21 million acres for  which it bears direct statutory responsibility.  3. Another part of what I see is the expansion that is likely  to occur in the next few years. Only 22 areas and about 2  million acres of the NWRS outside Alaska remain to be  considered for wilderness designation from the original  recommendations forwarded to Congress before 1974.  15  However, the potential for wilderness designations in Alaska  refuges could more than double the current acreage of refuge  wilderness. After the Alaska Lands Act was passed, refuge  staff and planning teams evaluated over 52 million acres of  refuge lands that are de facto wilderness and fully qualified  for designation under the Wilderness Act.  The FWS recommendations forwarded to the Secretary  of the Interior amounted to only 3,447,000 acres- less than  7 percent of the lands found to qualify for designation. This  in spite of the documented preference by the refuge managers  that 31.9 million acres be recommended, and the preference  by the regional planning teams that 26.9 million acres be  recommended. 10 The obviously deficient recommended  amount was based on restrictive criteria mandated by a  politically appointed FWS director nearly three years after the  studies had begun. However, no wilderness  recommendations for Alaska refuges have yet been forwarded  from the Secretary of the Interior to the President of the  United States, or from the President to the Congress. Thus, an  opportunity sti II exists to correct the deficiencies and to  complete the administrative process by having the President  forward recommendations that better recognize the  preferences of the refuge managers, those on-the-ground  people responsible for refuge stewardship.  Yet another major opportunity exists in the NWRS to  evaluate its lands and make further recommendations for  wilderness designation. Of the agencies subject to the  Wilderness Act, only the FWS has never adopted a policy of  evaluating lands added to the refuge system since 1964 that  may qualify for wilderness, or to periodically review refuge  areas adjacent to designated wilderness to determine if  additions are desirable. Thus, large, unroaded refuges such  as Sevilleta in New Mexico, Alligator River in North Carolina,  and several others that might add important new ecotypes to  the Wilderness Preservation System have not been eva I uated  by FWS. Between 1964 and 1994 the NWRS has been  enlarged by over 7 million acres outside of Alaska. With the  current emphasis toward ""ecosystem management,"" and given  the high priority being placed on the protection of  16  -...  -,  biodiversity by federal land agencies, it is wholly appropriate  for the FWS to adopt new policies initiating reviews of those  lands. Fresh reviews are warranted for areas such as Red  Rock Lakes NWR in Montana, Bitter Lakes NWR in New  Mexico, and numerous other refuges where refuge  acquisitions, or changes in activities on refuge lands adjacent  to designated wilderness, or other circumstances, offer  opportunities for expanding and improving these wilderness  areas.  A New Paradigm for Refuge Management  It is widely known that many state and federal wildlife  managers exhibit discomfort with wilderness concepts even  though Aldo Leopold, the ""father of wildlife management,""  and a founding father of the wilderness movement, felt no  such discomfort. The paradox arises, in my view, from the  game management paradigm instilled in wildlife agencies and  personnel with their educational groundings. That paradigm  has managers artfully creating or enhancing early seral stages  of forest succession, increasing ""edge"" effects, and taking  actions that maximize localized habitat diversity to produce  on-site diversity and high yield populations of desired game  animals. Increasingly, this paradigm is in disharmony with a  current emphasis on halting the extinction crisis and  stemming the loss of biodiversity by giving emphasis to  ecosystem management.  A new paradigm is needed for the refuge system. This  new model should provide for the maintenance and proper  management of those portions of refuge areas that, in the past,  have been unmanaged, neglected, and used only as a buffer  for the developed portions of the unit. Such areas can often  be managed under minimum intervention principles or in  conjunction with designated wilderness areas, research natural  areas, and other special value areas of the refuge. This  approach offers a spectrum of management intensities to  improve conditions for a broad array of migrant, endemic,  and other native species, thereby improving the long-term  17  contribution of the NWRS to the maintenance of natural  diversity. One could term this a ""holistic"" wildlife  management program that makes full utilization of refuge  system environments and management opportunities.  The first mandate of refuge system units is achievement  of the purposes for which they were established. In  designated wilderness, the preservation of wilderness  character (i.e. where the community of life is untrammeled,  affected primarily by the forces of nature with the imprint of  man's works substantially unnoticeable) is a prime directive.  Wilderness designation does not alter the underlying refuge  mandate, but requires management restraints to maintain  nature's primacy, to keep the imprint of works of man  largely unnoticeable, and to preserve the full range of  natural processes. When wilderness stewardship is viewed  as one component of a holistic wildlife management program  to protect and maintain the panoply of America's fish and  wildlife habitats, 11 it may be viewed as less exotic than  when viewed in isolation.  Wilderness as a Management Tool  Every tool used in wildlife management comes with  various constraints, and wilderness is no different in that  regard. just as deer prefer ""edges"" and ducks need wetlands,  grizzlies, desert bighorns, wolverines, and other animals  require wilderness habitat for survival in any semblance of  their natural communities. Much of America has been altered  and opportunities for managing lands to maintain early  successional stages for game species abound. Reasonably  large, unfragmented tracts of late seral stage and climax  vegetation are scarce and declining and yet they are essential  to many species. Wilderness is one tool we have to assure  those species will have places to rest and reproduce. Wildlife  managers, particularly refuge managers, should embrace  wilderness as a management tool if not as a research haven,  as a unique baseline resource or as a source of valuable  genetic material.  18  My star gazing has sent me to libraries and archives in  search of histories, definitions, principles, practices, and the  views of others such as Leopold, Murie, Olsen, and  Hochbaum. The information from those sources  demonstrates that along with its challenges, designated  wilderness in the refuge system offers managers  opportunities to:  1. Step beyond traditional management to the more complex  task of facilitating the process inherent in supporting all or  parts of major natural ecosystems;  2. Introduce the public to an understanding and appreciation  of the fascinating processes and ecological relationships  making these special places teem with communities of life, as  well as expose their unrivaled beauty to the people;  3. Develop and calibrate future management techniques to  restore pieces of our environmental heritage found later to be  essential;  4. Evaluate land and wildlife management and other  influences by man on natural community processes;  5. Gain public support and the resources to care for the  NWRS and its wilderness components; and  6. Reflect on man's role in wilderness, wildlife, and  ecosystem protection, and the meaning of stewardship.  19  Walt Whitman obviously had opportunities for that very  kind of reflection before he penned the following in Song of  Myself (sec. 31 ): 12  I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of  the stars,  And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the  egg of the wren,  And the tree-toad is a chef-d'ouvre for the highest,  And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven .. .  And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels .... [!]  The National Wildlife Refuge System offers all of us  insights and places where the seeds of inspiration can find  light for germination, growth, and maturity. In my star  gazing, my vision is one of opportunity for a vital segment  of man's future here on planet earth.  20  ENDNOTES  1. Nash, Roderick. 1969.

"Wilderness Management of Public Lands Administered by the Bureau of Land Management: Past, Present & Future",Michael Dombeck,"Lecture given by Michael Dombeck, acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Opening remarks given by Edwin E. Krumpe, principal scientist for the Wilderness Research Center and professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introduction by John C. Hendee director of the UI Wilderness Research Center and former dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences. The lecture opens with the theme for the past three lectures and how this lecture about the BLM will match that theme as well. The history of the BLM and the Wilderness Act is breifly gone over as well as how their relationship was affected by the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). Then the current status of the BLM and the FLPMA is given an overview. An inventory of BLM land was taken and the result was 26,000,000 acres were recommended for wilderness designation. That land was managed differently than other BLM lands and designated Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). Studies were then conducted on these lands, attempting to find out if the area was better suitable for wilderness or nonwilderness uses, the process of how that is answered is further described in the lecture. At the time the lecture was given all studies had been completed and the recommendations from those studies were pending in Congress. During the 1980's time was taken to prepare for these new wilderness areas by creating management policies, borrowing heavily from the other wilderness agencies. Some areas were designated by congress as wilderness in order for the BLM too put these management policies into practice. Vision is cast for the near future of managing these lands, much of that happening in the political realm. A description of the diversity of BLM lands is given based on physical, socio-economic, and institutional and management charactersitics. The lecture ends will a call for the public to take part in caring for wilderness on BLM lands.

Krumpe  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the four­teenth  in the annual series of Wilderness Resource Distin­guished  Lectureships sponsored by the University of Idaho  Wilderness Research Center. The Center's mission is to  promote research and educational activities to further our  understanding of wilderness and natural ecosystems and  man's relationships to them. Our goal is to gain knowledge  that can be applied to better manage our designated wilder­ness  areas so that the pub I ic can enjoy sustained use and  benefits from our wilderness resources. Since its inception in  1972, the Center has supported research projects in Idaho  and the Pacific Northwest, with over thirty studies com­pleted  just in the last two decades.  The Center also helps sponsor four university courses,  giving students opportunity to study wilderness principles  and practices, wilderness field ecology, and, in the case of  intern students, to gain first hand experience in wilderness  management and research. At the national level the Center  has sponsored a national conference on wilderness manage­ment,  two national task forces, and conducted workshops  and presentations at many other national and international  research conferences.  Of our long-standing education traditions, the one in  which we take most pride is the annual Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureship. In what has become a fine  academic tradition, the Wilderness Research Center has  sponsored the lectureship to encourage constructive dia-lll  Iogue and to broaden our understanding of the management  and meaning of wilderness resources. Speakers of national  prominence have been invited on the basis of their contribu­tions  to the philosophical and scientific rationale of wilder­ness  management.  Tonight we continue this tradition as we hear the fourth  in a mini-series of lectures designed to present a ""vision for  wilderness"" in the four federal agencies responsible for  managing the National Wilderness Preservation System-­the  Forest Service, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.  The agency that has the shortest history in managing the 1 04  million acres in the National Wilderness Preservation System  is the Bureau of Land Management, which currently admin­isters  68 wildernesses containing nearly 1.7 million acres of  designated wilderness.  To this end we are honored to present Dr. Mike  Dombeck who for the past year has served as Acting Direc­tor  of the Bureau of Land Management.

VI  BLM lands in New Mexico  WILDERNESS  MANAGEMENT OF  PUBLIC LANDS  ADMINISTERED BY THE  BUREAU OF LAND  MANAGEMENT: PAST,  PRESENT AND FUTURE  Michael Dombeck  Thank you for the opportunity to present this lecture.  Lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management  (BLM) have much to contribute to the National Wilderness  Preservation System (hereafter referred to as ""System""). I  hope my presentation will demonstrate their contributions  both in the present and in the future.  The theme of the current series of Distinguished Wilder­ness  Resource Lectures has been the wilderness potential of  public lands managed by the four wilderness managing  agencies and visions of how that potential can be realized.  We are honored that BLM was saved until the other  wilderness agencies (National Park Service, U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service) presented their  1  viewpoints and visions. I like to think the best was saved for  last. Further, being last I should be able to capitalize on the  previous presentations. BLM currently has the smallest  amount of acreage of the federal agencies managing public  lands included in the Wilderness System, but we have what I  feel is a well founded wilderness management program that  we have worked hard to build.  Having just concluded the celebration of the 30th Anni­versary  of the Wilderness Act, we have heard a lot about the  future for wilderness, and that has been the theme of your  lectures. I hope that my presentation on the BLM wilderness  program will contribute to the vision for the future of wilder­ness.  Background  As hindsight is always easier than foresight, let me start  here. To make a long story short, BLM lands were not  included in the provisions of the Wilderness Act when it was  enacted in 1964. Why were these lands left out and/or  excluded from the Wilderness Act? A review of the legisla­tive  history of the Wilderness Act indicates an absence of  discussion about including BLM lands. Apparently in 1964  it was still an open issue whether the BLM lands should  remain in federal ownership or were to be disposed of, with  BLM going out of business. BLM lands were viewed as the  lands nobody wanted, leftovers, remnants, or to quote some  -forgotten legacy lands. I might add at this point, this  oversight of BLM lands in the nation's wilderness program  has since been remedied.  BLM lands were viewed as the lands  nobody wanted, leftovers, rem-nants,  or to quote some - ,#  fi_o_r_g_o_tt_en_le_g_a_c_y_la_n_d_s_. ___ ~ ___ _  2  During the various debates leading up to passage of the  Federal Lands Policy and Management Act of 1976  (FLPMA), the so-called ""BLM Organic Act,"" this oversight  was corrected when numerous arguments surfaced for  including a wilderness review provision in this act to make  BLM lands subject to the Wilderness Act.  FLPMA provided a clear statement of congressional  objectives and mandates on retention and management of  the public lands administered by BLM; Congress decided  that BLM was not going out of business. Included in the  various provisions of FLPMA was a special directive for BLM  to undertake the study of its public lands and to make  recommendations to the President of the United States as to  which of the public lands administered by BLM were suit­able  for designation as wilderness and should be included in  the National Wilderness Preservation System to be managed  under the Wilderness Act. It was with the enactment of  FLPMA then that BLM lands, and BLM as a management  agency, joined the other three agencies as a full partner in  management of the Wilderness System. No longer are the  BLM lands forgotten!  To give you the background perspective of how BLM got  to where we are today I will give you a short history of the  Wilderness Study Program undertaken by BLM under  FLPMA to bring you up to date.  Current Status  The FLPMA specified the various activities which were to  be undertaken in the review and study of the public lands  administered by the BLM. The FLPMA also set deadlines for  reporting wilderness recommendations and specified how  the lands under wilderness review were to be managed, and  continue to be managed, pending final Congressional  action.  3  The various phases involved in the BLM wilderness  program include 1) the inventory of BLM public lands for  wilderness characteristics; 2) protection of areas under  wilderness review; 3) research of identified wilderness study  areas (WSAs); 4) report of recommendations to the Secretary  of the Interior; and 5) management of all wilderness areas  designated by Congress to preserve their natural character.  Inventory  The FLPMA required the BLM to review all roadless  public land areas of 5,000 acres or more, and roadless  islands, to identify those with the required wilderness char­acteristics.  Areas less than 5,000 acres can also be consid­ered  in certain circumstances under the basic planning  authority of the FLPMA. To guide the inventory on the 174  million acres of BLM land in the lower 48 states (Alaska was  not included in the original inventory), the BLM developed a  Wilderness Inventory Handbook. The handbook called for a  two-step inventory process. Both steps involved broad  public involvement.  During the initial inventory conducted between 1978 and  1979, areas that were generally recognized by the BLM and  the public as obviously having no wilderness characteristics  were eliminated from further wilderness review. This initial  evaluation reduced the acreage under consideration to  about 50 mi II ion acres.  With this acreage as the focus, the BLM began the inten­sive  inventory. During this phase, conducted between 1979  and 1980, BLM resource professionals conducted on-the­ground  inspections of each area to determine the presence  or absence of wilderness characteristics. Public participation  was encouraged, both during the field inspections and the  public review of the BLM's intensive inventory findings. The  pub I ic was responsive; more than 1 0,000 comments were  received from across the country. At the end of the inven-  4  tory, the BLM designated the areas possessing the basic  characteristics as wilderness study areas or WSAs.  At the completion of the inventory phase, BLM deter­mined  that over 26,000,000 acres, comprising over 800  wilderness study areas, located in 11 western states, qual i­fied  for further study to determine whether such areas should  be recommended for wilderness designation.  Interim Protection and Management of Wilderness  Study Areas  These WSAs are managed differently than the rest of our  public lands. Interim management applies until the time a  final decision is made by Congress as to whether they  become part of the National Wilderness Preservation System  or are released for non-wilderness uses.  To help the public understand which activities could and  could not be authorized in WSAs, the BLM developed, with  the public's help, the Interim Management Policy and  Guidelines for Lands Under Wilderness Review.  The pol icy closely follows the congressional mandate  and provides that new activities be allowed in a WSA if they  meet what is called the ""nonimpairment"" standard con­tained  in the FLPMA. Congress said that lands under wilder­ness  review were to be managed ""so as not to impair the  su itabi I ity of such areas for preservation as wilderness."" To  meet this standard, activities must not cause any significant  impacts. Depending on climate, soils, and topography, this  standard can accommodate some types of activities, but any  long-term development will depend on Congress' wilderness  decision.  Congress also said certain mining and grazing uses  already in existence when the FLPMA was passed could  continue. Commonly called ""grandfathered uses,"" the law  5  says these activities can continue in the same ""manner and  degree"" as when the FLPMA became law. Valid existing  rights, such as valid claims under the 1872 Mining Law and  mineral leases issued before October 21, 1976, are eligible  for full development. Like all activities on public lands  however, they must be conducted in a manner that prevents  ""undue or unnecessary degradation"" as directed by the  FLPMA. Applying such complex legal criteria on the ground  on a case-by-case basis is a challenge. The BLM works very  closely with all interested parties to ensure that interim  management fully meets the requirements of the law.  Wilderness Study Areas  Once public land areas possessing the basic wilderness  characteristics specified by Congress were identified, de­tailed  wilderness studies began. To guide this effort, the BLM  developed, again with the public's help, its Wilderness  Study Policy. The primary goal of the BLM wilderness study  process is to analyze an area's su itabi I ity or nonsu itabi I ity for  preservation as wilderness. This analysis is made through the  BLM's established land use planning system based on the  resource data, evaluations made by BLM resource profes­sionals  in the field, and public comments. The wilderness  values in the WSA are evaluated in the context of all the  other multiple uses present in the area. The analysis is  accompanied by an environmental impact statement and  released for public review.  The central question in a wilderness study is: ""Is this area  more suitable for wilderness designation or more suitable for  nonwilderness uses?"" To answer this question, the study  examines each WSA from three different standpoints: what  are the area's wilderness values? What effect would wilder­ness  designation have upon present and potential uses of the  area? And what does the public think?  6  In analyzing wilderness values, the BLM considers the  quality of the area's natural ness, its opportunities for solitude  or for primitive unconfined recreation, and any special  features such as geological, ecological, scientific, educa­tional,  scenic, or historical values. The study also analyzes  whether wilderness designation would have any beneficial  effect upon other resource uses and whether designation of a  particular WSA would contribute to expanding the diversity  of the National Wilderness Preservation System.  In the wilderness study process, trade-offs between  wilderness and non-wilderness uses are examined closely.  The BLM identifies all uses and potential uses of the WSA  other than wilderness (such as energy and minerals or timber  production) and analyzes how wilderness designation would  affect these potential uses. The BLM then evaluates how the  land would be managed if the WSA is not designated as  wilderness, and analyzes how this type of management  would affect these wilderness values.  Studies also examine the local social and economic  effects of wilderness designation and consider whether  designation would be consistent with existing land use plans  of state and local governments, Indian tribes, and other  federal agencies. Once the BLM completes its field studies  and the public reviews the draft findings and recommenda­tions,  the Geological Survey and Bureau of Mines complete  mineral studies on areas initially recommended by the BLM  as suitable for wilderness designation.  Reporting Study Recommendations  The FLPMA required the Secretary of the Interior to  complete the review of the public lands for wilderness  potential and report the findings to the President of the  United States within 15 years (i.e. by October 21, 1991).  The secretary's reports included the BLM's final suitability  report, the final environmental impact statement including  7  analyses of public comments, the public hearings records,  and the mineral evaluations conducted by the Geological  Survey and the Bureau of Mines on any area recommended  as suitable for wilderness .  ... BLM manages 137 individual wilderness areas  containing some 5,241,000 acres  which comprise over 5% of the  N--a-tz-·o_n_a_l_w_z_·z-de_r_n_e_s_s_P_r_e_se_r_v_a_-__ f/l­tion  System Lands ...  '~  The final step of the reporting process is for the President  of the United States to make recommendations to Congress.  Only Congress can designate an area as part of the National  Wilderness Preservation System. However, sometimes  Congress considers an area for wilderness preservation even  if the studies are still ongoing and no Presidential recom­mendation  has been made. When this occurs, the Depart­ment  of the Interior testifies on the legislation using all  available information to give Congress an idea of the area's  su itabi I ity or nonsu itabi I ity for wilderness preservation. This  situation occurred with the BLM Arizona areas when Con­gress  in November 1990 designated over 1 million acres as  wilderness.  All phases of the BLM road less area review and wilder­ness  study process are now essentially completed. On june  21, 1991, the secretary submitted recommendations to the  President for California and on October 1 8, 1991, the States  of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Or­egon,  Utah, and Wyoming. The President, after evaluation of  the recommendations, concurred with the recommendations  and transmitted them to the Congress over the period of May  1992 to january 1993. All recommendations are currently  pending before the U.S. Congress. Special legislation in  8  1993 and again in 1994 affected certain BLM lands in  Colorado and California, resulting in approximately  3,600,000 additional wilderness acres being designated and  affecting BLM lands.  At the present time, BLM manages 137 individual wilder­ness  areas containing some 5,241 ,000 acres which comprise  over five percent of the National Wilderness Preservation  System lands, now approaching 104 million acres. While  still the smallest acreage in the system, BLM is rapidly  gaining on the other agencies and as our wilderness report­ing  packages and recommendations are enacted into law by  the Congress, we will become a major player in the manage­ment  of the entire wilderness system.  Evolution of Wilderness Management Policy  BLM spent most of the decade of the 1980s conducting  wilderness studies and preparing reports and recommenda­tions  to the President and Congress on BLM lands consid­ered  suitable for wilderness designation. However, BLM did  not spend all of their time and effort on wilderness paper­work.  With some luxury of time before large wilderness  acreage designations started, BLM was able to get a head  start on management policies in anticipation of future  designations. During the 1980s BLM wilderness program  staff developed wilderness management policies for BLM  lands. The approach taken was to essentially ""beg, borrow,  or steal"" the best from the other wilderness agency materials  and methods. By being selective, BLM was able to cannibal­ize  what they considered the best from the other agencies  while at the same time screen out information and ap­proaches  we considered inappropriate or not applicable to  BLM lands or conditions. For the most part BLM borrowed  heavily from the U.S. Forest Service wilderness management  policies because they are a multiple use management  agency like us. The National Park Service and Fish and  Wildlife Service policies often did not seem to fit as well  since their missions are more limited.  9  Additionally, during the 1980s BLM participated in as  many wilderness management workshops, seminars, and  conferences as possible to obtain information. Participation  by BLM personnel in training programs on wilderness  offered by the other agencies was also encouraged. In short,  BLM took every possible opportunity to buy time, gain lead  time, and get out ahead on wilderness management before it  happened. Of particular importance was the BLM's partici­pation  in the first National Wilderness Management Work­shop  held here in Moscow, Idaho, in October 1983, under  the auspices of the University of Idaho. Out of that work­shop  developed a major policy document with respect to  wilderness, entitled ""A Five-Year Action Program."" This  document served as a policy framework for all wilderness  agencies and particularly for BLM. It served as our overview  approach to wilderness during the 1980s.  The B LM made a major management commitment to  implement as many of the action program's recom­mendations  as possible, again with the goal of getting out  ahead of the curve on designation of BLM lands. What was  particularly unique in the action program was that it repre­sented  a consensus approach to wilderness management by  the affected system management agencies, as well as a  significant commitment by other interest groups and organi­zations  to wilderness management objectives.  As evidence of the value the action program served, it  should be noted that the major product from the recent 6th  National Wilderness Conference held in Santa Fe, New  Mexico, in November 1994, was the revisiting, updating,  and expansion of the previous action program to serve as the  wilderness management document for the next decade. It is  the BLM objective to have the new action program serve  again as our framework into the next century.  10  As an additional incentive to keep BLM going in the  1980s, Congress also saw fit to designate as wilderness a few  areas scattered in parts of the states of Oregon, California,  Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, and Arizona. With these  areas the BLM was able to ""practice"" wilderness manage­ment  using the experience and materials developed early in  the 1980s. This ""learning through doing"" approach was of  great value to BLM when the first large increment of BLM  lands was designated as wilderness in November 1990 with  passage of the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990; 38  areas totaling approximately 1,200,000 acres were added to  the system. With this significant additional acreage BLM  entered wilderness management in a big way. As B LM  studies were packaged on a statewide basis and submitted to  Congress, it became imminent that significant BLM wilder­ness  designations and additions to the system will be a  reality. For example, the California Desert Protection Act of  1994 included more than 3,500,000 acres of BLM land, and  this excluded remaining BLM wilderness study lands in  Central and Northern California .  .. .it seems reasonable that BLM will ultimately  have 10-15 million acres more in the Wilderness  System ... with that much land as  wilderness, BLM is a major player.  Near-Term Vision for BLM Wilderness Program  Visualizing the near-term status does not require clairvoy­ance  on my part. The program essentially consists of con­tinuing  to provide effective management of the 5.2 million  acres of BLM lands currently designated as wilderness while  continuing to support the legislative process in designating  additional BLM areas.  The legislative phase will continue to be the ""flashy"" part  11  of the program with a high degree of controversy, special  interest group attention, intensive lobbying efforts from all  sides, and fractious Congressional and public debate. It  seems clear that the Congress will deal with BLM wilderness  designations through the rather painful state-by-state ap­proach.  It is also clear that this sequence of events will  stretch over many years, with final resolution even in doubt  as to when it will be concluded. Battles will continue on  such diverse topics as release language, aircraft overflights,  water rights, the balance of acreage in gains and losses, use  of motorized equipment, vehicular access, access for the  disabled, grazing of domestic livestock, acquisition of  privately owned inholdings, and mining.  What the final BLM wilderness acreage count will be is  beyond even my special powers as acting director to predict.  With the current BLM wilderness recommendations of about  9 million acres, not including Alaska, combined with the  legislative history of Congress designating about one-third  more acreage than agencies have recommended, it seems  reasonable that BLM will ultimately have 10 to 15 million  acres or more in the Wilderness System. Clearly, with that  I  ,./  ~-L_ ~  ~,v•-::~;:::=..,:--':::~,  Moonhouse ruin at Cedar Mesa. BLM land, Utah.  12  much land as wilderness, BLM is a major player. Beyond  these observations, I will not speculate as to Wilderness  System totals. Remember, only God and Congress can make  a wilderness.  The ""not so flashy"" part of the BLM wilderness program  consists of taking care of what we've got. BLM is currently  responsible for the management of over 137 individual  wilderness areas, located in ten states, containing over 5.2  million acres of designated wilderness as part of the system.  This acreage already in the system requires active manage­ment  by BLM if it is to remain viable as part of the system.  The management workload for these areas is imposing. For  example: boundaries have to be identified and mapped;  signing and public information materials must be prepared;  ranger patrol activities are needed to man itor use and to  eliminate unauthorized uses such as motor vehicle intru­sions;  management plans for each area have to be prepared  with full public input; and fire and wildlife management  plans must be in place. Failure by BLM to do a good job of  wilderness management on our designated wilderness  jeopardizes not only the BLM wilderness lands but the entire  system. BLM is committed to the Wilderness System and our  role in it. We will continue to be as effective as possible in  the management of wilderness areas under our jurisdiction.  Long-Term Vision for the BLM Wilderness Program  If I have to advance what single term or word best de­scribes  what BLM lands bring to the system it would have to  be ""diversity."" There is no doubt that the BLM wilderness  areas are different from most of the rest of the system lands,  yet they are integral components of that system. It is these  differences which bring greater strength and potential  weakness to the system.  • Physical Characteristics  To a great extent, BLM wilderness lands represent differ­ent  ecotypes than those wild lands of other agencies. The  13  BLM areas are low desert, high desert, and basin land areas.  They typically are at lower elevations, are less rugged/  mountainous, or are rolling to front range type topographic  rei ief. Additionally, these areas are much smaller in size  than most of the wilderness managed by the U.S. Forest  Service, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, where a number of their individual wilderness areas  exceed one million acres, and areas in the six figure acreage  are quite common. Being located in the arid areas, the BLM  areas tend to exhibit geomorphic and geologic land forms  not normally found in the higher, wetter, and more tree­covered  parts of the system.  The location of the BLM areas also means that most of  these areas are dry (no water) with no fuel (no trees or with  limited brush), have no shade (no trees), and provide limited  opportunities for overnight or longer term camping or hiking  opportunities. Because of the lower elevation of these areas,  they tend to be in closer proximity to urban or community  centers than other agency wilderness areas which are  typically more remote from population centers. Many of the  BLM wilderness areas also have highway, road, or trail  access to them or along their exterior boundaries. In part,  this situation evolved from the study process which, in order  to identify roadless areas, used roads as exterior boundary  delineators, thus creating roadless areas with adjoining road  access. This easy vehicle access to BLM wilderness areas  contrasts with those of the other wilderness agencies where  remoteness from road networks requires visitors to hike or  ride horseback over many miles to reach the wilderness  areas.  • Socio-Economic Characteristics  Most BLM wilderness areas had, and have, a history of  previous use and authorizations for such activities as grazing  of domestic livestock, hardrock mining, oil and gas leasing,  off road vehicle driving, hunting and fishing using motorized  14  vehicles, snowmobiling, rockhounding, and numerous other  multiple use activities which, with certain exceptions, are  grandfathered as valid existing rights and uses.  In addition to the use history of the BLM wilderness  areas, a large number of the areas are in geographic loca­tions  where climate, weather, and elevation enable virtually  year-round or all-season use of the areas. The BLM areas are  ""open all year"" which is different from many of the other  agency wilderness areas which are only summer or early fall  areas with naturally limited use after the ""snow flies."" The  BLM areas, also due to their smaller size, access by road,  and being close to towns, are essentially day use areas or  weekend-only areas, as opposed to a number of other  agency wilderness areas where week-long, expedition-type  hiking and camping, and outfitter-/guides/packstrings may  be operating. Another unfortunate reality is that a large  number of BLM wilderness areas are ""noisy."" That is, they  are located in areas subject to overflights and lowflying  military and civilian aircraft operations. The solitude and  lack thereof as quiet refuges from machine noises do not  exist in a number of BLM wilderness areas and may in the  future intensify due to more constricted public land avail­ability  for such activities. Thus, the sound .of quiet may be  further limited in the future on BLM wilderness areas.  The BLM wilderness areas also contain thousands of  acres of state and privately owned inholdings due to land  patterns and scattered ownerships throughout the western  United States. The legacy of the land settlement pattern in  the West rests with BLM as the custodian of the remaining  open public land areas. The ownership patterns are such  that ""inholders"" in BLM wilderness areas will require transit  across BLM wilderness area lands to reach their inholdings.  By law, BLM must allow such access, or in other cases  acquire or exchange lands to eliminate the inholdings and  block in the BLM ownership.  15  The BLM lands round out the Wilderness  System with the diversity our f.~ -l'  lands bring... ,  ' ''-""'-  Thus, the wilderness stewardship challenges for BLM are  imposing and I have only touched on a few of the more  obvious ones in this lecture. Most of you know full well the  stories of wildfires, global warming, noxious weed invasions,  air quality, water pollution, insect and disease intrusions,  and a big list of other issues which continues to grow in  severity and magnitude and affect the Wilderness System.  • Institutional and Management Characteristics  Finally, I will conclude by discussing what I think are the  greatest opportunities for contributions by BLM wilderness  and wilderness managers. They are diverse. The BLM has  both great constraints under which we operate as well as  great opportunities for applying creative and innovative  wilderness management. I like to tease my colleagues in the  U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, that anybody could manage their wilder­ness  areas because they're so ""easy."" They don't have all of  the ""baggage"" associated with them, as is the case with the  BLM areas. Of course they disagree with me, but I still like  to rub it in. The management challenges imposed by the de  facto situations in BLM wilderness areas will test the abilities  of our managers to cope and deal with diverse situations.  We will have to find new methods for dealing with the  public in our management practices.  Direct, hands-on ranger type law enforcement methods  will not work. In addition, we don't have enough personnel  to send to the field in such an approach. Indirect, educa­tional,  and informational methods will work best. Environ­mental  education, brochures, visitor centers, bulletin boards,  maps, and the like will have to be used in lieu of BLM staff.  16  Greater use of volunteers will include senior citizen guides,  partnerships with interest groups, and ""Adopt-A-Wilderness""  programs by local organizations. These creative and coop­erative  approaches will all have to be fully utilized to cover  the workload. More collaborative management with adja­cent  land owners, state and local governments, Indian tribes,  and use of private sector contractors wi II have to be consid­ered.  Less confrontation and more cooperation must be the  hallmark of BLM wilderness management to get the job  done. BLM wilderness managers will consider and solicit  help from any and all possible sources.  BLM is also fully supportive of and involved in several  major initiatives to expand multi-agency cooperation in  wilderness research, education, and information sharing.  For example, we are involved in the newly established Aldo  Leopold Wilderness Research Institute in Montana. We are  involved in new training, education and information pro­grams  under the leadership of the interagency Arthur Carhart  National Wilderness Training Center. We are an organiza­tional  sponsor of the newly established International journal  of Wilderness being launched here at the University of Idaho  Wilderness Research Center. And BLM will continue to play  a major role in the ongoing series of national wilderness  conferences and World Wilderness Congresses.  I conclude my presentation at this point with an invita­tion  to all of you in the audience, and all who will read this  presentation, and any others we can recruit to assist the BLM  in the management of the areas under our jurisdiction in the  National Wilderness Preservation System. The BLM lands  round out the Wilderness System with the diversity our lands  bring to the system. This means we will have unique and  diverse challenges. We need, and welcome, your assistance.  17  Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureships  1977 Sen. Frank Church Wilderness in a Balanced Land-Use Framework  1978 Roderick Nash  1979 Cecil D.

A Vision for Wilderness in the Nation,Jon Roush,"Lecture given by Jon Roush, president of the Wilderness Society. Opening remarks given by James R. Fazio, professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism, College of Foretry, Wildlife and Range Sciences. Introduction given by John C. Hendee director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lecture opens discussing the previous lectures in the series and how this lecture will differ from the rest. The lecture will detail the threats to wilderness and what can be done to stop them. The lecture clarifies that a threat against wilderness is a threat against wilderness values and then asks the question why we have those values in the first place. We value wilderness for diversity, immediate utility, spirituality (spiritual healing), 'land ethic' because it is ethical to value and protect it. The biggest threat that the lecturer focuses on is population growth. The exponential rate at which the world's population is growing is highlighted. The fact that earth's resources are finite is addressed, in particular food and water resources. A discussion is made about the possibility of the U.S. declining their consumption and lowering their standard of living, but the lecturer says this isn't a solution, it's an inevitability. China is contrasted to our nation as a picture of what we could become, but not one we want to emulate. The consquences of a doubled population in the U.S. by 2020 are discussed. One of those consquences that is detailed in length is the incresed use of wilderness recreation areas, national parks and national forests. The other change that comes with an increasing population is unpredictable cultural change; shifts in perception, even what is right and wrong, regarding wilderness. 'Our wilderness system depends... on people's willingness to take the long view, to act responsibly toward future generations, and to give up some personal gain for the common good.' Two issues for safegaurding wilderness against this danger are explored: How to build an informed, diverse consituency for wilderness and how to confront population issues directly and openly. The lecture then turns to public land policy. A call is given to complete the federal wilderness system while there is still time, wilderness designation and land aquisition are also priorities. But the most crucial element is wilderness management. The National Wildlife Refuge System is used for many purposes other than being a refuge to wildlife, the purpose of these systems must be spelled out in the legislature and enforced. Agencies should combine forces to manage wilderness in tandem. Our goals for wilderness can no longer be economical, but rather ecological. Legislators cannot become lax about environmental regulations put on private land. Our actions and regulations now will affect the overpopulated generations of the future.

Illustrations by Lorraine Ashland.  IV  Foreward  James R. Fazio  Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to  the fifteenth Distinguished Wilderness Lectureship. My  name is Jim Fazio and in an earlier age I was head of the  Department of what we called then ""Wildland Recreation  Management,"" now known as Resource Recreation and  Tourism. And with that duty-at least for a few years-came  the directorship of the Wilderness Research Center.  I am glad to be here tonight (and to see such a nice  turnout). Some of us can remember launching this Distin­guished  Wilderness Lecture Series back in 1977. And very  appropriately that first speaker was Senator Frank Church,  and we held it over at the Student Union, in the ballroom.  There were over 800 people there-standing room only-  1 ive TV coverage, and phone hookups so people from  around Idaho could call in questions.  And following that in this series of lectures we have had  author Roderick Nash exploring the concept and future of  wilderness, and then Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus,  asking rhetorically, ""Why not combine the USFS and BLM  into a single agency, the Department of Natural Resources?""  Not sure Mr. Andrus found out why not, but we certainly did  not, and still have the two agencies managing wilderness  and other resources with pretty much the same methods and  goals. And there was Patrick Noonan, executive director of  The Nature Conservancy, suggesting that contrary to what  Aldo Leopold said about wilderness having to be large  enough to absorb a two-week trip by pack animal, maybe  we need small areas too.  v  Marshes and woodlands that may harbor rare plants or  animals ... little islands of roadless areas near where people  live ... maybe places like Grandmother Mountain. And there  was Oren Lyons presenting the Native American perspec­tive,  and reminding us that wilderness is really the invention  of white man because to the Indian there was no wilder­ness-  it was all home. And there were many more. Jon  Roush will continue that tradition tonight.  Now of course the Wilderness Research Center does  other things besides sponsor this lecture series. The Center's  mission is to promote research and educational activities to  further our understanding of wilderness and natural ecosys­tems  and human relationships to them. The goal is to gain  knowledge that can be applied to better manage our desig­nated  wilderness areas so that the pub I ic can enjoy sus­tained  use and benefits from wilderness. Since its inception  in 1972, the Center has supported research in Idaho and  throughout the Northwest, with over 30 studies completed  and many more in progress.  The Center helps sponsor university courses, internships,  workshops-it has hosted a national conference on wilder­ness,  and has been deeply involved in several international  conferences. Today it is helping launch an exciting new  international journal on wilderness issues.  But I personally believe that this lectures series is the  jewel in the crown of the Wilderness Research Center. Most  recently, the lectures have focused on ""visions for wilder­ness""  from the perspectives of the national forests presented  by our friend Bill Worf; the national parks, with Roger  Contor; refuges of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pre­sented  by Bill Reffalt; and earlier this month, BLM's perspec­tive,  presented by Acting Director Mike Dombeck.  Now, one thing I didn't tell you about that very first  lecture by Senator Church: there was a young fellow there  who worked for the Forest Service but was serving as a  Vl  congressional fellow on Senator Church's staff. He helped  write that presentation and was running around the SUB  making sure everything was just right and that nothing  would go wrong to create any embarrassments. That young  fellow was John Hendee, now the Director of the University  of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. Dr. Hendee will now  introduce our speaker for tonight.  james R. Fazio is professor in the Department of Resource  Recreation and Tourism1 College of Forestry1 Wildlife and  Range Sciences. He has been associate dean of academics  and continuing education in the college and has served as  editor for two newsletters of The National Arbor Day Foun­dation.  vii  Introduction  John C. Hendee  I 1  m very pleased to introduce Dr. G. Jon Roush, the  fifteenth speaker in the Distinguished Wilderness Resource  Lectureship series. Dr. Roush is leader of the largest wilder­ness  advocacy organization in the world. We are honored to  have him at our university, in our college, and in Idaho  today. Jon is a scholar, a planner, a rancher, and a seasoned  conservationist.  Dr. Roush was appointed President of The Wilderness  Society in January 1994. After receiving his Ph.D. in English  from the University of California at Berkeley, he was an  assistant professor of Literature and Humanities at Reed  College and a program officer of the Carnegie Corporation  of New York. Jon has worked for The Nature Conservancy,  first in the west and then as Executive Vice President. He has  served on several nonprofit boards, including The Nature  Conservancy (where he served two terms as chair), The  Conservation Fund, the Northern Rockies Action Group, the  Northern Lights Institute, and the Montana Land Reliance.  Jon has published numerous articles and book chapters in  the fields of management, conservation, education, litera­ture,  and the arts.  I've walked in the wilderness with Jon, I've watched him  dialogue with wilderness managers, and I've listened to his  provocative ideas. He thinks big thoughts and his vision is  far-reaching and thoughtful. Ladies and gentlemen, please  welcome our distinguished wilderness lecturer, Dr. Jon  Roush, who will present ""A Vision for Wilderness in the  Nation.""  Vlll  john C. Hendee is director of the University of Idaho Wilder­ness  Research Center, managing editor of the International  journal of Wilderness, and former dean of the College of  Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences.  IX  A VISION FOR  WILDERNESS IN THE  NATION  Jon Roush  Collectively, the preceding lectures in this ""vision for  wilderness"" series have presented an inspiring picture of one  of our nation's greatest successes. Thirty years ago, Congress  passed the 1964 Wilderness Act in order to ""secure for  American people of present and future generations the  benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness."" If you  attended the previous lectures, you heard leaders of the four  federal agencies that administer the National Wilderness  Preservation System speak with justifiable pride of the past  successes and future visions.  Rather than repeat what you already have heard about  the present wilderness system, I want to provide a capstone  for future thinking. The managers of our public wilderness  lands already have a formidable task. Threats to our wilder­ness  system are ecological, economic, political, and social,  but one overriding force will drive all the other threats. That  force is population growth, and it could lead to tragedy.  Luckily, we can take steps to avert the tragedy. In this  lecture, I will describe the threats and what I think must be  done.  1  Threats to Wilderness  To understand the threats, we need to understand what is  at stake. When we protect wilderness, we are protecting  more than land; we are protecting certain values that land  embodies. The federal wilderness system is more than land.  It is a complex set of relationships between people and the  land. Through those relationships, we express what we value  in wild land. A threat to wilderness is a threat to our wilder­ness  values.  What are these values that have led our nation to invest  in wilderness? We have legally designated over one hundred  million acres of public land as wilderness under the Wilder­ness  Act, more than half of it in Alaska. In the aggregate, the  wilderness system is as large as the state of California. On all  that land, we allow no roads, nothing motorized like trail  bikes or chainsaws, no logging or mining, no cabins, dams,  or other structures. We have decreed that on this land, this  wilderness, nothing mechanized will interfere with natural  communities and natural processes. Why would we do that,  and why are wilderness advocates calling for even more  land to be added to the system?  Why Save Wilderness?  People have advanced many reasons for saving wilder­ness,  but they boil down to four arguments. The first is the  value of diversity. Wilderness is essential for the preservation  of biological diversity and rare and endangered species. The  most common reason for loss of diversity is loss of habitat.  The complexity of wild land ecosystems makes it impossible  to predict all the consequences of manipulating, fragment­ing,  or diminishing habitat critical for biological diversity.  Therefore, the prudent approach is to leave it alone as much  as possible.  The second argument for protecting wilderness is its  immediate utility. Wilderness provides unique and essential  products or services essential for human well-being. Wild  2  lands are essential parts of larger systems. For example,  because it stores and purifies water, wild land is an essential  part of many of our largest municipal water systems and  rural irrigation systems .  ... the four values that lead us to protect wilder­ness  [are] diversity, utility, quality of life, and  responsible ethics.  The third argument is the value of spirituality and spiri­tual  healing. Wild land improves the quality of human life.  Our species has spent virtually all its existence in diverse  natural habitats, from our earliest beginnings in African  forests and savannahs.  The fourth argument is the value of ethical behavior.  This argument was developed elegantly by Aldo Leopold in  his essay ""The Land Ethic."" Leopold argued that we have an  ethical responsibility to the land, by which he-meant not just  soil and water but the living community of species that  inhabits the land. In the land ethic, he said, a human being  becomes not conqueror of the land community but plain  citizen of it. An ethical citizen, Leopold argues, treats other  members of the land community with humility and respect.  So the land ethic acknowledges that all species have a right  to exist and, at least in some places, to exist in their natural  state. As I understand it, those are the four values that lead  us to protect wilderness: diversity, utility, quality of life, and  responsible ethics.  Expanding Global Populations  Population growth is a direct threat to these values and to  wild land itself. Now listen to the following numbers and ask  yourself whether the aforementioned values are not in  jeopardy: the global population is expanding at a rate  approaching one billion people per decade. Let me put that  3  number in perspective. After millions of years of human  history on the Earth, the population of the whole planet  finally reached one billion people around the year 1850. In  the next 80 years, by 1930, we had added another billion.  We needed only 45 years to double again, adding two  billion by 1975. In only 45 years from then, 2020, we will  have doubled once again, adding not one billion, not two  billion, but four billion people. Some people alive in 2020  will have seen the world's population increase by an as­tounding  300 percent during their lifetimes. As the United  States struggles to manage its own exploding population, it  also will face new problems responding to global demands  for our resources.  People who downplay the threats ofpopulation growth  offer several arguments. Some still say that new, unspecified  technologies will save us. Others say that human labor is the  source of wealth and innovation, and so the more human  beings we have, the more wealth and creativity we wi II  enjoy. The days for such wishful thinking are over. We have  increasing evidence that we already are approaching, or  have surpassed, the earth's carrying capacity. Neither  technological ingenuity nor human productivity can over­come  the fact that the earth's resources are finite.  A Finite Resource Base  The limits to the earth's resources are most evident in our  food supplies. 1 For example, in the past we have counted on  increasing the production of two sources of protein: fish and  grain. In the past few years, the per capita production of  both world fisheries and world cereal supplies has leveled  off, and may have begun to decline. In the 1970s, the UN  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that  ocean fisheries could not sustain a yield over 100 million  tons per year. In 1989, the total fish catch, including fish  farms and inland water ways, reached that number, and it  has fluctuated between 97 and 99 million tons in the four  years since then. Because the world's population keeps  4  growing, the fish catch per person actually declined eight  percent in those four years. Recent FAO reports indicate no  excess capacity in any of the world's seventeen oceanic  fisheries.  The prospects are no better for grain. In the past, we have  gained productivity by using chemical fertilizers, irrigation,  and new genetic varieties of crops. It seems we now have  reached the point at which the marginal gains from using  more fertilizer do not justify the costs. Although it increased  steadily from 1950 to 1989, global fertilizer use has been  declining since 1989. In the U.S. it peaked early in the  1980s and has declined about ten percent in the past de­cade.  Nor is increased irrigation much of a promise. Most of  the world's best irrigable land already is in production. More  importantly, our supply of irrigation water is decreasing. In  the U.S. we are drawing down our aquifers at a rate 25  percent faster than they are recharging. Some, such as the  Ogallala aquifer, are going much faster. Meanwhile, every  year our spreading population converts about one million  acres of U.S. farmland to urbanization and roads. And our  demand continues to grow.  Standard of Living Expectations  By the year 2050, we can expect 11 billion people on the  earth. I know of no ecologist who believes we can support  that many people at our current standard of I iving. But is  that the right standard to use? Should we expect that we, let  alone the whole world, should continue to enjoy our current  standard of living? Another, perhaps more enlightened  reason offered for ignoring population growth is the idea that  we really have a consumption problem, not a population  problem. The U.S., this argument goes, consumes much  more than its share of the world's resources. If the U.S.,  Japan, and western Europe lived more rationally, spending  less money on luxury items, eating less meat and processed  foods, more resources would be available for a growing  population. We could still enjoy a high quality of life while  5  consuming less. The argument has merit. Surely, we could  reduce our consumption and stretch the world's resources.  Still, in the long run, that would only lessen the pain and  slightly postpone the day of reckoning. The problem finally  is numbers. The number of people is increasing, while the  number of resources is decreasing.  For American wilderness, the problems posed by  population growth are ecological, political, eco­nomic,  social, and technological.  The fact is, a reduction of consumption rates in the U.S.  is not a strategy. It is an inevitability. We could not sustain  our current rates of consumption even if we wanted to. The  questions are, how much will we reduce, and how fast, and  how will we will determine the answers to these questions?  If everyone in the U.S. consumed no more than the  average citizen of China, the strain on our resources cer­tainly  would be reduced. In China, on the average, 322  people occupy every square mile, while in the U.S. the  average is only 69 people per square mile. If we followed  the Chinese example, we would have room for 1.2 billion  people, a 467-percent increase over our present population.  But do we want to strive for the Chinese quality of life? We  could learn many things from that ancient nation, but the art  of cramming people into small spaces--at the expense of a  low standard of living, ecological devastation, and political  repression--probably is not something we want to emulate.  On the other hand, maybe we should study China. At our  present rate of population growth, the U.S. wi II reach  China's current population of one billion by the year 2100.  That is not so far away. Some of you here tonight may have  children alive then.  6  I could say much more about population, but this lecture  is about wilderness. The point I want to underscore is that,  short of world-wide disease, or war, or unprecedented  natural catastrophe, we cannot escape the numbers, at least  not for the next two or three generations.  Wilderness on our public land? We have a population  problem in the U.S., and it will get worse. Our population  will increase exponentially, and the consequences will be  equally dramatic. Living in the U.S. today are 260 million  people. By the year 2050, that number could well be  doubled, to 520 million people. If we want to maintain our  present national standard of living, we will need to double  our residential living space, double the capacity of our  transportation systems, double our food supply. We will  demand an accelerating flow of wood, paper, and petro­leum;  more gas stations and parking lots; more shopping  malls; and more highways. That trend will be the most  important force affecting wilderness in the U.S., and it will  be the force that drives our policies for wilderness on public  land.  Humankind's Impact on the Wilderness Environment  Most of the implications of population growth for wilder­ness  are fairly obvious. I will simply sketch them here, and  then I want to spend the rest of my time discussing what  should be done.  For American wilderness, the problems posed by popula­tion  growth are ecological, political, economic, social, and  technological. Ecologically, more people will mean a greater  demand for wilderness resources, and a greater strain on the  natural ecosystems surrounding them. Recreational use of  federal wilderness areas has been growing at a rate even  higher than our rate of population growth. Wilderness  managers already worry about the growing human impact  on popular areas. Increasingly, people are moving nearer to  natural amenities and away from urban centers. As that  7  trend continues, so will the increase in demand for wilder­ness.  Meanwhile, the land surrounding wilderness will feel  the impact as well, with more opportunities for soil erosion,  air and water pollution, and other ambient problems that  can degrade wilderness.  This information, issued in 1980, was largely ignored by  the Reagan and Bush presidential administrations. Mean­while,  both the ambient pressures and park visitation in­creased  dramatically. For many reasons, including urbaniza­tion  and increased mobility, park visitation has increased  even more rapidly than our rate of population growth. Since  1940, U.S. population has doubled, but park visitation has  increased 16 times. The previous 40-year ratio of park  visitation to population growth of 16:1, might not continue.  Let's say the ratio drops to only 4:1. Then, by 2050, our  national parks still would endure over one billion visits per  year. Unfortunately, while enjoying the great outdoors, these  visitors cause traffic jams, erode hiking trails, drop tons of  litter, dispose of human waste in streams and near trails, and  kill trees by unintentionally damaging roots while hiking.  8  Meanwhile, crime is up in our national parks, and in­creasingly  park rangers are diverted to basic police duties. In  Yosemite National Park, annual visitation has exploded from  820,000 in the 1950s to more than 3.5 million.2 Yosemite  has been designated an International Biosphere Reserve and  a World Heritage Site, but population pressure will threaten  those values.  Our national forests also are experiencing increased  visitor use. Nearly three times as many Americans visit  national forests as national parks each year. In 1993 alone,  730 million people visited national forests. But visitation is  not the only problem. The growing scarcity of resources will  increase pressures for resource extraction such as mining,  grazing, and logging. On land not designated wilderness,  wilderness values will be hard pressed to compete with  economic demands. Natural areas and semi-natural areas  that now buffer wilderness areas from human incursion will  themselves become populated and degraded, complicating  the work of wilderness managers. We already have subur­ban  subdivisions lapping up against wilderness areas. People  living in log homes surrounded by trees, located at the end  of dirt roads on ten or twenty acres, expect the same services  they enjoyed back in San Mateo. Their demands for forest  fire suppression and logging to remove fire fuels will gain  results in our democratic society.  The Impacts of Population on Wilderness Traditions  and Values  Socially, population growth will pose deep and disturb­ing  challenges to our culture. It will challenge traditions and  values that have created and sustained our unique wilder­ness  system. This is the most important threat of all. Popula­tion  growth will bring unpredictable cultural changes,  including changes in the way we treat wilderness lands. For  example, contemporary Americans experience a different  wilderness from the one experienced by Lewis and Clark.  The difference is not just that our wilderness is fragmented,  biologically diminished, and surrounded by human settle-  9  ments. We see wilderness through the lens of a different  culture, with different assumptions about the relationship  between people and nature, different assumptions about  time and space and matter and energy, even some different  values of right and wrong.  At the time they are happening, shifts in perception are  hard to predict. They grow organically, like a river, from  meandering streams of philosophy, politics, religion, tech­nology,  geography and ecology. Predicting cultural change  is risky. Still, we should ask, what will characterize Ameri­can  culture in the midst of population explosion and re­source  exhaustion? How will people perceive, and therefore  treat, wilderness?  We have some clues from real life. They indicate that if  land use is not sustainable, neither will our economy be  sustainable, nor in the long run, will our society. History has  many examples. Consider the fate of Mesopotamian and  Mayan civilizations. Whatever else went wrong, those great  cultures simply exhausted their resources and declined. But  sadly, we do not have to look to ancient civilizations. In too  many countries today, scarcity, caused largely by population  growth, has weakened traditional customs and institutions.  In Somalia, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda, families and  communities necessarily organize to meet short-term needs.  In some developing countries, families are using children for  labor more than ever before. As resources grow more  scarce, and as water and firewood sup pi ies recede farther  from home, families simply need more hands and feet. In  parts of India now, some ten-year- old children work more  hours than adult males do, tending livestock, fetching water  and firewood, and watching younger siblings.3  I am not suggesting that the U.S. will soon decline to the  level of Somalia, nor that a technologically developed  society will have the same history as a developing, rural  society. I am suggesting that these extreme examples show  10  the inevitable social disintegration that accompanies ex­treme  scarcity. Our wilderness system depends above all  else on people's willingness to take the long view, to act  responsibly toward future generations, and to give up some  personal gain for the common good. The danger is that  under the duress of population pressures, our culture will  unlearn the progress of the past hundred years. Then the  perception of wilderness as a heritage to be preserved will  fade away, as once again we see it chiefly as a resource to  be used.  A Call for Action  Now, recall the four arguments for wilderness. You can  see how population growth in the United States threatens  wild land and all its values. From no other cause than the  sheer number of us, we may lose habitat and the biological  diversity it holds. We may overtax wild land's capacity to  store water or purify water and air. We may degrade the  spiritual and psychological experience of wilderness. And  we may lose the cultural ethic that has sustained a national  wilderness system unprecedented in history.  If population growth threatens wilderness, what can we  do? Citizens and policy makers alike need to think and work  in three arenas: 1) we must reform federal land management  for ecosystem protection, 2) we must build informed, diverse  constituencies for wilderness, and J).we must confront  population issues directly and openly. I am focusing on  federal wilderness policy in these remarks, and so I will just  touch on the latter two issues.  To build an informed, diverse constituency for wilderness  we need to educate people explicitly about wilderness.  Through formal education from the earliest years, we should  expect our citizens to have at least a rudimentary under­standing  of ecosystem values and concepts. Those concepts  are central to understanding how this world works, and they  are integral to any citizen actions that might avert the com-  11  ing disaster. Informally, we also need to give people contact  with nature. We need more urban parks with more natural  features and less pavement; we need greenways connecting  downtowns to natural areas; we need clean urban rivers.  We also need to build a constituency directly, through  political and social action. This action can best be done at  the local and regional level. People can understand their  connection to their watershed, for example, and people in a  watershed should have a shared vision for their ecosystem,  what they want it to look like in fifty years, and what institu­tions  will be necessary to realize that vision. They should  understand the threats to that vision, and they should come  together to deal with those threats. That requires academic  work, political work, and communications. We need eco­logical  and economic modeling at the level of large ecosys­tems  or bioregions. We need community organizers and  forums in which people of all interests can come together to  work on problems. Included in those regional forums should  be public land managers who represent the legitimate  interest of those outside the region and those not yet born.  To work on population problems directly we need to  begin with some very heavy lifting-lifting our heads out of  the sand. We should acknowledge the problem and begin  talking about solutions. Even if 'vYe are not immediately  concerned about what happens elsewhere in the world, our  concern for wilderness right here should move us to imme­diate  action. Through schools and universities, through  local, state, and federal government, we should take action  to slow the growth of population. At each level, cultural  norms will shape what we do. That is appropriate, as long as  we acknowledge the problem and look for solutions. We  cannot pretend that problems do not exist--problems of  reproductive health, contraception, adolescent pregnancy,  over-consumption promoted by subsidies and other public  policies, and immigration. These are difficult and often  sensitive problems. I do not have the answers, but as some-  12  one who cares about wilderness, I know that we need to  address them. They will not go away, and the sooner we  deal with them, the less stressful the solutions will be.  We must consider the world our grandchildren  will inherit. We can give them hardship and  conflict, or we can bequeath to them a world  where quality of life is an appreciated norm.  A Mandate for Ecosystem Integrity  Now let us turn to public land policy. To prepare for the  population onslaught, we need above all else productive,  resilient, and diverse ecosystems. Federal policy should  focus on maintaining the integrity of our remaining natural  lands, especially those areas important for biological diver­sity.  The first step is to complete the federal wilderness  system while we still have the opportunity. The Wilderness  Society estimates that federal lands include about a hundred  million acres of road less areas that qualify for wilderness  designation. The largest portion of these lands are in Alaska,  but the lower forty-eight states also have tens of millions.  Much of it lies in Bureau of Land Management land, includ­ing  crucial land in Idaho, Utah, and New Mexico. But lands  managed by all the federal agencies include large areas of  important undesignated wilderness.  In the present political climate, designating new wilder­ness  areas will be difficult, although The Wilderness Society  intends to go all-out as opportunities present themselves.  Meanwhile, we have another important opportunity. Some  significant wild lands already have been authorized but not  added to the wilderness system. These are private inholdings  within federal lands whose acquisition has been authorized  but for which money has not been appropriated. The Land  13  and Water Conservation Fund (L&WCF) is the chief source  of money for these acquisitions. The main source of the  (L&WCF) is royalty income from off-shore oil drilling. The  original justification for the fund was that resource depletion  should pay for resource conservation. In many cases, the  most cost-effective way to manage wilderness is to buy these  inholdings rather than manage around them, but recent  administrations and congresses have not seen it that way.  About a billion dollars worth of authorized acquisitions are  waiting for money to be released from the (L&WCF).  But of course, wilderness designation and land acquisi­tion  is just the beginning. We need to focus on wilderness  management. For public land managers, that focus will  require making the preservation of biological diversity the  core of their agencies' missions. We need to revise the  legislated mandates, the organic acts, of the Forest Service,  the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, and the National Park Service. Each of those agen­cies  must embrace the goal of ecosystem integrity and  sustainability as its driving mandate.  Some members of some interest groups--including log­gers,  livestock producers, hunters, and miners--oppose such  a reorientation. They fear it will reduce their access to  resources on public lands. In general, their fears are over­blown,  but that is not the point. The point is to remember  why we value wild land. For example, to me it seems like  common sense that our wildlife refuges should be refuges for  wildlife. Yet the National Wildlife Refuge System has no law  spelling out its mission. The closest is the 1966 National  Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. That act allows  secondary uses in refuge areas as long as such uses are  ""compatible with the major purposes for which such areas  were established."" This provision has been interpreted to  allow water skiing, jet-skiing, grazing, military air exercises,  oil and gas drilling, mining, and off-road vehicle use. Studies  done by the federal General Accounting Office and the U.S.  14  Fish and Wildlife Service in 1989 and 1990 concluded that  such secondary activities occur on virtually every refuge and  are harmful to wildlife and habitat on over 60 percent of  refuges. 4 The principle is simple. Whatever else they do, our  wildlife refuges should assure high quality habitat for the full  array of wildlife native to the area, and they should accord  adequate protection to threatened or endangered species. In  other words, they should focus on ecosystem integrity.  Conserving diversity is the best way to assure the re­sources  will be here for future generations. Reduce an area's  diversity, and you impoverish it biologically. Biologically  impoverished systems require increased expenditures of  human effort and money to keep them going. The invest­ment  may take the form of irrigation, or the cost of suppress­ing  invading species, or the cost of soil loss and downstream  erosion. One cost is always present, although hidden. It is  the opportunity cost of reducing future options. A single­purpose  monoculture can meet only the needs for which it is  currently managed. A diverse ecosystem is a storehouse of  resources to meet unexpected needs. We certainly cannot  predict how an ecosystem might be useful to someone a  hundred years from now. No one would have noticed, let  alone mourned, the penicillium mold, if somehow it had  been eradicated before its medicinal value was discovered  in 1928. We reduce the odds of such benefits whenever we  homogenize an ecosystem.  Coordinating Ecosystem Management  Public land managers should give priority to ecosystem  integrity, for all the reasons I have given, and for one other  reason. Doing so would be an essential step toward coordi­nating  the actions of different agencies so that we can begin  to manage whole ecosystems rather than arbitrary parts. The  Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are  making progress in coordinating management actions on  adjacent units. Still, until the two agencies have a common  goal, coordination will be uneven. The only goal that makes  15  sense as a long-term public good is the goal of maintaining  the integrity of ecosystems over time.  We need to change our thinking about our public land.  When Lewis and Clark came over Lolo Pass into present-day  Idaho, they were intent on finding what was here to exploit.  That was the attitude that settled the great public-land states  of the American West. In those days, our economic goals  drove our behavior on the land. Now we must reverse that  priority. Ecological goals must drive our economy and all  other aspects of public policy. The reason is not that the  economy is unimportant. Exactly the reverse. If you care  about our economic future, then you should understand that  without sustainable ecosystems, we cannot have sustainable  economies.  Most of the time, official wilderness managers do not  really manage wilderness. They manage human beings so  that they leave little or no trace of their passing through  wilderness. When it comes to managing wilderness itself,  wilderness managers take a back seat to we the people. We  manage wilderness by influencing the larger system. We  decide to build a dam upstream, or to fly helicopters over  wild areas. We decide what level of particulate to allow  from cars upwind from wild areas, and how to site subdivi­sions  next to them. These and countless other decisions we  make affect wild land decisively. All Americans are de facto  wilderness managers.  Private Land and Wilderness Management  The problem does not end with public land. Ecosystems  that contain wilderness also contain private land, and  private land is where our burgeoning population will build  houses, roads, and shopping centers, drill wells and irrigate,  spread chemicals, clear forests, plant exotic plants that  crowd out native vegetation, and do all the other mischief  that our society lets property owners do. Increasingly,  actions that affect wilderness will occur, not on public  16  property, but on private land. One likely result will be the  promulgation of new land use regulations. I find it ironic that  under the banner of personal freedom, some of our elected  leaders want to relax environmental safeguards on private  land. The irony is that they are defeating the cause of per­sonal  freedom. If you do not like regulations now, wait until  twice as many people are vying for half the resources. If we  relax protection of wild land ecosystems and permit the  abuse of critical private land, that land will be less produc­tive  and less adaptable. It will be less fit to absorb the shocks  of population later. Then to shore up our ecosystems in the  midst of gathering social tensions, we will need rules and  laws more stringent than ever.  Progressive national forest supervisors, refuge managers,  and park supervisors already are reaching out to nearby  communities to collaborate on ecosystem management, but  they will need help. They will need new state and federal  policies that encourage local planning to support ecosystem  integrity. For example, we need incentives for good regional  transportation planning, or we could use technical assis­tance  for designing ecologically sound regional park and  greenway systems. Authority and programs exist that could  make both those examples a reality, but current policies do  not recognize the primary importance of ecosystem integrity  and sustainability.  America needs a diversity of kinds of land, ranging from  natural to semi-natural land, and from managed agricultural  and silviculture land to urban greenways and parks. Every­thing  I have been proposing for public land management  depends on good information and good science. Population  growth wi II force us to make decisions about how we  allocate land, and we need good science to make the right  decisions. We must consider the world our grandchildren  will inherit. We can give them hardship and conflict, or we  can bequeath to them a world where quality of I ife is an  appreciated norm.  17  Notes  1.

Wilderness Vision Questing and the Four Shields of Human Nature,Steven Foster and Meredith Little,"Lecture given jointly by Steven Foster and Meredith Little. Opening remarks by Edwin E. Krumpe principal scientist for wilderness management in the Wilderness Research Center, professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introduction by John C. Hendee director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lecture begins by introducing the School of Lost Borders, a wilderness retreat and vision quest program. The lecturer describes the need for rites of passage into adulthood in today's culture and society. In the past the context of wilderness provided a pathway into adulthood and while that still persists today there is no longer any community to witness and respect that transition. The rites of passage that the school offers draw from many different cultural traditions but they all have the same three stages: severance, threshold, and incorporation. The lecturers discus the role of the wilderness guide in these stages, defining them as midwives who assist the vision quest participants to give birth to themselves. A training process that the guides use called 'mirroring' is described, a kind of therapy that focuses on the positive aspect of the stories rather than the problems. This theraputic process is based on 'The Four Shields', a world view based on the four seasons correlating with a period of life. Summer and Fall are described as childhood and initiation, Winter and Spring as adulthood and rebirth. The vision  of these rites of passage are often very tangible rather than supernatural and the true power of the visions come from their enactment by the participant after the vision quest is over and they have returned to their regular lives. The Four Shields approach is really about balance and harmony between these stages of life and mentalities. A short video is shown. The lecture concludes with a question and answer session, some of which are included in the transcript. A list of suggested reading is given.

Krumpe  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the sixteenth in  the annual series of Wilderness Resource Distinguished  Lectureships sponsored by the University of Idaho Wilderness  Research Center. The Center's mission is to promote research and  educational activities to further our understanding of wilderness  and natural ecosystems and man's relationships to them. Our goal  is to gain knowledge that can be applied to better manage our  designated wilderness areas so that the public can enjoy sustained  use and benefits from our wilderness resources. Since its inception  in 1972, the Center has supported research projects in Idaho and  the Pacific Northwest, with over thirty studies completed just in the  last two decades.  The Center also helps sponsor five university courses, giving  students opportunity to study wilderness principles and practices  and, in the case of intern students, to gain firsthand experience in  wilderness management and research. At the national level the  Center has sponsored a national conference on wilderness  management, two national task forces, and conducted workshops  and presentations at many other national research conferences,  and has been deeply involved in several international  conferences. This past year the Center and its director have  played a pivotal role in launching an exciting new journal, the  International journal of Wilderness.  But of our long-standing education traditions, the one for which  we take most pride is the annual Wilderness Resource  Distinguished Lectureship. In what has become a fine academic  tradition, the Wilderness Research Center has sponsored and  published the lectureship to encourage constructive dialogue and  to broaden our understanding of the management and meaning of  wilderness resources. Speakers of national prominence have been  iii  invited on the basis of their contributions to the philosophical and  scientific rationale of wilderness management.  Tonight, for the very first time we have invited two people to  share in the presentation of the Distinguished Lecture. To this end  we are honored to present Dr. Steven Foster and Meredith Little  who come to share their twenty-five years of experience in  conducting vision quests and fasts, rites of passage and initiation,  and other modern versions of primitive ""eco-psychology"" in  wilderness and wildlands.  Dr. Krumpe is principal scientist for wilderness management in the  Wilderness Research Center and a professor in the Department of  Resource Recreation and Tourism.  iv  Introduction  John C. Hendee  This year's Distinguished Wilderness lecturers are the most  distinguished scholars and experienced practitioners of Wilderness  Vision Questing today. I feel a special kinship for these colleagues  because of their commitment to using wilderness to enhance the  human condition.  Meredith Little and her husband and colleague, Steven Foster,  have conducted vision quests and fasts, rites of passage and  initiation, and other modern versions of primitive ""eco­psychology,""  in wilderness for twenty-five years. Their teachers  have been nature, wise people from many ethnic groups,  indigenous and contemporary, and practical experience in leading  thousands of people through their various vision questing  programs and classes.  Steven Foster received a BA cum laude from Westmont College  (Santa Barbara) in English Literature and Psychology, and earned a  Ph.D. from the University of Washington in Humanities. He  taught English Literature at the University of Wyoming and was on  the humanities faculty at San Francisco State University. In 1971,  he left academia and took training in counseling, family therapy,  suicide prevention and crisis intervention and began wilderness  therapy work with youth-at-risk.  Meredith Little attended the University of California at Santa  Barbara and graduated from Antioch College West with a BA in  Human Responsibility. Subsequently, she attended the  Humanistic Psychology Institute and was trained in suicide  prevention, crisis intervention, family therapy, and ran a group  home for at-risk youth. She and Steven were married in 1977 and  together founded ""Rites of Passage Inc."" offering wilderness  v  therapy for at-risk youth in the San Francisco Bay area. In 1982  they moved to Big Pine, California, studied under a Paiute Indian  doctor for five years, and founded a school to train wilderness  leaders.  At their ""School of Lost Borders"" located in the Owens Valley  of California, east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and west of  Death Valley, they train leaders from all over the world in vision  fasting and questing forms of primitive eco-psychology. Their  courses emphasize experiential study with solo experiences in  nature on four planes of development: physical, psychological,  mental, and spiritual. I have had the pleasure of taking two of  their courses at the School of Lost Borders. These courses were  different, effective, and significantly expanded my wilderness  knowledge.  Steven and Meredith are authors of many articles on wilderness  therapy and several books including The Book of the Vision Quest  (Prentice Hall), The Roaring of the Sacred River(Lost Borders  Press), and are editors (with Louise Mahdi) of Betwixt and  Between: Patterns of Masculine and Feminine Initiation (Open  Court Press). Steven and Meredith have just completed a  definitive book manuscript on wilderness therapy, The Four  Shields: A Psychology of Human Nature. I am looking forward to  hearing some of the ideas in that book this evening.  john C Hendee is director of the University of Idaho Wilderness  Research Cente0 managing editor of the International journal of  Wildernes~ and former dean of the College of ForestrYt Wildlife  and Range Sciences.  vi  r.-: ··  _,_. · .... ·.  viii  WILDERNESS VISION QUESTING  AND THE FOUR SHIELDS  OF HUMAN NATURE  Steven Foster  and Meredith Little  First of all, we want to thank Dr. John Hendee and the  Wilderness Research Center for inviting us to speak here. It  reflects an openness to new ideas and new challenges in  wilderness therapeutic work. We also want to thank those  students who worked with him to bring us to this hour. We also  want to introduce Marilyn Riley, who is here tonight, the first  person we trained in this work many years ago-a dear heart and  a skilled professional.  Rites of Passage and Initiation  Steven-. Many years ago, I left college teaching because I had  something more to do than speak in a lecture hall. I left the ~~ivory  tower"" and went into the classroom of the world, drawn by the  certainty that our culture had lost traditional wilderness rites of  passage-rites that used to guarantee that the young grew up into  a stable society that provided for their orderly, nonviolent passage  into adulthood.  The community at large always played an essential role in this  process. For the most part, these traditional rites are lost to us,  although we can still see the ghost of them in high school  graduations, driver's license training, induction into the armed  services, and attainment of the magical, yet meaningless, drinking  age of 21.  We can certainly see the need for such rites in the behavior of  our young, who seek to be grown up in a thousand different  dangerous, illegal, or self-destructive ways. The same can be seen  in the behavior of many ""adults,"" who, because they never  participated in traditional rites of passage, grew up into helpless  adolescents.  At the School of Lost Borders, we seek to provide ways in  which young people-and adults-can celebrate or confirm their  attainment of new life stages in a  traditional fashion-in the  wilderness. The way we use the  wilderness, forest, or park has  been described as ""soft."" True,  we do not lead expeditions to  the tops of mountains or rocks,  or conquer rocks, rivers, or long  distances. But what we offer is  ""hard,"" difficult, and challenging  to body, psyche, mind, and spirit.  Soft? Ye~wetouchtheland  lightly, hardly leaving a trace.  We learn how to yield, to  surrender, to cooperate with and  We learn how to live  in balance with the  environment. We  utilize therapeutic  techniques that are  not problem- or goa~  orientect but ancient  means of  empowerment.  accommodate the forces of nature. We learn how to live in  balance with the environment. We utilize therapeutic techniques  that are not problem- or goal-oriented, but ancient means of  empowerment. Soft? If loneliness, solitude, hunger, and exposure  are soft, then the vision quest is soft.  Meredith What our young people are seeking is a meaningful  context in which they can be witnessed and confirmed as having  attained maturity. The wilderness provides that context, that  interface with nature that evokes truths in us that can be known in  no other way. In ancient times, people lived in the wilderness. It  2  was always there. It provided a perfect passageway for children to  leave the community and their identities as children behind. On  the other side of the passageway, they reentered their community  again, as adults.  That same wilderness is still with us. It is not entirely gone. But  what our ancestors had that we don't have is a community to  witness that passage in their life, and to listen to the story that they  brought back of how they interfaced with the earth or the 11Great  Mother."" And as they listened, the elders of the community would  see what this or that young person's role would be within the  community, so that there would be a place for that person, so that  the community would grow and survive. And the elders would  welcome that person back as an adult, no longer as a child.  In modern life, we are aware of the hunger of our young people  to grow up. Because the old initiations are gone, they seek to  initiate themselves. Again and again, we see how they test  themselves against the edge of death. The fact is, we all need to  feel that edge, especially in our adolescent years. The early  cultures taught us how to bring the young to that edge within a  meaningful, safe context. In that context the young discovered  their own unique gifts, their own way of getting through hard  times, their own way of converting darkness into light, or pain into  understanding. Members of the community played the part of  ''lay-midwives"" to this birthing into maturity.  I was talking with someone before the meeting, how when we  lose our story, our sense of purpose in life, we are in danger of  losing our life. Rites of passage in the wilderness enable people to  find their story again and to bring its meaning back into their lives.  3  The Three Stages of Vision Questing  Steven. Our teachers have been cultural anthropologists,  American Indians, and the traditions of our European ancestors.  We do not owe our allegiance to any particular tradition.  Wilderness passage rites, as taught at our school, are pan-cultural,  eclectic, and geared to the modern experience. They always  involve the same three-stage dynamic typical of ""primitive"" rites,  as first identified by the anthropologist Arnold van Gennep in his  classic Les rites de passage (1909). These stages, invariably  accompanied by certain sanctions or taboos, are vital to the  effectiveness of any passage rite. In the modern world, we must  re-learn them.  You begin with an ending-severance. The child must cut the  ties that bind him or her to childhood, parents, and community.  He or she must be prepared to enter the second phase, called the  thresholc;t marge1 or liminal state. The threshold stage is  profoundly existential and involves a passing through, a journey of  some kind, through a wilderness landscape that evokes  psychological states and feelings. This passage is considered to be  sacred. All that happens to the candidate has meaning and points  the way to the nature and quality of adult life. The third stage,  incorporation1 represents the attainment of a new life stage, a new  status within the community. This status is automatically  confirmed by virtue of the passing through.  The threshold or wilderness phase involves risk. In many cases,  the candidate brushes up against death. The reality of death,  however, is mainly ""perceived,"" as opposed to ""real,"" and is  magnified by the presence of taboos. At our school, we observe  three threshold taboos: no food (fasting), no company (aloneness),  and no shelter except a small tarp (exposure). The death is  psychological and occurs inwardly. In the threshold passage, the  child dies to childhood and comes forth as an adult. From the  passing through comes the story, which is told to a council of  ""elders"" during the incorporation phase.  4  The Role of the Vision Quest Guide  Meredith What is the role of the wilderness guide in this process  wherein youth and adults celebrate their passing through the  transitions and crises of their lives? Our role depends on what we  perceive to be the needs of modern culture. And these needs are  relative to the culture.  We've come to feel very strongly that the need today is to get  in touch with our own personal calling, values, sense of meaning,  and the understanding that within ourselves we have the  answers-that we have the ability to touch on the wisdom that's  within us and to take full responsibility for that calling. In the  wilderness solitude of the threshold time, all dead wood falls  away. Only the core is left. The person returns with that core.  Some call it ""vision.""  But not necessarily vision in some deep, mystical sense. The  vision brought back from the threshold might be that I need to go  back and tell my family how much I love them. This in itself can  be life-changing. As guides, we're not here to infuse people with  our own values or anyone else's, but to offer a basic, meaningful  context that they then can fill with their own life and value. We  witness the discovery of this value and empower them to take this  'Vision"" back to their day-to-day life.  The incorporation phase is far more difficult than the  experience in the wilderness. Vision is not vision until we are able  to take it back into our lives and live it. Our role is to make sure  that they will be safe during the time they are alone and fasting,  and to prepare them well for the risks that are present in any  wilderness experience. We must make certain these children,  who are severing from childhood, have the physical,  psychological, mental, and spiritual tools they need to complete  the ""passage."" Thus, we often refer to ourselves as ""midwives.""  We're there to facilitate the birthing-but, in fact, they give birth to  themselves. We don't judge them if they return early. We hold  them with love, are there to support them, to listen and love their  5  story, and to empower the understandings they were given about  their own way. That is, we help them understand what their story  means to the life they go back to. Their experience means little  unless it is woven into the fabric of their lives.  In ancient cultures, the community was there waiting for them  with a feast, with support, and an honoring of the new role they  took on. The visions changed the community and the roles of  other people in it.  Steven. We train people to do  this work. Our special intent is  to train elders-those who have  been through this process and  understand what it is all about,  those who are wi IIi ng to be there  for people who have just come  through, and to help the new  ones understand the meaning  of their story.  Its not like traditional  therapy, which tends to  be preoccupied with  peoples problems. We  work instead with the  ways they can deal with  and dance with their  problems.  An important training process is called ~~mirroring,"" that is, the  ability to hold up a mirror to the story that shows the positive, the  gift, the good, the beauty, the grace, the power, and the promise of  life. It's not like traditional therapy, which tends to be  preoccupied with people's problems. We work instead with the  ways they can deal with and dance with their problems. The  mirror of the elders witnesses a'nd mirrors back the beauty of the  gifts that their life has bestowed on them, gifts that enable them to  surmount their mountains.  6  The Four Shields  The mirroring process is based on a kind of ""primitive""  psychological paradigm we call the Four Shields. Two lines  intersecting at right angles. A four directions cross. With a longer  foot, we see it everywhere in our churches. Now, draw a circle  around it.  What we have here is the American  Indian, Australian Aboriginal, Anglo­Celtic,  East Indian Buddhist symbol of  the four directions, the four winds,  the four gates, the four heavens, the  four hells, the four ends of the  earth-and the four seasons. In the  If we are of this land called the North American continent, we  live, breathe, and have our very being within the compass of the  four seasons. The four seasons of nature are also the four seasons  of human nature. This cannot be otherwise.  The Summer Shield  In the summer of life, we are children in the physical body of  nature. We live in thrall to our senses, our reactive emotions, our  erotic instincts. Unthinking, unfeeling, and innocent of any  premeditated wrongdoing, we are like the body of nature itself,  subject to our survival instincts of fight, flight, or freeze. Like all  the other species, our basic function is to survive and grow, to be  born, to fluoresce, and to die in a world ruled by the basic  evolutionary laws of the survival of the fittest.  In the summer of human life, our needs are material: food,  shelter, and the goods and services that satisfy our bodily cravings.  7  Like children uninitiated into adulthood, we defend what we  possess. Our actions are guided by the need of the ego and the  physical body to survive attack. We are subject to the elemental  emotions of fear, rage, jealousy, possessiveness, and are incapable  of seeking the well-being of others. We do not take responsibility  for our actions and act without thinking. Instinctively, we play the  competitive games of survival, some of which are violent, seeking  the advantage over others.  Summer represents the first phase of a rite of passage. It is the  period during which the child is prepared to cut the ties that bind it  to childhood. Via severance, human nature is prepared to be  initiated, by the passage of fall, into the rigors of winter. In ancient  times, childhood was merely a prelude to the main theme-the  initiatory passage. The sensual, emotional, egotistical persona was  always expected to become more than a child.  At the School of Lost Borders, we teach our students how to  prepare the child of summer to enter the initiatory passage of fall.  The child (of any age) is afraid. Emotions are visceral, close to the  surface. We look into the face of a 50-year-old man and see the  boy; we look into the face of a 19-year-old and see the little girl.  We do not attempt to diminish the child, but to honor the fear of  the child. The wilderness is not the comfortable womb of home.  The wilderness cares nothing for our selfish little desires to be  comfortable, secure, or entertained.  We are always this child. We never leave this child behind,  not even when we are dying. We can no more do without this  child, and the consequences of its actions, than the great wheel of  the seasons can do without summer. The child of summer is a fact  of our nature. But it is only one part of the whole.  The Fall Shield  Mereditlr. Summer must become fall. Even so, the child must  become adolescent. The fall represents a time of constriction, a  time of inwardness, when the child of summer must symbolically  die to childhood and be reborn as an adult. It is a time of  8  initiation. The initiation must be complete if the child is to be  ready for winter, when the snows blow freezing cold, and ice grips  at the will to survive. If it were not for fall, the people would never  survive the winter. The children would never grow up into  adulthood. There would be no one to take care of the children.  To get to winter, summer must pass through the dark lands of  the fall. These lands of the fall shield are like the ""psychosphere,""  the ""morphogenetic fields"" described by Rupert Sheldrake in The  Presence of the Past. They are the memory fields of the human  psyche. The inward face of self-consciousness, feeling, and  dreams. The dreams of our ancient ancestors, the dreams of our  genes. Here we feel the eyes of our opposite sex parent turned  upon us, often with disapproval. We try to be good, to do what  those eyes tell us. But sometimes we rebel. We want to go our  own way. We want to find out who we are.  The fall shield is the threshold of initiation, where the wheat is  threshed and the chaff falls away. The bare seed is left. In  wilderness rites of passage, the tools that thresh are hunger,  isolation/seclusion, loneliness, boredom, and exposure to the  indifferent forces of nature. These are true tests of adult potential.  Although the ""adolescent"" is seemingly at risk, the risk is more  ""perceived"" than real. The experience js more psychological than  physical.  Much richness can be found in the darkness of the fall shield.  Feelings can be like quicksand, and we have to stay away from  black holes of depression, guilt, shame, regret, and grief. But we  must not try so hard to avoid this place. Here we can drink from  the springs of self-acceptance. Here we can walk in the valley of  the soul. Here we can find the will to be who we say we are.  Sometimes we wallow in old wounds, playing the helpless victim.  We refuse to grow beyond our past.  In wilderness rites, the dark shield of each adolescent is tested.  It is tested by living in it. The adolescent must live in her or his  own sphere of self-awareness. This can be intolerable at times. At  9  other times, it can be ecstatic. The student is told that the  threshold time is sacred. During this sacred time, whatever she  does is sacred. There is nothing that she can do that is not sacred.  But the concept that we ourselves are sacred, as well as profane, is  a little strange to many. People wrestle with their past, with the  child within them. Usually they find a way through the labyrinth.  And all during this time, the wilderness surrounds them. They  look into nature and see themselves reflected.  We are always that adolescent. Every time we come around to  fall, we are that adolescent we were when we were 16. And fall  always comes after summer. The child of us again has to enter the  time of experience when the leaves fall from the trees and the  nights grow colder: the time of changing, of turning, of maturing,  of reaping the fruits of summer. Every time we come around to  this dark passage again, we have to find the courage to turn and  face it.  Winter Shield  Steven: Winter is here. Who do we ask to guide us through these  perilous times? The children? They are too busy playing with their  toys. The adolescents? They are too busy being initiated. Only  the adults in the community can insure the survival of the whole.  For that reason alone the children must be severed from their  parents and put through the threshold passage. Their readiness for  adulthood must be certified and approved by the people.  The attributes of adulthood are many. They bear such names  as self-control, self-reliance, commitment, vulnerability, hard  work, order, selflessness, patience, sacrifice, endurance, empathy,  etc. The true adult recognizes the interdependence of human and  nature, and lives in accordance with the ways of the wild. The  threshold experience in the wilderness confirms that these  attributes are present in the young.  The north shield represents the mind, or what the biologist  Gregory Bateson calls umental process"" (Mind and Nature). This  mind activity is recognized throughout the universe in the  10  organization and interaction of multiple parts. The activity of the  human mind can be discerned in thought, language,  communication, science, and all the 11ologies."" Laws, institutions,  orders, and disciplines have their roots in mind.  Incorporation into adulthood is a function of the winter shield.  When the children return from the threshold trial, elders from the  community stand ready to receive them and to confer the rights,  responsibilities, and privileges of adulthood. They belong to a  greater body than their own now. They belong to the social body  on which the health of all the children depend. And although they  still retain the child of summer and the adolescent of fall, these  shields are under the governorship of the adult of winter.  Wilderness passage rites, as taught at our school, always  include the careful incorporation of those who return from the  threshold This process involves the celebration of certain  moments: re-entry into the social body, the ingestion of food,  turning away from the mountains, and the conscious acceptance  of community. Within 24 hours, a council is convened, during  which time the returnees tell their stories and the elders respond  with their ~~mirroring"" of meaning. The attainment of adulthood is  confirmed. The candidate is empowered to live a life befitting the  new life station.  11  Spring Shield  Meredith Spring brings a sense of being a part of something  greater than ourselves-a new life, a new hope, a shift in  perspective toward the light. In the spring of human nature, the old  forms of winter are broken. New life comes forth. The rite of  passage has come full circle: body (south), psyche (west), mind  (north) and spirit (east). The spirit of regeneration; the spirit of  birth, when something springs from nothing. The creative  impulse. Child becomes adolescent, becomes adult, becomes  newly born. Where is death? If death is on the great ~~wheel of the  seasons,"" it occurs here, in the northeast, where the old forms  disintegrate and the spirit begins to breathe on the seemingly dead  seed.  The constriction of the fall shield is countered now by the  expansion of the rising sun. The darkness of the initiatory passage  was necessary so that the child could become an adult, so that the  adult could be illumined. This illumination is the by-product of  the discipline. It has been earned by hard work, by virtues  encountered in the dark passage. The quester is rewarded with a  vision of the Holy Grail. She or he sees with the long view. He  sees how he can change his life. She sees how she can dance  with the divorce. He realizes he must tell his children he loves  them. Examples of sudden insight and illumination are typical.  What is Vision?  Vision is nothing if it is not attached to appropriate action.  Plenty of people return with 11Visions."" The spirit shield of spring is  oozing with the stuff to make visions. Wild nature inspires visions,  although usually they are not the kind where angels descend on  ladders of light. People tell us all kinds of stories. We listen  without judgment, but we tell them their vision means nothing  unless they can get their feet on the ground and assume the hard  work necessary to activate these visions for the benefit of the  community.  12  Common also are stories of connection with spirit, God, or  indwelling Mind. American Indians consider spirit not to be some  invisible thing living inside life forms. To them, spirit is the thing  itself, the creature, the species itself. In the wilderness, such  11Spirits"" are everywhere. Some sting, some scratch, but their  purpose is sacred. They remind us of the web of life, which is also  a spirit. At the school, we encourage our students to pray. It does  not matter to us whom they pray to. But the act of prayer, like any  act of faith, is a powerful ally in times of distress. When you are  praying alone in the wilderness, you notice that all things seem to  be praying with you. Could it be that one of the functions of the  great web of life is to pray?  Some people come to us who want nothing but spirit-we call  them 11airy fairies."" They want to wallow in the light of  illumination, but they can no more do that than spring can avoid  becoming summer. They are like children afraid of the darkness.  They don't want to talk about what's going on in their lives. They  don't want to talk about their shadows and the skeletons in their  closets. They seek the power of illumination. But the power of  illumination is nothing if it is not linked to the fearful child who is  afraid to go into the dark passage. True visions are earned in the  opposite shield, in the western passage, where loneliness and  hunger dwell.  The word 11Vision"" can be deceptive. The vision of the spring  shield must become a part of the body, the psyche, and the  rational mind. The 11Vision quest"" or ~vision fast"" is not really  about vision. It is about balance, about all four shields blending,  harmonizing, as one-the four seasons of human nature, blending  as one, even as the four seasons of nature blend into what we call  the 11year.""  Steven: Twenty years ago, a Native American teacher taught us  the basic paradigm of the four shields. What he taught us then, he  might scarcely recognile here. This simple metaphor has become  the ecopsychological foundation of our work. By passing through  wilderness rites, thousands of young people and adults have  13  helped us to enlarge the scope of it, and to make it relevant to the  modern human experience. It bears some resemblance to a  similar paradigm devised by the psychoanalyst C.G. Jung in A  Psychological Theory of Types many years ago. It also bears a  likeness to the dynamics of van Gennep's rites de passage. But  above all, it is a theory that has been tested in the experiences of  those who have gone alone into the wilderness and returned with  stories to tell.  Of course, the vision fast is only a part of the training process.  There are many other pan-cultural, traditional experiences in  wilderness settings, with therapeutic value. These initiatory-type  experiences are means of strengthening the shield structure of any  given individual. Wild nature easily lends itself to symbols and  complexes related to each of the four shields. In the stuff of nature,  the individual sees him/herself reflected. For example, our training  of wilderness therapists often includes such exercises as bodily  orientations to the earth (summer shield), night walks (fall shield),  tracking and survival arts (winter shield), and all-night vigils  culminating in sunrise (spring shield).  Meredith: Perhaps what we're really describing here is a model of  the immune system. It is human, but it is also natural. The four  shields are actual shields, protecting us from dis-ease. Notice that  the body, the basic object of healing in western medicine, is only  one of the shields. The psyche, the mind, and the spirit are also  coequal in importance. Damage to one of the shields can threaten  the whole. In other words, disease can come to the spirit, the  mind, or the psyche, and have an impact on all four, including, of  course, the body.  If the self becomes stuck in any one of the shields, then the  whole system grinds to a halt. We not only have summer in  summer, but summer in fall, summer in winter, and summer in  spring. In a healthy person, the shields go up and down fluidly,  from summer to spring and back to summer and so forth. In an  unhealthy person, the shields may continue to go up and down,  but some of the shields are shriveled and almost useless, others  14  lopsided, grotesque, or heavily weighted. Much of this imbalance  can be righted in the wilderness, through various passage  experiences. Nature does the teaching. Our job is not to be  gurus, medicine teachers, or therapists, but lay midwives who hold  a safe space for individuals to birth themselves.  ~ouTH · 5UI'-1r-1E.R..,  15  Steven. Thank you for listening so attentively. Now we would  like to show you a short clip from a video film of a youth vision  quest filmed last year in the lnyo Mountains. It's a visual  counterpart to what we have been talking about.  Selected Questions and Answers  Where does the name ""Lost Borders"" come from?  Steven: The Paiute Indians called our country, now known as  Owens Valley, the .. country of lost borders."" Mary Austin, author  of land of liU/e Rain, also wrote a book called lost Borders. We  borrowed the name from her and from our Indian neighbors.  Do you ever challenge the parents of the kids in your youth  program to go on a vision quest too?  Meredith: As a matter of fact, three of the parents of kids who  went through the program last summer are coming later this year  to participate in their own vision quest. They saw what it did to  their kids and they want to find out for themselves. We're seeing  more and more of this. Many of those who sign up for the vision  quest are children of adults who have already experienced it.  Interest in this rite of passage seems to run in families. Fathers  want their sons to do it, mothers their daughters.  In a traditional culture with rites of passage into adulthood, the  kids would not be the ones to spark their parents' interest. The  parents, having already been through these rites when they were  young, would raise their children within the tradition. The kids  would participate in the rites because their parents did.  16  Do you ever keep track of what happens to these young  people after their experience of the vision quest?  Steven: Only those who have kept track of us-a surprisingly  large number. Some of them are kids who went out with us twenty  years ago. They're no longer kids. They work, they have families.  A large number of them have gone into the natural sciences,  ecology, and the helping professions. For the most part, they seem  to be succeeding with their lives within a broad socio-economic  spectrum. Few that I can think of are actual ""losers."" I can think  of a whole lot more who are actually actively pursuing their  ""vision.""  I don't mean to be sentimental when I say that all these people  share the memory of an uncommon experience-at least in this  culture-a skin-to-skin encounter with a wilderness ecosystem  while alone and hungry. A journey through the interior landscape  of their own wilderness. What value does it have? I don't care  much for statistical measurements of experiences as priceless as  these. I prefer to think that the true value of it will be understood,  someday, when all alone we cross the threshold of the wilderness  passage of death.  Meredith: We know that when people return to their daily lives,  sooner or later they go through what we call a ""predictable  depression."" It happens like Campbell's ""monomyth."" The hero  or heroine returns with the gift, the boon, the vision, only to  encounter doubt and old habits. At that point, the ""call"" can be  refused. The hero can turn away from the work of planting the  seed. Or the hero can see this monster of depression as a  challenge, a commitment, a dangerous opportunity.  All the elders can do is to prepare them for this ""predictable  depression,"" to challenge and empower them to acknowledge that  what they learned in the wilderness is still strong within them. We  tell them it is one thing to have a vision and it is quite another to  make that understanding work. We tell them the ""predictable  17  depression"" is the ""starter button."" The time has come to act, to  make the vision work.  Steven:. The elders' council is an  invaluable opportunity to make a  difference in how at-risk youth see  their future. How many kids are  accustomed to a kind of continual  failure? Everybody's down on them  and often for good reason. They  have begun to entertain a negative  attitude about themselves. What  else can a bunch of elders do than  react positively to a scared kid living  The ldnd of therapy  that identifies the  good and empowers it  is far too rare in this  culture Surely there  is hope to be found in  our young!  alone in the dark without any food in his belly? It would seem to  be proof that the kid's got something in him/her. Why, every  parent should be proud.  The kind of therapy that identifies the good and empowers it is  far too rare in this culture. Surely there is hope to be found in our  young!  Is there a predictable time when people might want to  do this?  Meredith Yes. When they want to confirm their passage into a  new life stage. From childhood to adulthood, for example. Or at  mid-life, when a person confirms the passage from young  adulthood to older adulthood. Or from single to married, or from  married to divorced, or from childlessness to parenthood, or to  confirm the end of grieving, or to mark the beginning or end of a  significant life change.  The intent of the individual is all-important. The intent-""Why  I am doing this""-is confirmed, or validated by participation in the  rite. ""By doing this, I confirm that this is so.""  18  How hard is it to fast in the wilderness?  Steven: It is probably much more difficult to fast at home than in  the wilderness. At home, refrigerators, grocery stores, and  restaurants are close by. The temptation is strong. You're sitting at  a bus stop. The person next to you is chomping on a hamburger.  You walk through the house-apples and grapes fill a bowl on the  table. Civilized America cries 11Eatl Eat!"" on every street corner.  In the wilderness, much of the food is so natural it doesn't even  look like what we know as food. And the nearest civilized food is  far away. Therefore, the temptation is less.  Medically speaking, no noticeable harm is done to a healthy  adu It or teenager. A loss of glycogen and electrolytes, maybe a  little fat. Water intake is far more important. Our people go out  with water. In the summer, a gallon per day. The psychosomatic  effects of a three- or four-day fast in the wilderness can be strange,  but not particularly difficult to endure. Transient dizziness,  vertigo, tendencies to ~~black out,"" sensations of weakness, and  occasional nausea are typical. Boredom sets in more quickly  without the distraction of meals.  Most people report that the fasting was not the difficult part.  Rather, it was the boredom, or the loneliness, or the helpless terror  of a thunderstorm. Without food in its belly, the human psyche  11eats"" memories, sensations, emotions, feelings, thoughts,  illuminations, and prayers; it ~~eats"" the landscape, the trees and  rocks, and the insects and birds. Fasting erases the boundary  between the self and nature. The person who returns from a  wilderness fast may have a hungry body, but the soul, the mind,  and the spirit have been fed.  19  Does your work make people dependent on the wilderness?  Doesn't it make them more vulnerable to the dangers of the  city- because they can't find their strength in the  city-they have to go to the wilderness to get it?  Meredith: Ultimately, the goal of this kind of work is to help  people learn how to move back and forth between the worlds,  easily and effortlessly. In such a way, wilderness blends with  human life lived in the city. Or human life lived in the city blends  with wilderness.  Exposure to the wilderness is absolutely essential to the future  of the human race. As our wilderness areas shrink and our  atmosphere changes, we must make the right choices about which  way to go. Exposure to the wilderness for four days and nights  without food or shelter ~~puts dust back into your blood,"" as they  say. You never forget. The experience becomes a kind of  conviction. You want to have a say in what happens to the  wilderness, the environment, and the earth.  Is vision questing becoming more popular?  Steven. Do you mean the word 'Vision quest,"" or the sort of work  we do, the three-stage process involving a three- or four-day-and­night  fast alone in the wilderness? The word itself is quite popular  and will become even more so. Films, books, footwear, outdoor  gear, airplane trips to Hawaii, perfume, beer .... I shudder to think  what the capitalistic culture will do with this word. Though the  term 'Vision quest"" may become common and mundane as a  penny, the actual experience of a 11Vision quest"" will always be  rare, sacred, and deeply inviolate-at least to those who value and  learn from their experience. Incidently, the word 11Vision quest"" is  from the Latin ""sight, or thing seen"" and ""to seek, to inquire.""  Is the experience of a vision quest, as we have defined it,  becoming more popular? There is no doubt this kind of  experiential ~~inquiry"" within a wilderness setting is growing more  popular, even as the eco-psychology movement, of which it is a  20  part, reaches into classrooms everywhere. Many people are  coming to be trained. They are eager to explore ways in which  they can provide safe wilderness contexts in which individuals and  communities can experience the old way of the passage rite. As  the years pass and we enter the next century, the desire to be  alone and hungry on the earth will flourish. It may become an  extremely appropriate way for people to orient themselves,  prioritize their values, and remember why they are here. And  maybe, just maybe, there will be some who return from the  mountain of vision with answers, real answers to the challenging  questions of our times.  Suggested Reading  Bateson, Gregory.
