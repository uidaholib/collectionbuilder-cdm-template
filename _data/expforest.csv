Disposal of overdense hemlock reproduction from under a 140-year-old shelterwood of western white pine [01],K.P. Davis,"Disposal of overdense hemlock reproduction from under a 140-year-old shelterwood of western white pine, Sands Creek, Deception Creek Experimental Forest, Idaho. About 65 or 70 years ago a light ground fire evidently went through this particular area killing only a portion of the stand. The stand was opened up sufficiently, however, to let in natural reproduction in great abundance.  Although western white pine seedlings also became established, the shelterwood was too dense to permit their subsequent development and they were choked out by the more tolerant hemlock reproduction. The resultant tangle of stagnated hemlock-literally dog-hair thick-was given up as hopeless and is as shown in this view being cut out to try to get new reproduction of pine. This is an example of what can happen in partial cuttings in the western white pine type if the shelterwood is not removed in time.
