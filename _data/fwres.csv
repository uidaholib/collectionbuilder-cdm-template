Schenk2 ,3  Cone and seed insect research (C & S), conducted at the University  of Idaho since 1957, has been supported by both State and Federal funds  administered through the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences .  Fr om 1957 to 1966 C & S research was supported by SR #55 (Special Research);  from 1966 to 1967, by STAR funds (Short Term Applied Research); and from  1968 to the present by McIntire-Stennis funds. A special McIntire-Stennis  Project (M.S. 115) was funded in 1966 and 1967 .  General objectives of this research were to: (1) inventory the insect  species attacking cones and seeds of Idaho conifers; (2) identify, describe  and determine the extent of damage caused by both immature and adult insec t s;  and (3) determine ecological life histories and intra- and interspecific  relationships of the various cone and seed insects, and the more important  entomophagous species.  More specific objectives of particular projects were to: (1) evaluate  factors influencing cone and seed losses in relation to establishment and  management of seed orchards snd seed-production areas; (2)(a) correlate  fluctuations of insect populations to fluctuations of cone crops and major  1 Present address: Federal Department of Forestry Research, PMB 5054,  I badan, Western State, NIGERIA.  2Graduate assistant, former graduate assistant, and Professor, respectively,  College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, University of Idaho,  Moscow, Idaho 83843.  3pub1ished with approval of the Director, Forest, Wildlife and Range  Experiment Station, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho 83843.  1 UBAAR'f  UNNERSli'1' Or IOAHO  environmental factors, and (b) obtain a quantitative description of the  influence of fluctutations of cone crop to insect populations; (3)  relate damage and population levels to the major site factors and develop  a rating system by which individual stands can be described and compa~ed  on the basis of potential production of undamaged seed; (4) develop  direct or indirect 'inetHods of control which will cause the least dis-  ,  ruption of the ecosystem; and (5) evaluate the effectiveness of the  systemic insecticide Meta-Systox-R for the control of cone and seed insects.  This checklist presents an inventory of the cone and seed i~sect r  species collected in Idaho from 1957 to 1974 and includes 191 species  from 121 genera, 56 families, and 9 orders. Species collected by U. S.  Forest Service personnel from Ogden, Utah, are marked by an asterisk (*);  cone and seed insects collected from the University of Idaho are not marked.  Insects collected by both groups are marked with a double asterisk (**).  4  Records of the Forest Service collections were published in 1973.  The checklist is divided into two parts; the first part lists the .  cone and seed insects by host tree species, the life stage of the insect  collected (N = nymph, L = larva, P = pupa, A = adult) and the specialist  who provided the determination. The second part presents a composite  list of all the cone and seed insects along with a code (Table I) for the  host tree(s).

Bruce Godfrey, Ervin G. Schuster and William D. Kossli  21 This directory was developed as a part of a larger study- concerning  the forest products industry of Idaho. The general purpose of the study is  to determine the status and importance of this industry in Idaho .  One of the first effnrts undertaken in the study involved the identification  of firmsll who were operating during 1973. This directory is one result of  this ac tivity. The questionnaires used by Williams (4, 5) in studying the  sawmill industry in the early 1960's provided the initial list of potential  firms to be contacted . Firms listed in pllblfshed directories (1) and  directories from other agencies (2) were added to this basic list of firms.  This list of firms was mailed to the applicable extension agricultural agents  who work in Idaho's forty-four count ies. These agents added firms which they  knew existed but were not included in this list and deleted firms that they  knew to be out of business. The remaining fil~S provided the basic list of  firms that were interviewed during 1974. Other firms were added or deleted  t o the list of finns contacted whene'ler anyone knew of firms that had gone out  of business or which had not previously been identified. As a result of the  interviews conducted, we believe that this directory is the most complete and  accurate list of firms available. It is recognized, however, that some firms  -1/ A ut h Drs a re aSSOc.I ate pro f ess~r , aSs1. stant pro f essor an d researc h aSs1' stant.  llThiS research was jointly sponsored by the Intermountain Forest and Range  Experiment Station, Forest Service; the College of Forestry, Wildlife and  Range Experiment Stat ion, University of IdD.ho; and Idaho's Forest Industry.  llThis directory includes only those firms which use ""roundwood"" or trees in  some form to make or manufacture other products. Firms such as wholesalers,  loggers and forest consultants are therefo r e not included in this directory.  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO LIBRARY  are known to be no longer in business (these are indicated with an * in the  county lists) and that other fi rms began operation during 1974 and are not  included because the study emphasized production during 1973.  This directory is designed to achieve the following purposes. First,  2  land administrators, politicians and other decision makers should find the  directory of use in determining who might be affec t ed by alternative proposed  policies. Second, buyers of forest products should find the directory of use  in determi ning who might be producing products desired. Third, industry people  may find the direc tory useful in helping form possible trade associations,  cooperatives or in identifying firms who might have similar problems.  The directory is divided into four major sections. The first, printed  on red paper , i s a complete alphabetical listing of firms. The second section  (beige pages) is an alphabetical listing of all firms by county. This list  a lso contains a compl ete mailin5 addr ess fo r each firm. The products produced  and the species used by these firms is also found in this listing . This  section is the primary section that needs to be used by persons trying to  con t ac t a particular firm . The third section (blue pages) lists the firms,  by number, that produce each of the products indicated. This section must  be used with the pr evious sections to identify a particular firm. The final  s ec tion (brown pages) lists those firms tha t use the species indicated to  manufacture various produc ts.  l1li  III  II  •• III  II  II  The following codes are used throughout this directory:  Products Sold Codes  01 Rough green boards  02 Dry surfaced boards  03 Studs  04 Rough dimension lumber  05 Surfaced dimension lumber  06 Box lumber, flooring, siding  07 Moulding, cut stock  08 Poles  09 Piling  10 Posts  11 Mine Timbers  12 Railroad ties  13 Fencing  14 Shakes  15 Shingles  16 Plywood veneer  17 Pulp  18 Chips  19 Paper products  20 House logs  21 Custom cutting  22 Timbers  23 Shake bolts, shake poles  24 Other  Species Used Code  01 Douglas fir  02 Hemlock  03 True firs  04 White pine  05 Spruce  06 Ponderosa pine  07 Cedar  08 Lodgepole pine  09 Larch  10 Hardwoods  Firm Identification Number (ID)  . . .Firms are numbered consecutively in  alphabetic order (see section one).

OF IDAHO USRARY  •  •  •  II  -  •• •• •• ••  A DIRECTORY TO DISJUNCT AND ENDEMIC PLANTS  OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN IDAHO 1/  by  Robert Steele 1/  INTRODUCTION  This directory is designed to identify loca ti ons of those plants in  1.  c e ntral and southern Idaho which have restricted distributions. Some spec i es  included herein may seem Common locally ye t they exh ibit a notable degr ee  of r estriction when compared with moda l distributi ons within the State and  Pacific Northwest. Many of these species are endemic to Idaho and their  known occurrence varies from a single co llection to re lative ly large areas  within the State. Other populations occur in Idaho as disjunc t s - iso lated  from their main popu lations which may center in the Great Plains , Great  Basin, Sierra Nevada, Canada or elsewhere. Idaho has a complex floristic  and geologic history that ha s c rea t ed refugia and species isolation of  equal complexity. This directory does not pretend to summar ily define such  refu gia. It merely provides some known l ocalities where these species  occur so that those inte rested can become acquainted with the nature of  these species for their individua l pursuits.  A few species listed herein might be considered rare or enda ngered  but the directory as a whole does not constitute a l ist of rare or en -  dangered species. Even with limite d habitat, many of these species occur  in great numbers and face no foreseeable danger of extinction . For a  tenative list of rare and e ndange red plants of Idaho, the r eader should  consult Wellner and Johnson (1 974) .  17'he research reported here was supported by McIntire - Stennis Project #14  of the forest , Wildlife and Range Experiment Station, University of Idaho .  2The author is currently [iorestel', Intermountain Forest and flange Ioxperi­ment  Station , USDA forest Seroice , Boise, Tdaho .  2.  In general, this directory pertains to the portion of Idaho lying south  of the east-west axis of the Salmon River between the towns of Riggins and  North Fork. More precisely, this boundary follows the canyon rim along the  south side of the river and extends up tributaries having str ong canyon  topography (Fig. 1). This boundary also separates several physiographic  subsections (Arnold, 1975). At the head of the Little Salmon River Canyon,  this line swings nor th along the physiographic boundary between the Nor t he r n  Rocky Mountain and Columbia Intermontane provinces. Near Lucile, the line  turns southwest to the Oregon border along the boundary separating the  Wallowa-Seven Devils and Tristate Uplands physiographic sections. To the  east near the town of North Fork, this boundary swings north to Montana  along the separation of the Salmon Uplands and Open Northern Rockies sections.  This delineation attempts to separate vegetal features more character-istic  of the north from those more common southward . Much forest north of  this line includes .Thuja plicata, Pinus mo nticola, and Taxus brevifolia. • This line also approximates the southern limits of Larix lyallii, Holodiscus  discolor, and the preponderance of steppe vegetation lacking Artemisia  tridentata . In addition, this line approximates t he northern limits in  Idaho of -Pi-nu-s flex ilis.  Plant nomenclature used herein fo ll ows Hitchcock et al. (1955 - 1969 ).  This work also provided the flowering dates given, some plant locations list-ed  herein, and the geographical bases for including mos t taxa in this direct-ory.  A recent condensation of t his work (Hitchcock and Cronquist, 1973)  offers a few ta xonomic revisions that are also included. For some species,  Davis (1952) was also consulted.  The data herein are based on searches of herbaria at the University of  Idaho, Idaho State Unive r sity, Boise State Unive r sity , Wa sll in gton State  CANADA  2:  0  I-  &lt;!)  2:  I  (f)  «  ~  2:  o  0 !

University, and the Intermountain Forest and Range Experiment Station in  Boise . Obviously not all pertinent herbaria were consulted and the record  herein is not complete. However, the data included adequately meet the  intended design of this directory.  4.  In ge neral, this work was done in connection with studies of di s junct  and endemic species associated with red alder in northern Idaho (Roper, 1970;  Steele, 1971; Graf, 1974). However, recent contributions by Dr. Douglass  Henderson for Lemhi, Clark, and Custer counties have been included and are  gratefully acknowledged.  USE OF THE DIRECTORY  Where possible, plant locations relate t o towns or other landmarks  r efe renced by the Idaho Official Highway Map. Where this was i mpractical,  the locations relate to lesser known landmarks r efe renced mostly by U. S.  Forest Service maps available to the public . In most cases, the plant  locations relate t o these landmarks in t erms of direction and distance . For  instance, New Meadows -- 4W , 5\, - - Allium madidum -- 5-7 indicate s that  A. madidum was collected four miles a nd f ive miles west of New Meadows. The  mile is understood to be the unit of length used. Usua lly a road or trail  from the landmark coincides rough ly with the direc tion given and one should  as sume that the distances refer t o actual miles trave l ed. Only when no  ac cess is apparent for a given direction should air miles be considered.  When distance and direction are unknown, e ither a question mark ( ? ) will  designate a lack of more precise information or the word 'near' (abbrev ­ia  t ed nr . ) will indicate proximity to the landmark. (Table 1 pr ov ides a  li s t of ot he r abbreviations used.) The numbers fo llowing plant names  indicate the months a plant normally blooms. In the above example . Allium  madidum can be found most eas ily f r om May to July ( 5-7). The blooming  periods given apply to the species throughout its range and do not neces -  5.  sari ly pinp oint the blooming time for a particular location.  All l a ndmarks are listed under their respective counties which an:  a rrange d alpha be ti ca lly for ea s y refe rence. In s ome cases, the locality  of the plant does not occur in the same county as that list ed fo r the  landmark . HO\;ever, the landma rk listed is usually a log ical stopping  place or headqua rter s for activities directed t o that a rea .  Tab l e I. Abbreviations used in the directory.  A. E. C.

INTRODUCTION  ll1e environment of the mountain caribou CRangifer  tarandus montanus [Seton]) inhabiting the southern  Selkirk Range of British Columbia and the adjacent United  States is subject to increasing human influence. The Inter­national  Caribou Study Steering Committee I deemed it  advisable to develop guidelines for timber harvest and for  road, pipeline and powerline access and construction  within the range of this caribou population, in order to  minimize adverse effects of human activities. These guide­lines  are based upon the best judgments of knowledgeable  individuals in public and private organizations familiar  with these caribou, plus review of existing information  pertinent to this population of approximately 30 animals  (see reference list). They are intended to identify existing  I The International Caribou Study Steering Committee,  founded in 1971, is currently composed of representatives from  the British Columbia Forest Service, British Columbia Fish and  Wildlife Branch, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Forest  Service, University of Idaho, Washington State Department of  Game and West Kootenay Outdoorsmen.lts purposes are to:  1. Assist management agencies in both the United  States and Canaua in long-term planning for  the protection of the Selkirk mountain caribou  herd.  2. Develop informational materials (slides, tables,  maps, etc.) for use in educational meetings  to apprise industry, professional organizations  and the general public of the status and man­agement  of the herd.  3. Continue and extend herd dynamics studies,  including  (a) identification of vital areas of forage,  travel and calving within the range;  (b) determination of current numbers, sex  ratios and age ratios;  (c) identification of factors causing mortality  and harassment.  Contribution No. 58  and potential conflicts, not to replace the recommendations  for specific locations developed by Freddy (i 974a). These  guidelines should be revised as we acquire additional  knowledge and experience with the Selkirk caribou popu­lation.  AREAS OF EXISTING  AND POTENTIAL CONFLICT  We have mapped the areas where human activity  does, or is likely to, interfere with these caribou (Fig. I).  This sensitive zone in British Columbia is, fo r the most  part, above 1524 m (5000 ft). Areas below this elevation  in Upper Bayonne, Carolina, Summit and Monk creeks  receive persistent use and are included within the sensi­tive  zone. The presence of caribou as far north as Baldy  Mountain was confirmed by D. R. Miller in October 1975.  Within the United States, we have classified only  potential winter habitat (Freddy 1974b) as vital at this  time , since occupation has been sporadic and less predic­table  in recent years. One or more movement corridors  connecting the disjunct vital region in the eastern Selkirks  with the sensitive zone farther north have not been mapped  because we are uncertain of their exact locations. Without  this information and knowledge of calving sites for these  caribou , the vital areas as mapped must be considered  tentative.  VITAL HABITATS WITHIN SENSITIVE ZONES  A. Closed-canopied forest (United States, over  40% crown cover; Canada, Class I). Arboreal lichens  found in spruce-fir (Picea engelmannii-Abies lasiocar!,a)  forests above 1524 111 are especially critical to mountain  caribou as winter forage (Edwards and Ritcey 1960).  Cedar-hemlock (77ll/ja plicata- TSllga heterophylla) forests  above 1346 m (4500 ft) may also be used as early winter  feeding sites, movement corridors and perhaps as calving  sites. These forests provide bedding cover. particularly in  late fall, and windthrown trees provide lichen forage.  Freddy (I 974b) found that the Selkirk caribou preferred  sites with slopes of less than 35 degrees and north aspects.  t  'it  I  5mi  WN 10  Pr iest  lo~e  2  CRITICAL  MTN. CARIBOU HABITAT  - LEGEND-W  Crit ical mIn. caribou habitat  \.., COol'"", IO Mtn.  Recommendations:  I. Small clearcuts, less than 40 acres in size and  ir regular in shape. are permissible , but not  more than one-third of the original closed­ca  nopied forest should be removed from any  one drainage within the sensitive zone . Roads  to new sa les should be closed after fo rest  opera tions are completed, to preclude access  by public motor vehicles. Leave-strips at  least one and one-half times the length of the  tallest tree are essential on both sides of streams  for protective caribou cover.  2. Cedar-hem lock stands which are not used for  calving. for fa ll feeding or as travel routes can  be cut with a minimum of adverse conse­quences  to these caribou.  B. Lightl y stocked stands, both seral and mature  (United States, less than 40% crown cover; Canada,  Class 2). These forests are conside red prime caribou habitat  in the study region, paniculariy when they are inter­spersed  with lakes, bogs and fens. Most ca ribou movement  occurs through lightly stocked stands. These forests provide  the major lichen forage during the winter months and a  palatable shr ub-fo rb unde rsto ry during other seasons.  Lightly stocked stands on steep slopes with southerly  exposu res are panicularly vulnerable to fire.  Recommendations:  I . Logging should be prohibited within lightly  stocked stands of the sensitive zone , even on  those few sites where it is economically  feasible.  2. Road-building th rough lightly stocked stands  within the sensitive Zone should be limited to  those instances in which no other access to  closed-canopied stands is availab le.  3. Fire prevention should be emphasized.  C. Pennanent lakes , bogs and fens . With in the  sensitive zone , poorly drained sites adjacent to lakes, as  well as bogs (sphagnum present) and fens (sphagnum  absen t) , are used for feed ing and bedding, particularly in  late summer and fa ll .  ReCOmmeJldan'ons:  I . Lakes, bogs and fens within the sensitive  Zone should be preserved in their present  state. There should be no disturbance by  loggin g or roading within a distance of 20  chains of the peripheries of these habitats.  2. Th ere should be no further campground devel­opment  in the sensitive zone .  3  BARRIERS TO MOVEMENT  A. Highways and utility corridors_ An especially  difficult issue involves rights of way fo r highways, power  transmission lines and gas pipelines. A single corridor  through the sensitive zone would localize impacts, but  such a corridor would be too wide and busy to allow  caribou crossing. Development of a minimum number of  separate east -west corridors appears to be the only accept­able  alternative .  Recommendations:  I . 0 new permanent roads, pipelines, powerlines  or other potential barriers or disturbances  should be planned within the sensitive zone  without consultation with the state or provin­cial  wildlife and land management agencies.  2. The existing Salmo-Creston highway should not  be rerouted through the sensitive zone, as is  presently proposed. Improvement of the  exist ing highway, including construction of  snowsheds, tunnels, rumble strips and warning  signs at caribou crossing points, is preferable to  yet another barrier to caribou movement.  3. Within the sensitive zone , powerline constru c­tion  should be permitted only under the  fo llowing conditions: (a) alignment should be  located to minimize disturbance to critical  habitats as described above; (b) clearing of  rights of way should be kept to a minimum;  (c) access to towe rs outside the existing road  network, as planned in conjunction with wild­life  agenCies, should be by helicopter only; and  (d) construction activity should be limited to  the period from May to mid-October.  B. Other hazards to movement . Steep banks and  debris from right of way clearings hamper caribou move­ments.  Bridges with grid-like surfaces discourage caribou  use.  Recommendations:  I . Debris should be cleared frol11 roadsides and  righ ts of way at caribou crossing points on  British Columbia Highway 3.  2. At locations where steep banks extend for more  than 91 m (300 ft), small spurs should be  const ructed to facilitate crossing of the natural  gas pipeline right of way.  3.  4.  Protective cover should be retained or restored  at crossing points along Highway 3. Spruce  plantings along approach routes. such as those  at the highway compound on Kootenay Pass.  would provide protective cover.  In those areas where continuous access is  mandatory, bridges with solid rather than  gr id-like surfaces should be established , since  these provide eas ier movement routes for  caribou.  ACCESS  Improved access in vites poaching and harassment of  wildlife at all seasons.  Recommendations:  I . Side roads should be closed with in the sensi­tive  zone whenever possible. Access by permit  might offer a suitable alternative to complete  closure.  2.  3.  4.  The quality of roading within the sensitive zone  should be kept to minimum standards in most  instances, anticipating closure of most of the  road network.  Snowmachine travel should not be permitted  within the sensitive zone .  A public information program , enlisting the  support of all-te rrain vehicle and snowmobile  organiza tions, should be initiated to illuminate  the positive side of con trolled access within the  sensitive zone.  4  MORTALITY AND OTHER CONFLICTS  Use of a sand-salt mixture in winter maintenance of  British Columbia Highway 3 attracts caribou to the road,  increasing the danger of vehicle -caribou collision. Vehicle  collision is the major documented cause of caribou mor­tality  in recent years, although unintentional hunter kills  and poaching may cause some mortality also. There is no  evidence that predators exert a significant influence on  this caribou population (Freddy 1974b). Summer and  fall cattle grazing in the upper Priest River watershed  represents a potential conflict because of the opportunity  for disease transmission to caribou using the area (Freddy  and Erickson 1975).  Recommendations:  I. Interpretive signs should be established to  in form the public of the presence and cor,dition  of the ca ribou population in the area.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  High visibility warning signs should be installed  at suitable locations within 0 .8 km (0.5 mile) of  caribou crossing points on Highway 3 to alert  the public to the danger of caribou on the road.  Successful prosecution of persons violating  game laws protecting caribou should be given  wide publicity , as a public education tool.  The salting program in areas away from the  periphery of Highway 3, designed to keep  caribou off the highway, should be continued  and periodically evaluated as a management  tool for reducing vehicle collisions with cari­bou.  A salt distribution program should be initia ted  to discourage the use of the upper Monk Creek  drainage by range cattle.  The ramifications of joint use of range by cattle  and caribou should be in vestigated.  .. .------------------. ;c-  REFERENCES  Anderson. R.C. 1971.

WILDLIFE AND RANGE SCIENCES  Miscellaneous  Publication No. 4  MANAGEMENT  BY  COURT DECREE  William Schroeder  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO  COLLEGE OF FORESTRY, WILDLIFE AND RANGE SCIENCES  Published in cooperation with the Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station  as Contribution No. 87.  Introduction  Lawyer, philosopher, historian and teacher partially  describe the many skills and talents of Mr. William F.  Schroeder. Mr. Schroeder is a practicing lawyer with an  office and home in Vale, Oregon. He settled in Vale after  receiving his law degree from Valparaiso (Indiana) University  School of Law in 1949. His present law practice is essentially  western-wide and deals to a large extent with conflicts and  disputes involving use of the public land s.  ""Range Management - An Obituary,"" published in the  Septem ber 1965 issue of the Journal of Range Management,  along with his presentation ""Cobwebs on the Public Lands,""  in the Western Livestock Journal, August 1960, demonstrate  Mr. Schroeder's philosophical attitudes. His The Price of  Manifest Destiny, published by the University of Nevada, and  ""The Common Ground,"" Western Livestock Journal, January  1965, make. history come alive and bear down on the  thoughtful reader concerned with use and management of  the natural resources in the western states.  i  The following speech specifically illustrates Mr.  Schroeder's aptitude for stimulating thought and enhancing  the learning experience of all who will listen to or read his  message. This speech was presented to a large group of  students in the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range  Sciences at the University of Idaho on March 22, 1977.  Many students (and staff) expressed gratitude to Mr.  Schroeder for broadening their horizons as they enter  careers in the natural resources.  Lee Sharp  Dr. Lee A. Sharp is Academic Chairman, Range  Resources, College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences,  University of Idaho, Moscow.  ii  MANAGEMENT  BY  COURT DECREE  William Schroeder  ;; would like you to ask yourselves what you think you  manage. Today everyone is managing something/The  Saturday Review seems presumptuous in devoting an entire  issue to the title, ""Managing America.""! Those of you who  study natural resources assume that what you do is manage  natural resources, and I press upon you the idea that this  is not possible. It is presumptuous of man to suggest that he  is able to manage the primordial forces of nature and some­thing  called ""Iand/' or Ilwater,"" or ffwildlife."" You are not  going to manage them at all. You may know things about  them; you may acquire some special skills and expertise;  you may know how to develop production; you may know  how to expand opportunities; but you are not managing  natural resources. What you are doing is managing the use  of natural resources. That is all you can do.  I When you manage the use of natural resources, it is  pretty obvious what you manage. You are not managing  trees or grass or water; you are not managing fish or ani­mals;  you are managing people/The public administrations  I  that concern themselves with natural resources are sensitive  to t he offense of that statement. If the Bureau of Land  Management or the Forest Service or the Fish and Wildlife  Service should advertise that what they do is manage people,  they would correctly anticipate a suspicion, a barrier which  wou ld impair their acceptance. People would resent that.  So instead we hear euphemisms like ""managing game,""  ""managing grass,"" ""managing timber."" when we are not  managing these at all. It is important for all of us to know  where we are coming from, to know what we are doing;  we cannot manage anything but people.  These public administrators are very concerned about  the fact that they have had no training in what they most  need: traffic control, public sanitation and other such sub­jects.  I t is an unfortunate laughing matter that those who are  trained in pure sciences are later called upon to perform  almost totally different responsibilities. Unfortunate  things happen. See the Newsweek article called ""The  Shame of the Parks."" 2 As if there is something wrong  with the parks or the parks have something to be ashamed  of, or the trees, or the grass, or the wildlife within them  are evil. There is nothing the matter with the parks. The  problem is the people. Newsweek buries the concept in the  middle of the article, "" ... the problem is that the demands  for money, maintenance and services exceed the supply,  and in the past decade the number of visitors in national  parks has doubled to 253 million people a year."" What  will you see with 253 million people in the national parks?  This is what you will see: tires and trash in abundance and  articles written called ""The Shame of the Parks."" What  you see is a poor job of people management, but few will  tal k about the fact that it is people who are our concern.  I overemphasize the point because I wou ld like all  of you who believe you study the subject of managing  natural resources to know that what you are going to do  2  is manage use, and fundamental to this management of  use is the management of competing concerns. Managing  competing concerns is managing conflict.  We now come to the reasons why a lawyer speaks to  people interested in natural resources. Historically, the  management of conflict has been the lawyers' job and  lawyers have done a fair job of it. They understand the  idea of managing conflict as a discipline distinct from the  special areas about which conflicts exist. Although lawyers  acquire some superficial information with which to define  the competing concerns and to present in a forum the  information with which the conflict can be resolved, they  do not suppose that they are professionals in the special  area involved.  To survive in the real world, you must know how  conflict is managed. You argue this isn't your job; it is  somebody else's job. You want to clip grass, to see the  impact of climatological forces, to determine what grazing  capacity is. It is this you want to do, and to never see  another soul. Some survive like that. Most of you, however,  are going to endeavor to manage conflicts in the use of  natural resources. It is important to acquire some of the  skills necessary to do it. We look at an unwelcome tool  of resource management - the crucible in which competi­tors  air their concerns and request non-professionals in  those concerns to assign them priorities. This crucible is  what you must anticipate as you undertake to manage  the use of natural resources and make decisions affecting  them.  The crucible is the courtroom in which a judge presides.  He is either an elected judge or, in the federal courts where  most of the resource management conflicts are aired, he is  an appointed judge; or more often still, he is an administra­tive  law judge who is associated with the agencies that  3  administer natural resources. Very rarely will you be talk­ing  to a jury. You must justify your decisions before some­one  who is essentially a nonprofessional in your field and  depends upon that fact, because he doesn't want to walk  into that crucible with a predetermined point of view.  He wants to walk in and be as objective as he can in  evaluating materials that are presented. That is his job. If he  is too deeply involved in the predilections of your art or  science, he tends to be less objective and he tends to make  decisions based upon something other than the information  presented before him.  Why do we resolve conflicts in this way? There are  several reasons.  The first is a constantly growing social demand that  some court oversee the resolution of conflict. People will  not repose the process in those who work in manage­ment  and who have a particular bias. People want the  crucible to be objective or at least to strive for objectivity.  There are valid reasons to be critical of this desire. There  is an article in another issue of Newsweek, ""Too Much  Law.""3The article is about the burdens upon the courts,  the inability of the courts to undertake the volume of  litigation that is occurring in the United States today. Too  many people are too often going to this crucible to try to  resolve disputes that in earlier days would have been re­solved  differently. More were resolved on a personal level.  The article concludes, ""So long as modern life grows ever  more complex, demands on the law will increase. That  much is inevitable, and if Americans want to prevent their  system of government from being changed in a fundamental  manner, they will have to find ways in which to prevent  every buck from being passed to a judge and every problem  from being turned over to a lawyer. The U. S. has created  4  ,  • •  the most sophisticated and fairest legal process in the world,  but the burdens are becoming intolerable."" Environmental  concerns are now a very substantial source of litigation.  Another reason why this crucible is used in natural  resource management is the new style of legislation. Let  me illustrate with two acts with which you are acquainted.  One is the Taylor Grazing Act, and its first provision is  "" ... that in order to promote the highest use of the public  land pending its final disposition, the Secretary of the  I nterior is authorized in his discretion ... "" to do thus and  so. Now what does this mean? Aside from the fact that  the principle purpose of this legislation was to create a  holding pattern pending the ultimate disposition of the  public land, it is important to recognize that Congress  authorized the Secretary of the I nterior to do certain  things, authorized him to move in his discretion. He could  or need not, to suit himself. He was in power, if he chose  to exercise the power. One couldn't complain if he chose  not to. With legislation of this kind, much of the activity  with natu ral resou rces focused on fu nd ing. I f Congress  funded, something cou ld happen; the creation or extension  of administrative power by the fact of funding gradually  has evolved as a political concept. The important thing to  remember is that these agencies had the power by legislation  to not act.  Recent legislation is different. I ntroductory words  of the Federal Land Pol icy Act are, ""The Secretary shall  prepare and maintain on a continuing basis an inventory  of all public lands and their resources .. .. The Secretary  shall with public involvement and consistent with the terms  and conditions of this act develop, maintain, and when  appropriate, revise land use plans which provide by tracts  or areas for the use of the public lands."" All through the  act you see mandates. ""The Secretary shall allow an  5  opportunity for public involvement and by regulations  shall establish procedures including public hearings when  appropriate,"" and so forth. The Secretary shall do thus  and so and on a constant, continuing basis. What does this  mean? Under this kind of legislation the agency is com­manded.  The agency must act. The only question left is one  of fiscal constraints or, putting it another way, of how  much money is avai lable to do the job. However, the  courts are getting very impatient with the idea that fiscal  constraints are of overbearing significance. Congress chose  to pass an act which commands the agency to do something  and the courts are encouraging Congress to ""put money  where its mouth is.""  Recently a court did something which I think you may  find a little extreme, but it nevertheless illustrates the point.  You know what a snail darter is? It is an endangered species.  It wasn't discovered until 1973, six years after the work  began on the controversial Teleco Dam. When the fish was  found in a tributary of the Little Tennessee River, Tennessee  Valley Authority (TVA) divers tried unsuccessfully to locate  other habitats and transplant the fish into nearby streams.  This dam had been funded, plans were approved, the dam  was in construction, and then a snail darter was discovered.  A federal district judge decided it would not be reasonable  to halt a project on which so much money and effort had  been spent. Maybe even those of us who are extreme in our  desire to protect natural resources would adopt that point  of view. The case went on appeal and the appeals court  was unimpressed with that point of view. It said, ""The  welfare of an endangered species may weigh more heavily  upon the public conscience than the write-off of those  millions of dollars. ,,,, The TVA is now lobbying Congress to  grant an exception for this dam. A multimillion dollar  project has been stopped because of a species which  hadn't been discovered until after the project commenced  and was well under way, because the court said that the  6  Endangered Species Act protects habitat. The act says,  ""You will."" If you are following the situation regarding  alligators and timber wolves, the Department of the  Interior is taking a little different view!  The point that I am making is that current legislative  measures, including the Wilderness Act, the National En­vironmental  Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation  Act, the Endangered Species Act and certainly the Federal  Land Management Policy Act, are all absolute directives.  These absolute directives provide the basis with which  a concern can go into the crucible and demand conformance.  The legislative pressure for positive action is an important  reason why demands upon this crucible have enlarged.  There is a popular resentment to administrative fiat.  When a ""bureaucrat"" says something, it is immediately  suspect. Whether it is a valid resentment or an invalid  resentment is beside the point. The point is that there is  this resentment. Those of you who are involved with  natural resources must have this in your reservoir of  knowledge. If you don't know this, you are going to be  reacting inappropriately to the management of conflict.  When you as a range conservationist, district manager or  even Secretary of the Interior say ""Thus it will be"" to any­one  who has an interest in the use of the resource you are  attempting to manage, you are in trouble. You shouldn't  put it out that way. You don't handle yourself that way.  There are other ways. If you want to manage conflict ade­quately,  you have to manage it with more sophistication  than expressing absolutes and immutables.  Are there values in this crucible? I think there are a  number. The crucible forces an exposure to what are or  should be the best expressions of competing points of view.  That is another way of saying that too often those who  7  propose to manage the use of natural resources talk only  among themselves. They have a bias with respect to a  particular kind of use, a particular value system that they  haven't analyzed for a long time. They address a problem  with certain priorities already in mind . One must be careful  of these priorities. One must know his priorities and why  he has them, so that he can look critically at them when he  examines a decision that is proposed. The crucible forces  this, and this is valuable. Competing points of view are  best expressed in the crucible where people have that oppor­tunity  to hear them discussed, if not for the first time, then  more eloquently. When a resource manager looks forward  to the fact that one day he may be in the courtroom and  there examined, he will realize that he must know and  expose himself early to the best of the competing points  of view. He must be familiar with them before he walks  in so that he knows what to expect and knows the basis  upon which his own decision must survive - if it's going  to survive.  The crucible forces each competitor to critically eval­uate  his own judgment and the basis for whatever resource  decision he is making. He must do this right from the start.  He must critically examine every decision - not formal  decisions alone, but day-to-day judgments. He can't rely  on conventional wisdoms, the old stories, the mythology  of natural resources, the old priorities. He must function at  the cutting edge of the science. If he does not, he will die  from a cut in his intellectual throat.  Thinking in this way fixes a course of ac tion.  When one relates to the other disciplines that are involved  and functions at the cutting edge, he is better able to fix a  course of action that is responsible and that will survive.  This crucible has another value. I t motivates progress.  Years ago there was a range rehabilitation program born in  8  the crucible. After the event, a resource administrator in­volved  wrote ""The Contribution of Controversy to  Progress.""5 The substance of this article was the point I  am now making. This is the exciting place for science; it is  the exciting place for any kind of intellectual discipline.  Progress occurs when three or four competing points of  view - now seven under the new management act - react  and interact with one another. Controversy is not always  in the courtroom, but anticipating the courtroom focuses  the issues. A wise administrator will be ticking off these  disciplines, uses, competitions, legislated priorities and  mandates, to resolve in his mind the best way of exercising  judgment in appropriately managing the conflict. This is  how progress occurs.  How Does One Cope  -Years ago there was what I call ""paper morality.""  To some degree it still exists. Paper morality is the idea that  once you put something down on paper, it acquires respect  and acceptance. It speaks for itself. It is what Will Rogers  was laughing at when he said, ""It must be true because I read  it in the paper."" People might have accepted this at one time,  but they don't now. Neither the people within nor those  outside the science accept this. No one is content because  someone writes something or reports something or puts  statistics together. One is going to be tested - tested by  someone else's intellect - and one can no longer repose  upon the idea of paper morality. Action must be based on  substance, and if it is not based on substance, there is no  point in putting the reasons down on paper at all. The  point is that paper is more and more despised.  9  -You must avoid vacillating. There was a time when  a cowman could go to a District Manager and ask for an  extra two weeks grazing time in the fall and if the adminis­trator  felt good that morning, the cowman got the time. The  next cowman could come in and want the same thing and  not get it. Or there would be a yes-or-no decision that was  of considerable importance to an area and the administra­tor  would make it yes today and no tomorrow. Why?  Because he always wanted to smile and always wanted people  smiling at him. For the most part his science was weak, so  he found it unreliable to retreat to his science and was  willing to rely upon only his smile, his ability to get along.  This is less true today because he has been to the crucible,  and he knows that the worst thing he can do is to vacillate.  You don't make a judgment prematurely. After all the data  are accumulated, after the decision is reasonably developed  and the judgment is made, you stand by that judgment.  - Stimulate interdisciplinary approaches to the pro­blems  at hand.  -Know the regulations and require that they be written  specifically enough to guide action which can be defended  under the regulations. They should not be so general as  to permit anything and defend nothing. The old form was  to write a broad regulation that would permit the admin­istrator  to do anything he wanted to do, but this defended  nothing. He had no place to hide when he made the deci­sion.  Regulations are now more specific, so that various  actions taken under them can be defended. When you under­take  to manage the use of natural resources, look at the  relevant regulations and remember them.  How many of you have read the proposed grazing regu­lations  of the Bureau of Land Management, published last  December in the Federal Register?6 Have any of you read  the proposed mining regulations that were published in  December and January?7 You are going to get a job and you  10  are going to start administering. Do you think you are going  to administer grass? Do you think you are going to admin­ister  minerals? You are going to administer regulations, and  you must know what they are.  - Finally, you cope, in the expectation of the crucible,  by being sensitive to your power. There is in the United  States a fourth branch of government. It is the agencies.  Agency people are independent and secure, and this produces  power. The administrators have more power with respect to  the day-to-day activity of American life than people in other  branches of government. You must be sensitive to the fact  that you have that power. If you are not sensitive to it,  you are going to overrun it. If you are sensitive to it, then  you will tend to make decisions more circumspectly and if  you make them more circumspectly, you will survive.  11  ,  Notes  1 Bleckman, Barry, et al.

Adams  It is difficult to read anything about forest management or to go to any  forest-related conference these days without being faced with the terms New  Forestry, New Perspectives, Adaptive Forestry, Sustainable Forestry, or something  similar. We are in a period of intense public interest in natural resources and how  they are managed, and the public is strongly dissatisfied with some common forest  management practices. Coupled with public pressure to change how we manage  our forests is new knowledge about how forests function. Because of public  pressure and this new knowledge, significant changes are taking place--on public  as well as private forest lands. This paper reviews some of the new philosophy of  forest land management and terminology commonly used to describe new  management directions.  First, a review of some traditional forest terminology.  ""Silviculture"" is somewhat analogous to agriculture. It is commonly defined  as the theory and practice of controlling the establishment, composition, growth,  and quality of forest stands in order to achieve the objectives of management. A  shorter definition, which I prefer, is the management of forest vegetation to meet  objectives. The objectives may include the production of wood fiber, enhancement  of wildlife habitat, or the maintenance of visual quality.  Let's also review the commonly used ""harvest/regeneration"" methods. The  method of forest regeneration is so closely tied to how the mature stand is  harvested that the harvest and regeneration methods usually carry the same name.  Methods which result in even-age stands:  Even-age methods are most applicable to tree species which do not tolerate  high degrees of shade and competition from overstory vegetation (such as  ponderosa pine and western larch) .  ...... "",..~  New Forestry in the Inland NOrlhwest  Clear-cut -- essentially all trees in a stand are removed in one operation. A  new stand is established by preparing the site and by planting seedlings or  by relying on natural seeding.  An example of the c1eareut harvest/regeneration method.  Seed-tree -- retaining a few of the best mature trees (usually 5 - 10 per  acre) after removing the rest ot the mature stand to provide seed for the  new stand. After a sufficient number of seedlings have been established.  these large trees are commonly removed.  A site treated with the seed-tree harvest/regeneration method.  -2-  f  New Forestry in the Inland Northwest  Shelterwood -- Similar to the seed-tree method except that more mature  trees are retained during the harvest entry. Commonly 25 to 30 of the best  individuals of the preferred species are retained to provide seed as well as  shelter to the new stand. The shelter trees are commonly removed after  the new stand is well established.  This stand has been treated by the shelterwood barvesUregeneration method.  Methods which result in uneven-age stands:  Uneven-age methods normally favor the regeneration and growth of tree species  which do well under shade (such as western redcedar and grand fir).  Single-tree selection -- removal of individual mature trees at intervals of 10  to 20 years with the objective of obtaining natural regeneration in the  openings created. The harvest entries also include additional stand  improvement work across the entire range of tree sizes to maintain the  desired diameter distribution and species composition.  Group selection -- harvest of small groups instead of individual trees.  Harvesting groups (perhaps 3 - 10 trees) facilitates logging and also helps  to favor more shade-intolerant species.  New Terminology  It is often assumed that terms such as New Forestry. Adaptive Forestry. and  New Perspectives are nothing more than attempts to use something new and  different to catch the public's attention--or to try to convince the public that  foresters in agencies and companies have finally seen the light, that they have  -3-  New Forestry in the Inland NOrlhwest  is a good example of the group selection method.  discovered the ""new"" or ""correct"" way of managing our forests, and that now  everything will be okay. The proliferation of terms and programs is somewhat  confusing, so let's take a look at the background behind some of these terms, how  they are different, how they are the same, and what they may really mean.  New Forestry  The concept of ""New Forestry"" is commonly attributed to Dr. Jerry Franklin,  Chief Plant Ecologist for the U. S. Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Research  Station, and his research team. The phrase ""a kinder, gentler, forestry"" is also  used to describe this philosophy.  ""New Forestry,"" and the concepts proposed by Franklin, were developed  primarily in the west coast Douglas-fir region. Dr. Franklin and his fellow scientists  have conducted years of research at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in  Oregon. Their work has provided the basis for much of the kind of silviculture that  Franklin is proposing.  Franklin views ""New Forestry"" as a management approach that better  accommodates ecological values, while allowing for the extraction of commodities.  More attention is given to landscape-level strategies than has often been the case.  The effects of management are considered on a large spatial scale and for long  time intervals.  -4-  New Forestry in the Inland Not1hwest  Under New Forestry, more attention is~gl·v~;en:fcto:;:(::;:=~:::  that stand treatments can no longer be considered in isolation.  Management based on ""New Forestry"" lies between plantation-based tree  farming and total preservation.  Harvest cuts prepared according to Franklin's prescriptions include a lot of  large woody debris on the ground, a considerable number of snags, and a dozen  or more residual mature trees per acre which are planned for retention through all  or a good portion of the next rotation. It quite frankly looks "" sloppy. "" But research  is showing the value of the downed woody material to the long-term nutrient  budget, the value of snags for wildlife, and that standing green trees will be a  future source of high-quality wood and coarse woody debris.  In contrast, the predominant silvicultural system in the Douglas-fir region  has been to clearcut, prepare the site (usually by burning), and plant. This rather  simple system has been successful for dealing with mature and over-mature coastal  Douglas-fir.  However, the landscape is now dotted with artificial-looking patches of very  uniform single-species plantations. The forest no longer ""looks like a forest"" and  much of the public doesn't like that. So any system which deviates from strict  clearcut, burn, and plant plantation forestry in the Douglas-fir region is likely to be  more socially acceptable; and as Franklin's team is discovering, there are long-term  sustainability reasons for some of the alternative practices.  -5-  New Forestry in the Inland Northwest  One New Forestry strategy includes partial the mature stand, more snags to  serve as wildlife habitat, and large woody debris for long-term nutrient cycling.  According to Franklin, ""New Forestry isn't anyone thing. It's an  evolutionary way of looking at and managing forests, for both ecological and  commodity values. While it incorporates the beginnings of big picture science, it  does not eliminate any of the old tools such as clearcutting, herbicides and fire  management."" The main difference is in how these practices are applied.  Adaptive Forestry  ""Adaptive Forestry"" is the University of Idaho term for forest management,  the principal concept of which is ecosystem sustainability.  A dominant characteristic is diversity: landscape diversity from the variety  and distribution of management practices across the land and structural diversity  of canopy layers and species variety in individual forest units. Such diversity  fosters fully functional ecosystems.  The term adaptive, means forest management capable of adapting to social  changes and demands on the forest; of adapting to characteristics of the  ecosystems and sites where it is applied; of adapting to new scientific knowledge  and techniques; and of adapting to new conditions yet to be experienced, such as  global climate change, drought, fire, etc. By maintaining diverse and fully  functional ecosystems, both management and the forest can adapt and respond.  -6-  New Forestry in the Inland Northwest  New Perspectives  ""New Perspectives"" is a term being used by the U.S. Forest Service. Forest  Service leadership determined that the public, the ""landowners"" of the National  Forests, have a new set of objectives for managing ""their"" land; so an effort was  initiated to use ""New Perspectives for Managing the National Forest Systems."" This  is more a new philosophy of management than a new set of silvicultural practices.  Indeed, it is a new approach emanating from the people on the ground, almost like  a ""movement"" to reform. Determining that this new direction or new philosophy  was so new that it should not fall under any existing program, the Forest Service  established a Director for New Perspectives in the Washington, D.C., Office, and  the Regional Foresters' and Supervisors' offices around the country now include  staff with ""New Perspectives"" responsibility.  This management philosophy for the National Forests incorporates more  integration of functions--a greater use of integrated or interdisciplinary planning will  be in store.  ""New Perspectives"" is an ecosystem approach that focuses on the middle 1  ground between timber production and preservation by managing forests to provide  a greater balance of values. It is aimed at sustaining the ecosystem--instead of  sustaining the timber yield. Important aims are to maintain biological diversity and  to use a more socially sensitive approach.  There has been a lot of confusion about ""New Perspectives""--both within  and outside the Forest Service. The College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range  Sciences held a workshop in November 1990 involving about 80 federal, state,  industrial, and private people for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of  this concept and what it means in terms of future management of forest lands.  Interestingly, some of the industrial representatives felt that this management  philosophy is not something applicable only to the National Forests--that more  social and ecological sensitivity will be necessary on all ownerships.  Thus, we have ""New Forestry,"" ""New Perspectives,"" and ""Adaptive  Forestry."" Regardless of the particular emphasis, the thrust is that we cannot  continue with ""business as usual."" On the other hand, there are no really new I  silvicultural practices which are now available to solve all our problems. As  indicated earlier, ""New Perspectives"" is a management philosophy. Under a  changing philosophy we will be forced to be more innovative. We will be looking  beyond the specific stand: how does this unit fit into a larger landscape picture?  But even this concept is not new-owe have long recognized that what we do on  one unit will impact the surrounding and downstream country.  The difference, in my view, is that foresters are sensing an opportunity--and  a need--to make use of a larger ""bag of tools,"" to make better use of what we  -7-  New Forestry in the Inland Northwest  already know, to integrate new information in the decision process, and to think  on a broader ""landscape"" scale, instead of considering each forest ""stand"" as a  discrete unit. Key to the concept are increased innovation and the use of new  knowledge about how biological and physical systems work.  These are the philosophical concepts behind New Forestry and similar  adaptations. But what do they mean on the ground?  Implications of New Forestry  We will be seeing a reduction in the use of c/earcutting, and the clearcuts  that we install will be smaller. We are seeing some rather drastic changes in  management guidelines; for example, the Washington, D.C., office of the Forest  Service has issued a directive reducing by 25 percent the area harvested by  clearcutting. And here on the Palouse, the oldest ponderosa pine and western larch  will be retained on essentially all Forest Service harvest units. Thus clearcutting,  in the strictest sense, is not being practiced (personal comm., Dick Hodge, District  Ranger, Palouse Ranger District, Clearwater National Forest, Idaho).  Regardless of how we can justify clear-cutting as a viable silvicultural tool,  much of the public doesn't like it. We in forestry have been saying for years that  ""the public just doesn't understand what we are doing--that if we did a better job  of educating the public about forestry they will accept what we do."" We are now  finding that no matter how knowledgeable the public may be, they still don't like  a lot of what they see. Some of the most vocal detractors are very well educated  and quite knowledgeable of forest practices.  It's no secret that a very strong environmental movement is underway in  this country. The public's vision of what constitutes good land stewardship is  shifting. And, as anyone involved in natural resources well knows, public  sentiment and pressure greatly influence practices on private as well as public  lands. The amount of investment being put into public relations by some of the  forest industry is good evidence of this. I believe that foresters will be more and  more inclined to prescribe alternative harvest/regeneration methods whenever  possible.  Management under New Forestry will be more expensive. The alternatives  to clearcutting require greater expertise in the planning and preparation process.  Marking for cut under the systems proposed under New Forestry will require more  forestry expertise in the woods: the person with the paint gun will have to have a  lot more knowledge than in the past; the person with the paint gun should be the  best silviculturist, not seasonal help. The person doing the marking has a great  impact on what the forest looks like and how it will develop for a long time to  come.  -8-  New Forestry in the Inland Northwest  Greater use of partial cutting systems will mean that logging will require  more care and expertise--and will probably be more expensive. As we move to the  landscape approach, we will  be spreading the harvest of a  given volume over a larger  land area. This alone will  mean more up-front expense  in planning and preparation,  more movement of equipment  between settings--and less  volume removed per acre per  entry. In current seed-tree  and shelterwood units, we  like to avoid injury to residual  trees in the first entry, but  we also assume that if a seed  tree is barked or otherwise  injured, it will be ta ken out in  a few years anyway. We  have a different situation if  the leave trees are to be  retained for all or a good part  of the next 80- or 100-year  rotation.  There are, of course,  safety implications in leaving  more snags and older  residuals, as there are for  using smaller landings and  New Forestry will require more individual tree marking for narrower roads.  harvest.  There are some growth and yield implications--and we don't know all the  answers. People on the ground are asking a lot of questions about the  consequences of proposed practices.  -9-  ?  1--- --  New Forestry in the JnlDM Northwest  With New Forestry, logging in partial cuts will often be more difficult and more  expensive.  For example, pictured below is a seed-tree cut in which the leave trees are  scheduled for retention, perhaps through the next rotation . Silviculturists want to  know if retention of this overstory will inhibit establishment of regeneration, and  they want to know if the overstory will reduce growth of the regeneration that  does become established, and if so, by how much.  ~=~:;fma;;;t!ture trees may affect establishment and growth of regeneration.  -10-  New Fo1't!stry in the lniDnd Northwest  Dr. Jerry Franklin concedes that some of the New Forestry practices in  coastal Douglas-fir will probably reduce growth by 20 percent, but that they will  enhance long-term sustainability.  There is much we do not know about the long-term effects of repeated  crops of single species. Evidence in some parts of the world points to rather  drastic reduction in second and third generations of clearcut, single-species  silviculture. We do not know if this experience from other forest ecosystems is  something we need to worry about in the interior Northwest.  Woody debris -- New knowledge about the long-term importance of woody  debris will lead to changes in the way we treat slash.  New Forestry will mean changes in how we handle logging slash.  We used to think we were doing a good thing if we cleaned up the  logging slash so that the unit looked as neat as a potato patch. And it sure  made tree planting easy. Now we know that this was a mistake.  Recent research has indicated that coarse woody material on site is  very important to long-term sustainability of the system. Downed logs  provide eventual habitat for a variety of organisms; they provide erosion  protection, and are important for nutrient cycling. Some slash disposal will  still be necessary for fire protection, plantability, and movement of wildlife,  but just how much should be retained needs more research.  -11-  New Forestry in the Inland Northwest  Fragmentation -- Another change in thinking is the value of dispersing  harvest cuts.  The haphazard scatter of c1earcut units fragments the forest, degrading aesthetic values  and animal habitats. New Forestry will mean changing the distribution of harvest units  to reduce wildlife habitat impact.  We usually assumed that staggered settings dispersed the impact of  harvest cuts and was therefore desirable. This creates a lot of ""edge"" which  is good for species such as deer and elk, but species which inhabit ""interior""  parts of the forest avoid these edge areas for long distances. A series of  dispersed clearcuts may degrade a very large area. So, placement of cutting  units adjacent to existing harvest units may be preferred.  Maintenance of diversity  ""New Forestry"" approaches will supplant the simplistic results of plantation  forestry with more complex ecosystems.  Diverse forests will be better able to adapt to change, withstand  disturbances, are more sustainable, and more socially acceptable. This is not really  a new concept; we have known for a long time that diversity in species  composition is often desirable. For example, bark beetle hazard rating schemes  include species composition as one of the most important variables. We are simply  more likely to have insect epidemics in pure stands than in those with mixed  -12-  New Forestry in the Inland Northwest  species. The difference now is that we are starting to look beyond the trees--to  diversity in other parts of the plant community and diversity in the vertebrate and  even invertebrate life in the system. We are discovering that there is a lot of value  in the critters that we don't even see.  New Forestry will mean greater diversity.  No more ""business as usual""  I have seen lots of programs come and go. Government agencies in  particular seem to germinate catchy phrases and new programs. But whether  ""New Perspectives"" or ""New Forestry,"" or ""Adaptive Forestry"" are remembered  very long, I think the philosophy is going to be around for a long time. It will not  be business as usual. The public is insisting on something different. And new  knowledge about how the forests function is concurrently pushing us in a different  direction. We will not be throwing out all the old practices, but we will have to be  smarter in how we apply them and will need to add a large dose of social and  ecological sensitivity.  And, we are faced with huge gaps in our knowledge base. What are the  consequences of applying proposed new management systems? And what are the  likely implications of not altering current practices? The College of Forestry,  Wildlife and Range Sciences is embarking on a new research and demonstration  effort on the University of Idaho Experimental Forest to answer critical questions  and to demonstrate the latest concepts in sustainable forest management.

If you live on forest or rangeland  property, or are considering building there, you  are part of the growing wildland/urban illterface  - where the urban environment meets the wild.  Idaho is part of a large area of the United States  with fire-based ecosystems. Fire has been a  natural part of our ecological hi story and will  continue to be so. Wildfire can be very destruc­ti  ve, destroying homes and property and placing  firefi ghters at ri sk. Residents of the fo rested and  rangeland areas of Idaho should view wildfire  the same way res idents of the Midwest view  tornados -- a common natural phenomenon that  can devastate property and life -- and prepare  accordingly. This publication is designed to help  you implement measures to increase the chances  of saving your home, property, and may be your  life, from wildfire.  Historically, both lightning- and human­ignited  fires occurred over large land areas  almost every year. For at least 10,000 years,  Native Americans supplemented lightning-caused  fire by setting fires to encourage shrubs and  grasses to grow in the understory to attract  game, and to depri ve attacking enemies of cover.  In the latter half of the 19th century, as Native  American populations where moved on to reser­vations,  these burning practices ceased.  Early in the 20th century, federal and state  agencies began suppress ing wildfire. Suppressing  wildfire was a political response to catastrophic  events such as the 1910 burns in Idaho and  surrounding states and an effort to protect timber  va lues. This effort became increasingly effecti ve  through the 1940's and 1950's, as planes, heli-  3  copters, and other modern equipment and tech­nologies  were added to the war on fire. From  1946 to 1979, wildfires in the West were held at  low acreages through both wet and dry weather  cycles - reflecting an era when human capacity  out-paced environmental effects.  Starting in 1979, however, wildfire acres began  to grow, in spite of increasingly sophisticated  firefi ghting techniques. In 1994, this led the  National Commission on Wildfire Disasters to  conclude that it is no longer possible to hold  wildfires in check by improving the sophistica­tion  and capac ity of firefighting technology. The  paradox of wildfire control is that every success  in suppressing fire has resulted in growing fuel  suppli es.  Two types of wildfires are important to home­owners:  Surface fi res burn surface litter and plants,  shrubs, and small trees. This type of fire kills  many seedlings, but usually causes minimal  damage to mature trees and shrubs. Surface  fires can be extremely damaging in young  stands of spruce, fir, and hemlock, which have  low fire resistance. Historicall y, many forest  and range lands now occupied by interface  homes had ground fires every 5- 15 years.  Crown fi res move through the canopy of a stand,  burning from tree crown to tree crown. They  usua lly occur in dense stands, during periods  of high wind, and/or in areas with hilly terrain.  Crown fires also occur in large stands of  sagebrush, and regardless of the fuel type, can  have extremely high fl ame lengths which often  start spot fires far ahead of the fire front.  Crown fires are the most destructive wildfires,  killing mature trees and shrubs, and can move  over large areas in short periods of time.  Surface fires often become crown fires in  stands with a high percentage of spruce, fir,  and hemlock. These species' crowns often  reach the forest floor and act as a ladder for  flames to move into the forest canopy. Histori­cally,  crown fires occurred less frequently than  surface fires because freque nt surface fires  prevented small fuels from accumulating,  making it harder for flames to reach the crown  layer.  In the relatively dry, and often cold climate of  the northern Rockies, large woody debris decom­poses  slowly. After years of fire suppression,  fuels accumulate, tree density increases, less  fire-resistant, shade tolerant species such as true  firs increase, and the rate of organic decomposi­tion  declines further. This, in turn, creates  conditions for larger, more intense, and poten­tially  more destructive fires. Crown fires are  more likely since fire size and intensity increase  with the amounts of duff, litter, and woody  debris ""fue ls"" accumulated.  Although we have learned to use management  techniques such as timber harvesting and  prescribed burns to mimic fire 's role in an  ecosystem, political and social difficu lties often  limit these activities in wildland/urban interface  areas.  Figure 1. Defensible zones.  Zone 1: Moist and trim.  In zone I, low-growing  plants which resist catching  fire and provide little fuel  are used. Turf, perennial s,  groundcovers, and annuals  form a greenbelt that is  regularly watered and  maintained to eliminate dry  plant litter This zone may  contain indi vidual shrubs  and trees located at least 10  feet from the house.  Zone 2: Low and sparse.  In zone 2, slow growing,  drought-to lerant shrubs and  groundcovers are used to  keep fire near ground level.  Native vegetation can be  retained here if it is low  growing, does not  accumulate dry, fl ammable  material , and is irrigated.  4  While wildfire plays a very important role in  forest and rangeland ecology, it can be  devastating if homes, possessions, and even lives  are lost. For the past 50 years, Smokey Bear has  been saying ""Remember, only YOU can prevent  forest fires. "" But perhaps he should be saying  ""Not even you can prevent all forest fires. ""  Preparation is the best way to protect your  property against destruction by wildfire. To  begin defending your property from wildfire,  complete the home fire risk exercise on page 10.  Land!5capinq  The most effective way to increase the protection  of your home from wildfire is by creating  defensible spaces. Defensible space involves  creating concentric zones around structures, with  increasing fire resistance provided in zones  closest to structures. Plants in each zone perform  a distinct function. The transition area between  zones creates a break to slow advancing flames.  A minimum distance of 100-150 feet around  your home needs this type of comprehensive  landscaping. See Figure 1 for a description of  Zone 3: High and clean.  In zone 3, nati ve trees or  shrubs are thinned and dry  debris on the ground is  removed. This zone requires  removing overgrowth and  pruning trees every three to  fi ve years. Specimen trees  can be planted at the edge of  this zone, if well cared for.  Zone 4: Natural area.  Zone 4 is composed of  nati ve plants that are  selecti vely thinned. If  poss ib le, highly flammable  vegetation is removed and  replaced with less fire­prone  species.

Plants that ignite readily and burn intensely,  known as pyrophytes or ""fire-prone"" plants,  typically share certain characteri stics. They:  • are water-stressed.  • usually accumulate fine, twiggy, dry, or dead  material.  • have leaves and wood containing volatile  waxes, fats, terpenes, or oil s.  • are typically aromatic (crushed leaves have  strong odors).  • have gummy, res inous sap with a strong odor.  • are usually blade-leaf or needle-leaf evergreens.  • have stiff, leathery, small, or fine lacy leaves.  • may have pubescent (hair covered) leaves.  • may have loose or papery bark.  • are plants that flame (not smolder) when  preheated and ignited with a match.  ""Fire-resistive"" plants share the following  characteristics. They:  • have a high moisture content in their leaves.  • are drought-tolerant.  • have little or no seasonal accumulation of dead  vegetation.  • have a low volume of total vegetation.  • have non-resinous woody material.  • have an open, loose branching habit.  • are slow growing.  For a list of selected fire-resistive plant materials  refer to the Appendix, pages 11-13.  Landecape Maintenance  Tn maintaining defensible space, you must  L ctively reduce potential fuel accumulation by  regular pruning, mowing, raking, and removal.  The less accumulated plant debris, the slower a  fire will spread.  To modify existing vegetation to reduce wildfire  hazard:  • Clean the debris from your roof and yard  several times a year.  • Remove grassy fuels for 30 feet around all  dwellings.  • Remove highly flammable brush from around  each home for a distance of not less than 100  feet.  • Apply all known cultural practices (irrigation,  fertilization, etc.) that improve health and vigor  of trees/shrubs around homesites.  • Do not plant shrubs at the base of structures.  Where planted, they should be kept well­watered  and pruned.  • Keep tree branches at least 15 feet away from  chimneys and stove pipes, which should be  covered by screens. Tree branches should also  be kept at least 15 feet from utility lines and  roofs.  • Store firewood 30 to 100 feet from any  structure and create a defensible space around  the pile.  • Remove dead shrubs and trees.  • Thin shrubs growing 100 feet and further from  6  each house into individual plants.  • Eliminate ""ladder fuel"" configurations in  vegetation (ladder fuel refers to the growth of a  plant community structured like the rungs of a  ladder - leaves, grasses, small shrubs, large  shrubs, and trees). Removing these ""rungs""  decreases the development of destructive crown  fires.  • Reduce the probability of surface fire climbing  into tree crowns by pruning the base of the  crown 6 to 15 feet from the ground.  • Reduce lateral movement of fire between  crowns by cutting branches that span between  crowns to 10 feet, or more, apart.  • Prune all dead branches.  • When possible, keep the surrounding landscape  healthy by thinning, controlling insect and  disease problems, and reducing fuel  accumulations.  Firefighting agenciee  Fighting wildland fires is very different from  fighting fires in timbered or range areas  interspersed with homes. In most wildland/urban  interface areas of Idaho there are at least one of  four types of fire protection agencies:  City fire departments are funded by taxpayers  who live inside city limits. They have no  obligation to provide fire protection outside  their jurisdiction, and some may even be  prohibited from doing so.  Rural fire districts are usually areas close to cities  where there is sufficient improved property and  an adequate tax base to provide funding. Rural  fire districts protect year around and are  equipped to fight structure fires. The response  time can be slower than with city fire  departments. Neighboring landowners often join  together and form a rural volunteer fire  protection district. If you live in a rural area and  do not have a rural fire protection district, you  may find it difficult to get insurance. To start  one in your area, contact a local rural  development agency (e.g., a Resource  Conservation and Development Council).  State forestry departments are wildland fire  protection agencies. These agencies are neither  responsible for, nor equipped to, fight  structural fires. Their primary function is to  prevent and extinguish wildland fires. State  forestry departments are typically geared up for  action during the summer fire season and  provide less protection during the rest of the  year. Response time is also slower, sometimes  taking up to a half hour.  Federal land agencies, such as the USDA Forest  Service and the USDI Bureau of Land  Management, are also spending more time  fighting interface fires. Cooperation with city  and rural fire departments is increasing, with  common communication and organizational  structures being adopted and interagency teams  suppressing wildland/urban interface fires.  Roade, acceee, and eiqne  Vehicles from fire fighting agencies must have  adequate access to your property.  Otherwise, they may skip your property to  protect homes that are more easily accessed and  defensible.  Your property should be clearly marked with a  nonflammable sign with numbers and letters at  least 4 inches high on a contrasting background.  You should have two ways to access your  property in the event that one route is threatened.  Roads should be wide enough for two-way  traffic, and vegetation should be cleared 10 feet  from along roadsides and driveways. If a two­way  road is not possible, turnouts should be  constructed.  Fire equipment has difficulty negotiating  excessively steep (greater than 12%) or sharp  roads. Bridges should be strong enough to  support fire equipment and the water they carry  (at least 34,000 pounds) and be identified as  being so. If access to your site leads to a cul-de­sac,  an adequate turnaround radius is needed. A  minimum of 50 feet is suggested.  7  Emerqency water euppliee  Do you have enough water to fight a fire? If  not, consider developing an emergency  water supply, such as an additional well, a pond,  cistern, swimming pool, or tank. You should  have 25,000 gallons of water available for  emergency backup. Make sure water supplies are  clearly marked and accessible to fire trucks.  Firefighters usually need at least 16 feet to access  a water source. If you depend on a well for your  water supply, get a backup, gas-powered  generator to provide power to the pump in the  event of losing electrical service.  8uildinq materiale  I f you have not built yet, try to place structures  on flat ground. Fires burn up hill more rapidly  than down or across a flat. A void draws, as they  can serve as a chimney, creating more intense  fires that spread rapidly with uphill drafts.  Use fire resi stant materials to build or to replace  flammable materials. Tile or fiberglass roofing  materials and brick or stucco walls are the most  fire resistant. Untreated or poorly treated wood  shake shingles are the least fire resistant. Line  the undersides of decks and porches with a  nonflammable material. Double pane windows  and protective shutters or fire-resistant window  treatments (blinds, drapes) will help insulate the  inside of your house from the heat of a fire,  lessening the chance of the interior becoming  overheated and igniting. Make sure your  chimneys are screened and have covers  constructed for any openings in the attic and  basement.  If possible, have power lines buried to protect  them from fire and prevent the ignition of  vegetation. If burying lines is not possible,  contact your power company to make sure trees  and branches are trimmed to to 15 feet away  from lines.  Fire !3afe in!3ide  The inside of your home should also be fire­safe.  • Know your fire protection district; post their  number by all telephones.  • Install smoke detectors and replace the batteries  twice a year. A good time to do this is when  you change the clocks in the spring and fall.  • An indoor sprinkler system is a very effective  fire protection device.  • Locate several fire extinguishers throughout the  house and garage. Have them serviced yearly to  make sure they are fu lly charged. Know how  they work, as some are formulated differently  for electrical, wood, or other types of fires. The  basement, kitchen, laundry area, and near wood  stoves and fireplaces are good locations.  • If you have a wood stove or fireplace, maintain  it. Clean the chimney before cold weather sets  in, and again as needed throughout the cold  months as creosote builds up. The free use of a  chimney brush is often available from your  local fire department.  • Establi sh an escape plan and practice fire drills  with your family.  • Place all of your important documents and  va luables in a fire-safe box and keep it in an  accessible location.  • If you have neighbors, pre-plan an emergency  community fire procedure and an alert system.  • Prepare a fire kit. Include three days food and  water, a shovel, rake, hoe, bucket, sprinkler,  hose, a ladder long enough to reach the roof,  and protective clothing such as goggles, gloves,  a long-s leeved shirt, pants, and boots.  When a wildfire threaten!3  In the event of a wildfire, call 91 1 or your fire  protection district. Consider the steps necessary  in the event of an evacuation. Put your valuables  and pets in the car, park in the direction you will  escape, and leave the key in the ignition. If there  8  is time, you can take the following steps to  increase your fire protection.  • Close the house and disconnect e lectric garage  door openers.  • Cover attic and basement vents.  • Fill all available containers with water.  • Place a ladder to the roof opposite the  approaching fire and put a sprinkler on the roof.  • Get the emergency generator ready to run the  pump in the well.  • Shut off the gas supply.  • Turn on all indoor and outdoor lights to make  your house easier for firefighters to find in the  dark.  • Take down flammable window treatments;  close nonflammable window treatments such as  metal blinds.  • Arrange temporary housing at the home of a  friend or relative who is outside the threatened  area.  Afterafire  Check for and mop up any hot-spots in your  yard and on the roof. Burned areas should be  monitored for 12 hours to make sure the fire is out  and danger is past.  Life on the urban-wildland interface is  enjoyable, but not without danger. [n western  forest environments, wildfire should be  anticipated and planned for, not unexpected and  dismissed. Some counties may have ordinances  addressing defensible spaces and water storage  which may vary from the information presented in  this publication. Check with your local planing  and zoning department for further information on  local ordinances. Taking precautions to protect  your property wi ll increase your chances of  escaping serious damage and death from wildfire.

THERE ARE NO FIRE  RESISTANT PLANT MATERIALS. Landscape maintenance is far more important in landscaping  for fire prevention than the selection of fire-resisti ve versus pyrophytic plant materi als. This list is not  all-inclusive. For example, there are over 100 genera of herbaceous perenni als, many that would fit  the criteria for fire-res isti veness that are not li sted here. When planning your landscape, use the  characteri stics of fire-resisti ve and pyrophytic plants along with site characteri stics such as slope,  aspect, hardiness zone, and amount of precipitation to choose plant materials suitable for your site.

The impacts of the worsening Asian financial  crisis, which caused a sharp drop in lumber prices  in the last half of 1997, caused prices to weaken  further in 1998 despite record levels of u.s.  consumption (Figure 1).  Reduced global demand has caused worldwide  producers to target U.s. markets. In 1998 U.s.  exports of wood products decreased sharply and  imports increased, leading to large volumes on the  u.s. market and lower prices.  The Asian financial problems also further  weakened the Canadian dollar, which enhanced the  competitive position of Canadian producers.

The decrease was due to both deteriorating market  conditions and continued declines in federal  timber offerings which resulted in mill closures,  curtailments, and industry restructuring. Idaho's  sales value of primary wood and paper products in  1998 was an estimated $1.56 billion, down from  $1.63 billion in 1997 (Figure 3). Lumber produc­tion  should be down slightly from 1,859 MMBF in  1997 to about 1,800 MMBF in 1998 (Figure 4).  OUUOOk  The last half of 1998 brought a number of  announced mill closures.

The U.S. economy is expected to slow in 1999,  especially housing construction, which is expected  to decrease from the very high levels of 1998.  However, consumption should remain high by  historic standards. The Asian economic problems  have lasted longer than expected, but many  experts believe these problems may be coming to a  close. With the baseline forecast of gradually  improving global economies, product prices should  begin to slowly increase.  The global situation does pose some significant  risks for Idaho producers. According to WEFA -  Inc., one of the nation's leading economic  forecasting groups, there is a significant chance-  30 percent-that a global recession will occur.  This would put the United States into a recession,  with a 5 percent chance that the recession would  be severe. This could set up a situation for the  forest products industry similar to the 1980-1 982  recession when mills faced low prices and had  timber under contract that they could not afford  to harvest. Severe recession conditions idled 40  percent of milling capacity in Idaho in 1982.

Idaho's Wood Products Industrv II  When the global economy Tecovers, we expect a  return to historically high product prices. Timber  availability remains a key long-term concern;  with the expiration of the salvage rider and  weaker markets, the national forest sale program  in 1998 dropped by 25 percent from 1996 and  1997 levels (Figures 5). Low national forest timber  sales during 1998 will almost certainly mean  continued decreases in harvest levels during 1999  and 2000. Nonfederal timberlands are being  harvested at near or above long-term sustainable  levels and large increases cannot be expected. The  level of harvest from federal lands will be an  important determinant of the size of Idaho's forest  products industry.  During the first half of the 1990s, Idilho's  federal timber sale program declined by about 70  percent, from about 71 0 million board feet per  year in the last years of the 1980s to under 200  million board feet in 1994 (Figure 5). The 1996  sale program rose to approximately 325 million  board feet under the now expired salvage rider. The  fiscal 1998 sale has fallen to 207 MMBF.  The estimated 1998 harvest of 220 MMBF from  national forests in Idaho would be the lowest in  50 years (Figure 6). Future availability of federal  timber is very uncertain, and without timber from  the national forests, Idaho's forest products  industry could decline by 15-20 percent.  As we look to the future it is by no means  certain that the federal harvest will continue to  decline. Threatened and endangered species and  other resource considerations, a cumbersome legal  and administrative framework, unclear and  sometimes conflicting directions from the political  arena and the public have and will tend to lower  federal timber harvest. However, the need to  undertake active management to improve forest  ecosystem health, reduce the threat of cata­strophic  fire, and restore forest stands to historic  stocking levels and species composition could lead  to increased timber harvest.  One thing is certain however. The direct  outcome of any continuing decline in federal  harvests will be higher log and lumber prices,  greater price volatility, and a declining quality of  the overall raw material mix. The general market  response to these factors will be an increase in the  use of substitute products for solid wood. For  example, composite wood products, light-steel  framing, and petroleum-based products such as  vinyl siding and windows have all experienced  increased market share relative to solid wood  products in the residential construction market.  Further growth in these markets can be expected  as federal timberland availability declines. Idaho  wood products companies that have traditionally  relied on federal timberlands as their raw material  source will therefore have to make strategic  choices regarding changes in their product mix,  capital expenditures, and marketing strategies as  they adapt to supply constraint.

With a stronger than expected  U.S. economy and modest improvements in the  global economy, wood and paper product prices  increased dramatically during the first half of  1999. In July 1999, lumber prices were near  record levels and 40 percent higher than in July  1998. Lumber and plywood markets remained  extremely volatile, and in late July prices turned  sharply downward and fell steadily into October  before rebounding in November and December. On  ba lance however, lumber and plywood prices were  10 to 20 percent higher in 1999 tha n in 1998.  1999 Emplovment Production, Sales  Because of higher prices, sales value of primary  wood and paper products in 1999 was an  Figure 1  NaUnwlde elmPlsltelUllber Prices  MintblV,19911-1999  Price per  thousand board  feet lumber tally  550  500  450  400  350  300  250  200  150 Ww~~~~~~~~~~~~~ww  '90 '91 '92 '93 '94 '95 '96 '97 '98 '99  Month and year  Source: Random Length Publications.  estimated $1.66 billion-up from $ 1.56 bill ion in  1998 (Figu re 2 ). Employment in 1999 was  estimated at 19,750 workers, down slightly from  the 19,850 workers in 1998 (Figure 3). The small  decline in employment is probably due to several  sawmill closures offset by the implementation of  new technology at a number of mills. Despite  some mill closures, 1999 lumber production may  actually be up slightly from 1,908 MMBF in 1998  (Figure 4). The increase is due to capital expendi­tures  that have improved lumber-recovery and  production capabilities, especially from smaller  diameter timber.  OuUook  A majority of Idaho's lumber and plywood  producers expect slightly lower, but more stable,  prices in 2000. Producers anticipate lower prices  because of the somewhat lower levels of U.S .  housing starts.

Other Idaho wood products manufacturers  believe prices will be equal to or slightly higher  than 1999 because of a continued strong domestic  economy and improving global economic condi­tions.  The recently announced merger of the  Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad with  Canadian National Rail would open additional  north-south shipping routes for Canadian forest  products, which could result in increased competi­tion  in the U.S. market.  Even with a slightly weaker U.s. economy and  the potential for increased Canadian competition,  prices should remain strong by historic standards  with timber availability the major concern of  Idaho's primary forest products industry, particu­larly  in southern Idaho.  In the last decade, Idaho's timber harvest  declined by about 30 percent due almost entirely  to reductions on the national fo rests. During the  first half of the 1990s, the federal timber sale  program declined by about 70 percent, from about  710 million board feet (MMBF) in 1989 to under  200 MMBF in 1994. The 1996 program rose to  approximately 325 MMBF under the now expired  ""salvage rider.""

Idaho's Forest Products Industrv II  and timber sales from Idaho national forests fell  to 11 1 MMBF in fiscal 1999, the lowest level  since at least the 1940s (Figures 5 and 6).  These low levels contrast with an estimated 2.4  billion board feet of net annual growth of sawtim­ber  on national forest lands. The decline in harvest  has been due to threatened and endangered species  protection, litigation and appeals, cumulative  impacts of past harvest practices, and U.S. Forest  Service budget levels.  Harvest from the other major ownerships­private  lands and those managed by the Idaho  Department of Lands (IDL)-have changed very  little over the past decade and now supply over 80  percent of the harvest. As we look to the future, it  is by no means certain whether harvest levels  from these ownerships will increase or decrease.  Private lands in parts of the state have been  harvested above net annual growth, and it is  unclear how long current harvest levels can be  maintained. IDL is reviewing planned harvest  levels on the Clearwater area-one of its major  timber-producing districts-and may make  adjustments. Legislatively-mandated changes In  expected return on timber capital could influence  IDCs harvest policies during the year 2000. How  these changes will affect harvest levels is indeter­minate  at this time, but certainly warrants  monitoring over the next several years.  Although dependency on national forest tinlber  has declined, these lands still provide over 15  percent of the raw material to Idaho's forest  products industry. Looking at the near term,  issues such as threatened and endangered species,  a burdensome legal and administrative frame­work,  and disruption of existing and proposed  sales due to the roadless area review, make it  likely that harvest levels will decline further in the  year 2000. This will lead to increased pressure on  other ownerships and potentially to additional  mill closures.  On the other hand, the perceived need among a  growing number of key national forest stakehold­ers  to undertake active management to improve  forest ecosystem health could eventually lead to  increased timber harvests from Idaho national  forests relative to the recent past.

Anti-Quality Factors in Rangeland and Pastureland Forages,"The goal of this publication is to review major anti-quality factors that influence livestock production on range and pasture lands.  Anti-quality components of forages are quite simply any factor inherent in forage that limits the ability of a grazing animal to reach its potential for growth and reproduction.  There are a number of frequently encountered effects of anti-quality factors such s bloat, mineral disorders, nitrate toxicity, poisonings from plant toxins such as glycosides or alkaloids, neurological effects, photosensitization, and disorders associated with microorganisms and insects.  Lignin, tannins, thorns, and spatial arrangements of plants are also considered anti-quality attributes because they reduce intake or digestibility.  This management bulletin is the outgrowth of a symposium on anti-quality attributes of rangeland and pastureland forages presented at the 1999 joint meeting of the American Forage and Grassland Council (AFGC) and the society for Range Management (SRM).",,"Launchbaugh, K.L.",2001-07-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Station Bulletin 73,"Idaho QH76.5 I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/",Natural Resources Conservation Service; U.S. Department of Agriculture;,uifwre-sb73,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Idaho's Forest Products Industrv D  Idaho's Forest Products Industry:  Current Conditions and Forecast, 2001  Operaling Condilions  After relatively high prices during the first  two months of the year, lumber prices fell  sharply in mid-March and remained low for  the rest of 2000 (Figure 1). Declining prices  were due to a combination of factors,  including  • High production brought on by increased  worldwide milling capacity and unfulfilled  strong market expectations at the start of  the year. Lumber inventories rose, and  prices fell.  • Higher interest rates and a weaker U.S.  economy.  • A strong U.S. dollar and weakness in a  number of overseas economies, which  encouraged lumber imports.  ngure 1  Nallonwlde Compos""e lumber Prices  Monthly. 1990-2000  Price per  thousand board  feet lumber tally  550  500  450  400  350  300  200  150 .,::t~ ~=,',:::,:"","":,:,!!"",,""!!!!illl!!l!!:""!I!,,""!!!I!~'!I=-:::::-:::::--:::::-,'~!!!""!

Estimated forest industry employment was  17,~a decrease of about 900 workers  from 1999 (Figure 3). The Idaho Department  of Labor estimated about 1,150 workers in  the forest products industry were idled for at  least half of the summer due primarily to  poor markets but also to some restrictions in  logging activities because of extreme wildfire  danger. Though many of dlese workers  returned to work by late August, some firms,  such as the Potlatch jaype plywood mill in  Pierce and dle Crown Pacific sawmill in  Coeur d'Alene, closed indefmitely.

Plywood  production also decreased , falling nearly 20  pe rcent from just under 500 million square  feet (MMSF) in 1999 to approximately 400  MMSF in 2000.  Outlook  Despite Federal Reserve decreases in  interest rates during the first quarter, the re  is unlikely to be a dramatic rebound in  markets in 2001 unless the Fede ral Reserve  further decreases interest rates and/ or  international economic conditions improve  substantially, The expiration of the  Canadian-U,S, Softwood Lumber Agreement  in 2001 will likely increase domestic lumber  supply in the near term and place  downward pressure on softwood lumber  prices.

In fact, Boise Cascade Corporation has  announced its Idaho lumber and plywood  operations will close permanently on May  31, 2001 , due primarily to precipitous drops  in national forest timber offerings. The  closure of its Emmett and Cascade mills in  southern Idaho will have dramatic impacts  on local economies and demands for  sawtimbe r. It is expected that stumpage  prices in southern Idaho will decline  substantially, impacting both state and  private landowne rs.  Besides timber availability and low  product prices, a major concern of the  industry is ene rgy costs. Electricity rates are  high and threatening to increase as demand  -  continues to increase. Natural gas prices  are expected to climb as much as 50  pe rcent. Transportation and logging costs  are being driven up by the high price of  oil. Higher operating costs coupled with  low lumber prices are a dangerous mix,  and it is not anticipated that either situation  will be rectified in the near future .  Production and employment levels in  Idaho's forest products industry will most  likely decline further in 2001.  Longe r-term markets are expected to  improve, and it is possible that reducing  the risk of future catastrophic fires through  aggressive forest restoration programs  could lead to a longer-term increase in  available timber.

Idaho's Foresl Producls InduSlry D  Idaho's Forest Products Industry:  Current Conditions and Forecast, 2004  Operallng Condilions In Idaho  Though wood product prices remained historically low for  the first six months of 2003, the later half of the year saw  substantial increases in lumber and plywood prices (Figure  I ). A number of factors contributed to the price increases,  including:  • Domestic lumber consumption remained high, and low  mortgage rates encouraged both builders and buyers;  • Lumber imports decreased due in part to a weaker U .S.  doUar;  • The demand for lumber and wood products increased  in a number of other countries, especially Japan;  • Mills in British Columbia curtailed production due to  severe forest fires;  • Heavy rain in the southeastern U.S. reduced log  availability in that region; and  • The federal government ordered wood products for  reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and [raq.  Idaho Industry Sales, Employmenl,  Producllon lor 2003  The estimated sales value ofIdaho's primary wood and  paper products for 2003 was $1 .69 billion, almost identical to  the revised 2002 sales (Figure 2). The wood and paper  products industry in Idaho employed about 16,000 workers  in 2003, a slight decrease from the 16,400 employed in 2002  (Figure 3).  Estimated lumber production in Idaho for 2003 was  approximately 2 billion board feet, up about 5 percent from  1.91 billion board feet in 2002 , despite the permanent  closure of a major sawmill in April of 2003. This increase in  production was due primarily to capital investments, which  resulted in increased recovery per unit of log input as well as  increased shifts at some mills.  Recently, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation finali zed the sale  of its Idaho sawmills. Two of the three mills are expected to  continue operation , while Louisiana-Pacific Corporation will  remove the milling equipment from the third site in Bonner's  Figure 1  Dollars per  thousand board  feet lumber tally  500  Nallonwlde Composlle Lumber Prices  Monlhly. 1990-2003  Source: Random  Length Publications.  400 ~-------4~~~---4L--1----i;----1L-------  200~~-------------------------------------  100t----------------------------------------  Year  .' ,  Source: Bureau of  Business and  Economic Research,  The Universiry of  Monrana-Missoula;  WcS{crn Wood  Products Association.

The new owners have indicated that  they will examine economic development  opportunities for that site.  Results from an annual survey conducted  as part of this outlook indicate that only 22  percent of firms reported curtailments in  2003 vs. 40 percent in 2002. The number of  plants that invested in major capital expendi­tures  was up to 54 percent in 2003 from the  45 percent reported in 2002.  Figure 4 shows that timber harvest (bf  Scribner scale) and lumber production (bf  mill tally) were roughly equal trom 1947 to  1983. After tl1at time, timber harvest began  to decline while lumber production contin ­ued  to increase . This was likely due to several  factors. One factor was improvement in  sawmill efficiency, In the mid 1980's,  Idaho's sawmills started to incorporate  quality control and size-control practices,  improved sawblade technology, and comput­erized  process control. A second factor was  that Idaho's plywood industry began to  decline, and a higher proportion of harvested  timber made its' way to Idaho sawmills.  Both of these factors led to real declines in  the demand for timber. In addition to tI,ese  real factors, a third artificial factor was also  introduced.

The domestic consumption of wood  products is predicted to remain high, while overseas markets  are expected to continue to show modest improvement.  Furthermore, the U.S. dollar is expected to remain weak.  A possible agreement with Canada, setting quotas on soft­wood  lumber imports is possible. Another item that may have  a positive effect on the industry is the signing of the Healthy  Forest Restoration Act in December. This could lead to an  increase in timber supply from forest management activities  by the U.S. Forest Service.  Information gathered from an annual survey of Idaho  producers conducted as part of this outlook revealed a  somewhat improved forecast for 2004. Overall, 5 I percent of  survey respondents expect 2004 to be a better year, while 43  percent stated they expect it to stay about the same as 2003,  and only 6 percent expect 2004 to be worse.  ] ust over half of the facilities surveyed foresee an increase  in production, while 68 percent expect to experience greater  sales from 2003 to 2004. Furthermore, 46 percent of the  facilities surveyed said they expect to see an increase in profits  from 2003 to 2004. The anticipated increase in profits is  likely to come largely from increases in production and  related lower per unit costs. Only 27 percent of respondents  stated that they expect to sec a major price increase on their  products, while 65 percent of the respondents expect prices  to remain the same as they were in 2003.  Eighty-five percent of the mill operators who responded  saw general market conditions as a major issue that will affect  operations in 2004. While timber supply and availability was  stated as being a major concern by over 40 percent of mill  operators.  Other major concerns expressed by Idaho mill managers  for 2004 include increasing health insurance and energy costs.

Shrub-Steppe Vegetation of the East Fork and the Middle Fork of the Salmon River Drainages,"Authors describe nineteen shrub-steppe communities in the Middle Fork and East Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho.  Bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) occur as dominants or major subdominants throughout the region.  Big sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata), threetip sagebrush (A. tripartita), and low sagebrush (A.arbuscula) are dominants, especially in the East Fork and southern Middle Fork.  Antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) communities exist throughout the region but are most abundant along the Middle Fork, where the species also occurs as a dominant in the understory of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands on drier sites.  Cliffy areas in all regions have curlleaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) and little greenbush (Glossopetalon nevadense) stands, reflecting the specialized habitats on which these communities occur.  Shadscale saltbush (Atriplex confertifolia) communities occupy the driest sites in the lower East Fork.  Common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), antelope bitterbrush, big sagebrush, threetip sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comata) are well represented in the plant communities.  Bluebunch wheatgrass or Idaho fescue or both dominate grassland communities.  Needle-and-thread dominates on some xeric, sandy sites.  The presence of ponderosa pine or Douglas fir in shrub communities suggests these are successional stages of conifer-dominated community types.  At least six conifer communities are represented in ten stands dominated by common snowberry, in thirteen dominated by ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), five dominated by Idaho fescue, and three dominated by mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana).  Seven sites exclosed between 1915 and 1950 provide evidence of reduction in shrubs and expansion of grassland and herbaceous portions of these communities in the Middle Fork.  A record of a stand photographed in 1925, 1968, and 1988 appears to corroborate these findings.  Changes in species composition of these communities are attributed to changes in species of herbivores, including livestock, mule deer, and elk; to alterations in the natural fire regime; and to weather patterns that affected woody and herbaceous plants differently over the period.  The major fire of 2000 in the Middle Fork drainage appears to have increased cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) at least temporarily, and to have reduced nonresprouting shrubs including big sagebrush, curlleaf mountain mahogany, and antelope bitterbrush.  Subsequent establishment of new plants from seeds has occurred on sites burned in the most recent fires.  Productivity of bluebunch wheatgrass was reduced for one year following the 2000 fire.","Peek, James M.; Yeo, Jeffrey J.; Hickey, William O.; Lauer, Jerry L.; Claar, James C.",,2005,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Station Bulletin 82,"Idaho QH76.5 I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/",The Nature Conservancy; Salmon National Forest; Umatilla Agency; U.S. Forest Service Region 1;,uifwre-sb82,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Idaho's Foresl Products Industry II  Idaho's Forest Products Industry:  Current Conditions and Forecast, 2005  Operating Conditions In Idaho  Prices for most wood and paper products were up con­siderably  in 2004 relative to 2003. Lumber prices moved  from near historic lows in early 2003 to near record highs in  the third quarter of2004 (Figure I ). Yearly average lumber  prices in 2004 were approximately 30 percent above those  in 2003. High wood product prices were caused by several  factors:  • Domestic lumber consumption was at record levels,  with low mortgage rates encouraging high levels of  building activity;  • The value of the dollar saw sharp declines against a  number of major currencies which increased the price  of imported wood products;  • A number of other cQwltries had increased demand for  lumber and wood products;  • Wood products orders by the federal government  increased for reconstruction in Mghanistan and Iraq;  • Demand for wood products in the Southeastern United  States also increased due to the severe hurricane season.

This was in part due to higher sawtimber prices which  encouraged private land owners to sell timber. Private land  owners, the State ofIdaho, and the National Forests all  showed increased harvest (Figure 2 ).  Idaho Industry Sales, Employment,  Production for 2004  The estimated sales value of Idaho's primary wood and  paper products for 2004 was $1.99 billion, almost 20 per­cent  higher than the revised 2003 sales value (Figure 3). The  wood and paper products industry in Idaho employed about  16,200 workers in 2004, a slight increase from the 16,000 in  2003 (Figure 4).  Estimated timber harvest for 2004 was 1.17 billion board  feet, which is an increase of slightly more than 8 percent from  the 2003 timber harvest of 1.08 billion board feet (Figures 2  and 5). Estimated lumber production in Idaho for 2004 was  a new record high of2.14 billion board feet, up about 10  percent from 1.95 billion board feet in 2003 (Figure 5).

Outlook lor 2005  Lumber prices have dropped substantially from the near  record-high levels experienced in the third quarter of2004.  However, at year-end they were still at relatively high levels  when compared to the averages of the last several years and  are expected to hold at or near these levels well into 2005.  The domestic consumption of wood products is predicted to  slow slightly due to increasing mortgage interest rates. This  willlead to a slight drop in housing starts and may calise  small declines in the repair and remodel market as well. These  declines in the residential markets may be offset by increases  in non-residential uses. An on-going source of uncertainty is  the continuing dispute between Canada and the U.S. con­cerning  tariffs and penalties on softwood lumber imports.  Timber supply remains uncertain going into 2005. Even  with a modest increase in 2004, both National Forest harvest  and volume sold were near fifty year lows (Figure 2). Har­vests  on other public lands may increase slightly, and ifprices  do not drop sharply the volume of private harvest should be  about on par with 2004. National Forest harvest increases are  likely to be associated with fire hazard reduction or ecosystem  restoration treatments but are dependent on budgets and  other social factors. Projects that produce commercial timber  products from federal lands are frequently targeted for appeals  and litigation.  Information gathered from the annual survey of Idaho  producers echo assessments of slightly weaker markets and  concerns over timber availability for 2005. Overall, 43  percent of the survey respondents expect 2005 to be a better  year tl1an 2004, while 37 percent expect 2005 to stay abour  the same, and 20 percent expect 2005 to be worse.  Just over half of the producers surveyed anticipate  an increase in production) while 45 percent expect to  experience greater sales for 2005. Only 39 percent of the  facilities surveyed said they expected to see an increase in  profits for 2005, while 4 I percent expect profits to decrease.  Furthermore) 26 percent expect to see price increases on their  products, while 41 percent expect prices to decrease.  General market conditions were listed by 70 percent  of the mill operators as a major issue that will affect their  operation in 2005, while timber supply and availability were  stated as being major concerns by over 65 percent of the mill  operators. Other major concerns expressed for 2005 included  increased costs for health insurance, transportation, and  energy.",,,2014-09-03,2018-11-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/fwres/id/52,52,146.pdf,/fwres/image/146.pdf,fwres52

Families  were interviewed during the 1964 recreation season to gain infor­mation  on activity preferences, facility and service evaluations  and preferences, and some tourist and economic data.  Map of northern Idaho with location of Indian Creek,  Heyburn and Little Round Lake State Parks.  Four hundred four families were interviewed representing  1612 users. Their responses were volunta ry, interesting and in  no case was there a refusal. Family sizes averaged 3.3 at Hey­burn,  3.8 at Little Round Lake, and 4.2 at Indian Creek. The  number of days each family spent recreating at one of these  three parks varied from five at Heyburn to eight at Indian  Creek. The young family group predominated in all three parks.  This group, containing the parents (ages 20-44) and children  (ages 12 and under), represented 34.2 and 36.8 percent respec­tively  or 71 percent of the total people interviewed. Th: inde­pendent  adolescents (ages 13-19) represented t 7.5 percent and  the people 45 years or older represented 11.5 percent of the  total users.  How far will people travel to enjoy Idaho's lakes and  scenic splendor? The study indicated that 75 percent of the  people using Heyburn, 85 percent using Indian Creek, and 88  percent using Little Round Lake were from outside the State  of Idaho. Of these out-of-state users, 74 percent were from the  neighboring State of Wash inglon. The remainder of the out-of­state  visitors came primarily from Oregon, Utah, Montana and  Wyoming. Many came from California, a few from the Canadian  Provinces and some from as far away as Texas, Illinois and  Pennsylvania.  The next consideration is the user evaluation of facilities and  services. Users responded prima rily to questions regarding park­ing,  water supply, toilets, campgrounds and boat docks. Other  facilities and services received relatively minor attention. Users  were mainly dissatisfied with toilets, roads, trails, rental facilities,  concessions and tours (Table I).  T.ble 1.

As individuals, each of us  considers our leisure-time recreation a personal matter. Most of  us, however, are ready to relate what we did on our vacation  and the thrifty way in which we accomplished our enjoyment.  Idaho's State Park use rs were no different (Table 3).  Table 3.

Camping, by itself, was considered by most  families as a means of living and enjoying activities together.  D..mping for leisure was mentioned by only one of the inter­viewed  families.  When a family recreates in the foregoing manner, what is  the cost - what is the family spending? It was found that the  average amount one person spent per day was $1.57. The amount  one person spent per day in the area of the three State Parks  was $1.29. This amount spent by one person per day in the  area represents 82 percent of the total amount each spent  per day. The value of the amount of money spent in  each area is questionable because, to the user, ""in area"" meant  anywhere from in a park to 75 miles away. A more realist ic  figure was secured from late summer interviews at Heyburn  State Park. By comparing total money spent with the expendi-tures  at park concessions and the adjacent towns of Plummer  and St. Maries, it was found that only 50 percent of the total  money spent per person was spent in the area. ---- ----. ....  The question often asked by Chambers of Commerce, Tourist  Information Departments, and State Agencies is ""what motivated  people to come and recreate in Idaho?"" These groups will find  it disheartening to know that 89 percent of the interviewed fam­ilies  had previously visited Idaho or came at the recommendation  of friends or relatives. The initial family contact, however, may  have come from various tourist and recreation information  sources. The remai ning families (II percent) did receive motiva­tion  primarily from the Chambers of Commerce, State Agencies  and Tourist Information Booths. Media such as newspaper and  magazine stories and travel show booths provided the least  amount of motivation.  Beca use this is a preliminary study related to a more detailed  research project, fi nal conclusions cannot be drawn from the  information presented. The user has, however, provided the State  with extremely valuable information relative to many aspects of  its recreation program. This information should be evaluated in  terms of planning and managing parks, providing facilities and  services, providing recreational opportunities, and presenting a  positive public re lations and information program. This study  should not imply that the State's recreation program bow to  every wish of each user, but indicates that Idaho's program is  lagging and that she should take corrective action where necessary.",,,2014-09-03,2018-11-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/fwres/id/53,53,147.pdf,/fwres/image/147.pdf,fwres53

Pitkin'  The acreage needing forestation in the United  States is tremendous, but current or projected  planting programs do not begin to oope with the  challenge. To many foresters, direct seeding has  long seemed the obvious recourse. In the northern  Rockies, however, this technique has generally  proved fruitless. The dearth of applicable tech­nical  information concerning direct seeding un­doubtedly  is largely responsible for the many  failures reported within the region. The experi­ment  described below represents one part of a  new attempt to determine the synthesis of species,  site preparation and time of seeding necessary  for maximum success under conditions oommonly  encountered in the field.  SITE  Plots were located on a northwest slope near  the town of Blanchard in Bonner County. The  study area probably supported climax vegetation  typical of the Thuja plicatalPachistima myrsi­nites  association. About 20 years ago a wildfire  devastated the site, and a heavy brush invasion  followed. Inland Empire Paper Company, owners  of the property, sprayed the brush with 2,4,5,T in  the spring of 1960 and carried out a controlled  burn the following fall. The company attempted  to restock the area by means of aerial seeding  after the burn. A mixture of Douglas fir (Ps eu­dotBuga  menziesii (Mirb.)

Results were generally disappoint..  ing, with adequate germination and survival  achieved on only a small fraction of the acreage  involved. Because of the past history of direct  seeding failures throughout the entire region, a  small portion of the area had been reserved for  experimental work and was purposely left out of  the direct seeding tria!. This portion became the  site of the study reported herein (Figure 1).  •  Figure 1. General view of experimental area near Blan­chard.  Idaho. Technicians afe placing colored  toothpicks next to newly emerged seedlings .  l  l  Soil texture of the plot area was silt loam,  % atmosphere water holding capacity 24.3%,  and 15 atmosphere water holding capacity  12.3%. The pH of the surface horizon was 6.5,  and organic matter content 2.73%.  At the time the experiment was initiated (one  year afer the controlled burn mentioned above)  little natural revegetation had occurred on the  site.  METHOD  An area of approximately %, acre was divided  in half, one subdivision to be used for fall seed­ing  in 1961, the other to be seeded in the spring  of 1962. Those two sections were then halved  again. One portion of the fall division and one of  the spring division received no treatment other  than the controlled burn cited previously. The  remaining parts of both sections were cultivated  shortly before the fall seeding operation.  Planting of seed, species used, and number of  replications were same on each of the four sub­divisions  of the experimental area. Eight hun­dred  seeds each (8 replicates, 100 seeds per rep­licate)  of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa,  Laws.), Douglas fir, grand fir, and western red  cedar were drilled in 25 foot rows on each sec­tion.  Fall plots were sown November 7, 1961, and  spring plots on May 3, 1962.  Throughout the experimental period, soil  moisture (3 and 8 inch depth) and surface tem­perature  data were monitored for all plot condi­tions.  Precipitation and air temperature records  of the site were also maintained.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Whereas moisture was adequate throughout  the spring germination period, during July and  August (the critical months for seedling sur­vival)  only 0.69 of an inch of precipitation was  recorded. Of this total, 0.53 of an inch occurred  in the week ending August 7th. Air temperature  exceeded 90° F on eight days in July and three  in August.  On May 17, 31, June 14 and 24 examinations  were made of seedling emergence. Those seed­lings  newly appearing on each date were staked  with different colored toothpicks. Counts of seed­lings  surviving at the end of the growing season  were made on September 26. Emergence and sur­vival  both by week and in total were tallied on  the basis of species, season of seeding, site treat­ment  and combinations of these variables. A  separate statistical evaluation was made for ger­mination  and survival data.  Emergence was practically nil before May 17  (Table 1). On fall seeded plots, without exception,  by far the greatest emergence occurred during  the period of May 17 to 31 and tapered off sharp­ly  thereafter. This pattern was not unexpected.  Chemical effects on the overwintering seed would  doubtlessly promote early emergence. In contrast,  many spring seeded plots had notably higher  emergence during the period May 31-June 14  than during the preceding two weeks. One im­portant  exception to this trend can be noted in  the data for ponderosa pine seeded in the spring  on burned and cultivated soil. Here twice as  many seeds emerged during May 17 to 31 than  from May 31 to June 14.  Table 1. Cronological trends in seed emergence.

The time of emergence may have influenced  the fate of seedlings. Within a particular species,  those treatments producing relatively high seed  emergence percentages by May 31 generally show­ed  higher seedling survival at the end of the grow­ing  season. Evidently the earlier emerging seed­lings  were able to produce a more extensive root  system before the onset of summer drought than  were the later emerging plants.  The analysis of variance for both emergence  and survival data revealed that many significant  or highly significant differences occurred. Dun­can's  New Multiple Range Test was utilized to  determine where these significant differences  lay.  A comparison of overall species performance,  without regard to season of planting or method  of ground preparation, may first be made. From  the standpoint of emergence, there was no sig­nificant  difference between Douglas fir and pond­erosa  pine. However, both of these species pro­duced  significantly better emergence than grand  fir, which in turn significantly out-performed  cedar. Survival results differed from those found ~  TO CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS H.Orr,  l  for emergence in that ponderosa pine was signifi­cantly  better than Douglas fir. Seventy-four per  cent of emerged ponderosa pine seedlings sur­vived  the first growing season, compared to 50%  of the Douglas fir.  Season of seeding markedly affected results.  Method of ground preparation is not a factor in  these particular comparisons. The best emergence  was achieved with fall sown Douglas fir. Spring  seeded Douglas fir ranked fourth, behind both  spring and fall seeded ponderosa pine. When  survival is considered, however, the spring seeded  ponderosa pine was significantly superior to fall  seeded pine, as well as to all other species­f:  eason of seeding treatments. Actual survival per-centages  ranged for 77% for the spring seeded  ponderosa pine to only 8 % for spring seeded  cedar.  The data concerning effect of ground prep­aration  on emergence and survival of the four  species, regardless of season of seeding, indicate  that best results in both emergence and survival  occurred where the previously burned plots were  cultivated and seeded with ponderosa pine. No  significant difference in survival was found  among seedlings on uncultivated ponderosa pine,  uncultivated Douglas fir, and cultivated Douglas  fir plots.  The most critical comparisons can be observed  in figure 2, a graphical presentation of inter­actions  involving all three variables. In order  to ascertain clearly where significant differences  among the 8 most successful treatments occurred,  reference to Table 2 should be made. Treatments  not joined by the same line differ significantly  from each other, whereas those which are joined  by the same line do not.  No significant difference was found between  emergence of spring seeded ponderosa pine on  burned and cultivated land and fall seeded Doug­las  fir on land which was burned only. However,  it should be stressed that survival of seedlings  from this particular ponderosa pine treatment was  Significantly better than that found for the Doug­las  fir treatment and superior survival is, of  course, the ultimate goal.  Several factors contributed to the superior  performance of the spring seeded ponderosa pine.  Of the species investigated, the seed of the ponder­osa  pin is most preferred by rodents. Thus, more  seed loss of the species might be expected where  seed was available for many months rather than  : for a short time in the spring. As a result, less  . seed would be available for germination on fall  seeded ponderosa pine plots than on spring seeded  plots. Movement of seed off fall seeded plots can  probably be rejected as an influence in this  experiment because the seed was drilled into the  soil, rather than being placed on the surface. Then  too, the superior emergence of fall seeded Douglas  fir, 'grand fir, and cedar indicates that rodent  feeding preferences, rather than washing, was a  "" dominant effect.

By late August water  content of the soil had reached the wilting point  at the 3 inch depth on all plots without exception,  but remained well above this at the 8 inch depth  on plots which had received cultivation. The well  known ability of ponderosa pine to rapidly ex­tend  a tap root enabled the seedlings to utilize  this source of moistur e, with consequent benefit  to survival. In contrast, the other species with  more of their roots concentrated in the surface  soil, were more prone to succumb to moisture  stress.  Temperature of the soil su rface ranged be­t.  ween 1250 and 1380 F every week during the  summer. Ponderosa pine is usually thought to be  more resistant to heat damage than the other  species utilized. Thus, although direct evidence  is lacking, this insolation effect cannot be dis­counted  in assessing results .  .. •z  :::;  Q  OJ  .O.J  ~  lon-l-_  OOUILAS 'IR  FALL, BURNED a CULTIVATED  D'lIUt'D  ,.RI .. , ....

Successful management of crested wheatgrass range, as well as  other types of forage areas, requires an artful application of scie ntific  principles. General guides such as 50 or 65 percent utilization levels or  rigid patte rns of ro tation among pastures a re inadequate for the inten­sive  management that will be needed as rangeland area decreases and  other land llses impose restrictions on the amount of forage harvested  by grazing animals.  Essential to the formulation of a management program fur the  effective use of rangeland is a knowledge of: (1) the goals and objec­tives  to be achieved, (2) general plant growth characteristics, (3)  limitations imposed on forage production by habitat conditions, (4) the  relationship of forage production to alternative grazing practices and  (5) the requirements of grazing animals and the livestock operation.  Other information is often required such as the use of the rangeland  area for purposes other than grazing, but such considerations are outside  the scope of this paper.  Goals and Objectives for Management  It is assumed, for the purpose of the material to be presented, that  optimum sustained livestock production is the primary goal in man­aging  crested wheatgrass. This goa l can best be achieved hy ma intaining  the stand of grass in a productive state and protecting the soil resource  from dete rioration. Pursuing this goal generally does not detract from  other resource values such as maintaining favorable wildlife habita t.  watershed values and sceni c attractive ness.  Description of the Expcrimenhll Area  The Point Springs Expe rimental area, located in the Haft River  Valley of Cassia County, Idaho at an elevation of approximately 4800  feet, has similar physiograph ic features as large parts of Nevada, Utah  and eastern Oregon. Broad va lleys bordered by parallel mountain  ranges characterize these areas. Annual precipitation averages about  twelve inche. at the experimental site, but has varied from 6 to 18  inches during the twelve years from 1957-1968. Tahle 1. About 35 to 40  percent of the annual precipitation falls during the months of April,  May and June, tbe period most important for plant growth. The gray  desert soils of the area have limited development. The depth to a  restrictive layer varies from six inches to 19 or 20 inches and averages  about 12-13 inches.

In the viewpoint of the writer,  crested wheatgrass is adapted to the Point Springs area largely as a  result of the high proportion of tt,e annual precipitation that falls during  the growing season.  The vegetation on the study area probahly consisted of an Artemisia  tridentata-Agrop yroll spicatum association. Big sagebrush (Artemisia  tridentata ) and bluehunch wheatgrass (Agrop yron Spicatum ) dominated  but Sandberg's bluegrass ( Poa securda ) occurred frequently. Grease­wood  ( Sarcobattls vermiclI!atlls) and rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus vis­cidif!  orus) appeared less frequently. A few annual forbs comprised the  spring flora and perennial forb ssuch as death camas (ZigadenttS pani­culatus  ) and loco weed ( Astragalus beckwithii ) occurred scattered in the  area.  Interspersed in the sagebrush-blue bunch wheatgrass association on  the salty soils mentioned previously were small islands containing salt­sage  com:munities. The principal species, saltsage (Atrip/ex nuttrallii),  may have been associated with Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides)  and squirrel tail grass (Sitanion hystrix ).  Heavy livestock grazing in the days of settlement and prior to  regulated use of the public domain drastically altered the original vege­tation.  Herbaceous species declined and the woody species, especially  big sagebrush, increased in amount. Livestock grazing capacity was  rated at 27 acres per animal unit month by the Bureau of Land Manage­ment  in the early 1950's compared to an estimated 3-5 acres when live­stock  were introduced.  Immediately prior to seeding, the study area had a thick cover of  big sagebrush and some rabbitbrush. Herbaceous species occurred infre­quently  and these consisted primarily of Sandberg's bluegrass, halogeton  (Halogeton glomeratus), Russian thistle (Salsola Kali), tansy mustard  (Desctlrainia richare/sonii) and peppergrass (LepidiUln perfoliatum). The  shrubs and other plants were removed with a wheatland disc plow on  approximately 7,000 acres in the summer of 1952. Planting of crested  wheatgrass and yellow sweetclover (Melilotlls officinalis ) took place in  the fall of the same year at the rate of 5.5 pounds and 1.1 pounds per  acre, respectively. A fl exible harrow drag covered the seed broadcasted  with an E-Z flow fertilizer spreader.  A number of annual plants grew in the extremely favorable spring  of 1953. Tansy mustard, peppergrass, and Russian thistle attained con­siderable  size during this period and obscured the crested wheatgrass  plants. The extremely dry growing season of 1954 caused poor growth  of the annual plants. TIle material produced by Russian thistle in 1953,  however, remained on the ground as dry material in 1954 and provided  protection from drying winds for the young crested wheatgrass plants.  The stand of crested wheatgrass was well established by the fall of that  year despite the drought in 1954. Experimental grazing trials com­menced  in the spring of 1955 and have continued through 1969.  3  The experimental trials consisted of grazing yearling cattle at three  intensities, SO, 65, and 80 percent (light, moderate, and heavy) utiliza­lion  .of the forage supply in each of two seasons, spring and fall. Spring  grazmg commenced about May 1 and fall grazing started in early  September. The grazing period varied between 45 and 56 days in each  season. The animals grazed 160-acre fenced areas between 1955 and  1960. Division of the 160-acre pastures in 1960 provided for the addition  of spring-falI grazing combinations on 80-acre pasture areas, Figure 1.  Abandonment of the light and moderate falI grazing treallnents after  the 1965 trials provided area for an alternating early and late spring  grazing treatment.  General Growth Characteristics of Crested Wheatgrass  In the Raft River Valley, growth of crested wheatgrass genera lIy  starts in mid-March to early April. New growth on the first of April  averages about 70-85 pounds per acre. Crested wheatgrass stands at  lower elevations and on areas with warmer temperatures could be  expected to have two or three times this amount of production on the  first of April.  Crested wheatgrass herbage accumulates generally at a rate be­tween  four and seven pounds per acre per day during April and aver­ages  between 200 and 300 pounds per acre the first of May. With ade­quate  moisture and warm temperatures, growth rate may exceed this  value and a production as high as 400 pounds of new growth on May 1  has been recorded at Point Springs. With the advent of warmer tem­peratures  in May, the growth rate increases and may be as high as 20  or 25 pounds but averages about 10-15 pounds per acre per day.  With growth generally complete by mid-July, the grass rapidly  loses or has lost green color. Growth terminates earlier in a dry year,  or, with summer precipitation, continues on into the fall. New green  growth develops in the fall of some years when moisture and tempera­ture  conditions are suitable. The 150 to 200 pounds of fall growth on  crested wheatgrass in 1968, following a moist August, contrasts sharply  with the less than SO to 100 pounds produced in some other years of  the study.  The stem apex of crested wheatgrass, near the surface of the ground  until early May, elongates rapidly until late Mayor early June. Heads  emerge from the boot in late Mayor early june and flowering occurs  from mid-to late June. With the stem apex intact the stem wilI continue  to grow. Once the stem apex has been removed, that stem ceases to grow  and alI regrowth must come from buds at the base of the grazed stem.  The new stem mayor may not produce a seed head. The new growth,  often more leafy than the original stem first grazed, has significance in  the nutritive value of the forage for falI grazing.  Impact of Climatic Conditions on Growth Characteristics  Climatic conditions during anyone year have a decided influence  on the growth characteristics of crested wheatgrass. The amount and  distribution of April, May and June precipitation largely determines the  annual forage production at Point Springs. Air and soil temperatures  also influence plant growth during this period of suitable soil moisture.  4  Spr ing L i g h t L i g h t Sp r i ng Hea v y Spr i n~  I!. F a II Spr i'ng & Sp r i n g I!.

Figure 2. Between 70 and 80 percent of this variabil ity in production  can be attributed to the amount of preci pitation that fall s on the area  in April, May and June. vVith accumulated winter moisture gene rally  sufficient during April for plant growth, temperatures largely influence  growth rate in this month. The increase in air dry production during  April varies from about four to seven pounds per day, Table 2. The  generally warmer tempe ratures in May provide the stimulus for rapid  growth jf moisture conditions are suitable. The growth rate in 1967  varied between 19 and 25 pounds per day after mid·May. Less than  two pounds per day of growth occurred durin ~ this period in 1969,  Table 2. Lack of moisture rather than unsuitable temperatures limited  growth rate in late May of 1969.  Table 2.

Soil areas with high concentrations of  exchangeable sodium occur within the less salty areas of soil and range  in size from Jess than one acre to about 15 acres. During years with  less than average growing season precipitation, these saline areas have  a more stunted herbage growth than the Jess sa line areas. The number  and size of the crested wheatgrass plants on the salt y areas often decline  during or following the dry years. Little or no difference has been  observed between the two kinds of soil areas in years with above aver­age  growing season precipitation, Figure 3.  Impact of Grazing on Plant Growth  Grazing practices have an influence on stand density, herbage  production and nutritive value of the forage produced. The nature and  extent of the grazing influence on plant growth vary with weather  conditions, soil type, intensity and time of grazin g and other factors.  6  _1  900  800 ~rm  •  u  700  &lt;t 600  •  '"" 500  ~  ~, 400  o  Q. 300  ~  I-  ....

I n general, dose  cropping of crested whcatgrass for a number of years during the  growing season causes a reduction in ph-1l1t size, a decrease in the  number of plants and a less uniform distribution of pla nts over the  area, Table 3.

This results because of the lower  amount of residue carried over to the following year at the heavier  intensities of grazing. In UJ67, at the conclusion of the spring grazing  trials, the crude protein content of the herbage remaining was 11.4  pe rcent in the light use pasture, 11.9 pe rcent in the moderate use pasture  and 16.7 percent in the heavy use pasture.  Pastures grazed in the spring and again the fall had a crude protein  content of about seven to eight percent in August of 1967 compared to  about five percent crude protein for the pasture un grazed in the spring  previous to the fa ll grazing trials. Spring grazing at light to moderate  1evels stimulates new till er development on a t least part of the plants  in the pasture and this new leafy growth has a higher nutritive value  than the un grazed plants or ti llers.  Impact of Grazing on Forage Production. Although climatic condi­ti  ons appear to have the greatest impact on crested wheatgrass growth  characteristics and forage production, previous and current grazing  treatments also have an influence.  The three pastures grazed at the three intensities in the spring had  similar forage production in 1957. During: periods of above average  prec ipitation (1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965), the calculated forage produc­tion  in the heavy use pasture was below that of the pastures used at  lesser intensities. No great difference in forage production occurred  among treatments in drier than average years (1960, 1961, 1966 and  19(9). When moisture is deficient in May, as in the years indicated,  little plant growth occurs during May and consequently, grazing after  May 1 has little influence on the annual forage production. Annual  production in the heavy grazing intensity pasture averaged about 12  percent less than production in the light and moderate grazing treat­ments  over the thirteen-year period 1957-1969. The reduction in an nual  production , however, was 36 percent in the favorable growing year of  1963.  Response of Crested Wheatgrass Stands Following a  Change in ~1 anagement Practices  The grazing trials at the Point Springs e,perimental a rea show  that a stand of crested wheatgrass may persist for more than 15 years  under continuous heavy grazing in the spring of the year. This charac­te  ristic of crested wheatgrass rangeland provides for fl eXibility in meet­ing  management objectives.  A portion of the pasture grazed at the heavy intensity in the spring  received no grazing use in 1968 or 1969. Prior to the start of the grazing  treatments in 196R, simil ar initial production occurred on the portion of  the pasture to he rested and the .portion that would continue to receive  heavy spring gra zi'lg. After one year of rest, the initial production  douhled on the rested portion compared to that on the portion grazed  heavily the previous spring, Tahle 5. Almost twice the total production  developed in 1969 on the rested area compa red to the non-rested area.  10  Table 5. Forage production on May 1st and total forage production  on an area rested from grazing in 1968 and 1969 after 13  years of heavy grazing compared with an adjacent area con·  tinuously grazed heavily for 15 years.  Hested in 1968 and 1969  Grazed continuously in  the spring 1955-1969  Initial Forage  Production May 1,  1968 1969  (Pounds per Acre)  Total Forage  Production  1968 1969  148 166 554 419  141 87 488 219  Data from the Bliss Point Seeding north of Bliss, Idaho show  comparative production rates in 1969 of 352 pounds per acre after two  years of rest, 400 pounds after four years and 506 pounds per acre  after five years of rest from grazing. The extremely poor growing  conditions in 1969 may have had an influence on the relative magni­tude  of the differences that occurred in this year.  The data at Point Springs suggest that similar results can be  obtained by alternating the timing of grazing in the spring from early  to late season in succeeding years. Although this grazing treatment has  been tested for only a. short time, a positive response has developed.  The pasture used in early spring has sufficient time, in most years, for  regrowth following removal of the animals. The regrowth has a rela­tively  high nutrient content for 'fall grazing and enhances animal pro­duction  in this period. It is recommended that the pasture grazed in the  late part of the spring season not be grazed in the fall in most years.  Since animal numbers are allocated on the basis of anticipated forage  production in 'the pasture grazed first, the late grazed pasture has  considerable residue remaining at the conclusion of the spring grazing  period. In the event that plant growth the following year is slow or  limited in deve lopment because of weather conditions, animals have a  forage supply with which to start the grazing season because of the  residue carry-over. In 1969 the pasture grazed first in 1968 and again  in the fall had 106 pounds of new growth and 48 pounds of forage  residue on May 1. The pasture grazed late in the spring of 1968 had  167 pounds of new growth and 328 pounds of residue carry-over on  May 1, 1969.  Stocking Rates for Crested Wheatgrass Pastures  The light intensity of use treatment in the spring has been stocked  at an average of 1.5 acres per yearling animal month compared to 1.4  and 1.2 acres per yearling animal month for the moderate and heavy  use pastures respectively, Table 6. Translating this to AUM's by assum­ing  that one yearling is 0.6 of an animal unit provides an average  stocking rate of 2.5 acres per A UM for light grazing and 2.1 acres per  A UM for heavy grazing in the spring period.  11  Table 6. Stocking rate in acres per yearling animal month and acres  per animal unit month for three intensities of use in the  spring season 1957-1969.  Light Moderate Heavy  Average  Acres/ Yearling Animal Month 1.5 1.4 1.2  Acres/Animal Unit Month 2.5 2.4 2.1  Range  Acres/ Yearling Animal Month 2.5-0.8 2.3-0.7 1.6-0.7  Acres/Animal Unit Month 4.2-1.4 3.9-1.2 2.8-1.2  Stoelting rates have varied from 4.2 acres per AUM under light  grazing to 1.2 acres per AUM under moderate and heavy grazing over  the years of study.  In the latter years of study, however, the moderate and sometimes  the light grazing treatments required fewer acres per AUM than the  heavy grazing treatment. This resulted from a relative decline in forage  production in the heavy intensity pasture and a larger forage residue  carryover in the light and moderately grazed pastures.  It is relatively easy under experimental conditions to vary the  number of anima ls in any year to fit the forage supply or anticipated  forage supply of the specific year. It is much more difficult to vary  animal numbers if the livestock operation depends on a yearly sustained  supply of AUM's of grazing. Some possi ble alternatives for meeting this  problem will be presented later in the paper.  Range Reacliness  Animal welfare generally has more importance than other consid­erations  in de termining the time to begin grazing on rangeland seeded  with crested wheatgrass. This plant species does not suffer to the  extent that blue-bunch wheatgrass does by earl y grazing. The growing  point of the stem remains at or below the plant crown level until early  May and consequently heavy demands on the organic reserves for the  initiation of new tiller growth are not made until this growing point has  been removed by grazing.  Most important to the time that gra zing starts is the forage supplv  available. This will vary with e levation, spring and winter weather  conditions, previous grazing practices and other local factors. At Point  Springs forage production averaged 70-85 pounds per acre about the  first of April and growth during the month added four to six pounds  per day. If an animal requires about 25 pounds of dry matter per day,  each animal unit would have to harvest all the forage from an acre  within 3 to 4 days to satisfy the animal's daily dry matter requirement.  Assuming that a grazing animal's mouth is five to six inches wide, this  ""mower"" blade would have to travel a distance of about four to five  12  •  miles to harvest 25 pounds of dry matter when forage production is 70  to 85 pounds per acre. It is not likely that the animal will be able to  satisfy die tary requirements under these conditions.  Animal requirements are more easily met at Point Springs in late  April and ea rly ~vl ay when product.ion is 200·300 pounds per acre and  rate of growth is much grea ter. Substantial amounts of plant residue  remaining frorn the previous year permit an earlier grazing start than  if little or no residue is present on th e area.  Animal Response to Grazing Treatments  Animal gains and gains per acre at the Point Springs experimental  pastures arc shown in Figure 4. The values presented arc for a six-year  period, 1800-1965. Data are available for a longer period of time on  most treatments but some change in pasture design in 1960 and a  change in some grazing treahnents in 1965 limit comparability of all  treatments beyond 1965. Data over the longer period, 1957-1969, on the  unchanged treatments, however, show that the 1960-1965 data are  comparable to the longer term data.  As would be expected, animal gains decline and gains per acre  increase with increasing grazing intensity. Animal gains in the spring  range between III pounds per animal under heavy grazing to 122  pounds with light grazing. Cains per acre in the spring average 48  pounds with light grazing compared to 53 pounds with heavy grazing.  Fall gains per animal varied from 25 pounds with heavy fall  grazing only to 34 pounds on pastures grazed the previous spring and  again in the fall. Fall gain per acre varied from nine pounds under light  grazing to 14 pounds with heavy grazing. Fall gain per acre was least  (eight pounds) in the pastures grazed the previous spring.  Of significance in the management of crested wheatgrass rangeland  is the higher animal gain in the spring and also in the fall on those  pastures grazed both spring and fall. Total gain per acre in pastures  grazed spring and fall is comparable to the moderately grazed spring  pasture. The less intense spring grazing on the spring-fall pastures main­tainecl  stand density and forage production and the combined spring-fall  grazing improved the nutritive quality of the fon\ge in both seasons.  TI,e combined spring ancl fall grazing also largely eliminated the  problem of ""wolf"" plants in the pas ture area, consequently all plants  contribute to the forage supply.  The alternatin g spring grazing treatment has been tested for such  a short time that it is not possible to indicate animal response patterns  at the present time.  Some data are available that compare animal gains during various  seasons of the year, Table 7. These data have been obtained in a variety  of ways and serve only to illustrate comparative gains by each class  of animal in the three seasons. For example, in some years, the same  yearlings used in the spring grazing trials on the experimental pastures  were returned for the fall trials after grazing on privately owned crested  wheatgrass range during the summer. One owner has a permit on the  large Point Springs seeding for spring, summer and fall use; these  animals provide the data on cow and calf gains.  13 .IJAII  100  75  50  25  20  10  Figure 4.  ~ '"" ..J  Sprino  Sprino  ~  o&gt; • r  Gain per Animal  .c-""_ '-­a  ... &lt;&gt;  '""  -~  '"" ..J  G oin per Acre  ""'"" ..J  Fa II  Fall  -• &gt;~  ~ a • • "" :z:  0  :E  .""-c '=.a..  ~  '""  Sprino ·  Fa II  Average animal gain and gain per acre in the spring and fall grazing  periods.

Cows have gained between one and two pounds per day in the  spring and 0.2 to 1.8 pounds in the summer. Fall gains ranged from a  loss of 0.4 pounds to a gain of 0.8 pounds per day. Calf gains ranged  from 1.5 to 2.0 pounds per day in the spring and were about two pounds  a day in the summer period. Calves ran ged in weight from 135 to 200  pounds near the end of April and weighed in excess of 400 pounds  about the first of November.  Yearling animals generally gained in the neighborhood of two  pounds or more per day in the spring and about a pound per day in the  summer. Variations in forage supply, amount of green growth and other  factors caused considerable variation in fall gains.  Sufficient green growth of crested wheat grass occurs in some years  to augment the nutritive value of the dry grass and animals respond  accordingly. For example, sufficient green growth developed in the fall  of 1968 to produce 1.8 pounds per day of gain on yearling animals  during the first 28 days of trial. Because of the quantity of green  material available in the fa ll of this year, the yearlin g animals consumed  much greater quantities of forage than normally in the fall. As a conse­quence,  all pastures were overstocked and gains diminished to 0.5  pounds per day during the las t 28 days of the trial period. Quantity and  not quality of forage became limiting in this case. Green material at  the beginning of the fall trials in 1965 was sufficient to produce high  animal gains. Cold temperatures-16°F - early in the trial period dimin­ished  the nutritive value during the remainder of the trial period. The  15  lower nutrient content and unfavorable cHmatic conditions reduced  animal gain compared to 1968.  The forage produced in a year of deficient spring moisture is gener­ally  of good quality and satisfactory gains are made in the fall providing  stocking rates insure the animals an adequate quantity of forage.  Animal response reflects not only forage characteristics, climatic  conditions and stocking rate, but also the quality and previous manage­ment  of the animals. A comparison of yearling cattle of three owner­ships  show a maximum difference of 72 pounds on April 28, but a  difference of III pounds per animal on October 31, Table 8. Animals  of owner number two were smaller than the animals of owner three,  but gained at about the same rate through the period of grazing. All  animals grazed crested wheatgrass in the spring and fall. Owner two  grazed his animals on crested wheatgrass in the summer, owner one  and OWner three had their animals on forage other than crested wheat­grass  during the summer.  Table 8.

Crested wheatgrass begins growth early in the spring. ew growth  at Point Springs averages 70-85 pounds per acre in early April and  200 to 300 pounds per acre in early May.  2. Precipitation in April, May and June strongly influences yearly  forage production. Forage production may be four or Eive times as  great in a favorable year for plant growth as in a poor year. ew  growth may occur in the fall with August and September precipita­tion.  Fall growth generally does not add substantially to the total  forage production under conditions existing at Point Springs but  nutritive value of the forage is enhanced.  3. Close continuous grazing throughout the growing season causes  stand density, uniformity of plant distribution and forage produc­tion  to decline compared to less intensive spring grazing levels.  16  4. Earl y spring grazing followed by removal of the animals prior to  the time that moisture becomes limiting on plant growth causes  new tillers to develop in some years. These new tillers are more  leafy and nutritious for summer or fall gmzin g. At Point Sprin gs,  grazing until about May 20th followed by removal of the animals  provides the greatest opportunity for such regrowth ,to develop.  5. Light sprin g grazin g onl y of crested wheatgrass causes many of the  fo rage plants to become cuarse and unattractive to grazing animals.  Nutritive valu e uf the forage is less than under more intensive  levels of use.  6. Cluse grazing in the fall of the year callses growth to start at a  later date the following spring and fewer tillers develop on each  plant. With some stubble remaining after grazing in the fall, less  severe temperature extremes occur in the plant crown during the  winter. Favorable spring temperatures for plant growth occur  earlier when some stubble remains from the previous year. ~!(oi s ture  relationships for plant growth may be enhanced hecause o( winter  snow accumulation in the ungrazed stubble.  7. Light fall grazing diminishes animal production and adds to the  ""wolf plant"" prohlem in crested wheat grass stands.  8. Comhining some level of summer or fall grazing with light or  moderate sprin g grazing maintain s stand density, forage production  and increases nutritive value of the forage during all seasons  compared to grazin g at light or moderate intensities in only one  season. Coarseness of the forage plant material and the number of  ""wolf plants"" is diminished with this treatment.  9. Crested wheatgrass stands provide highly nutritious forage in the  spring of the year. Yearling cattle gains generally exceed two  pounds a day from late April to late June. The reproductive rate  of cows and uniformity in size of the calves at weaning time has  improved at Point Springs during the yea rs of study.  10. Earl y gra zing of crested wheatgrass is more detrimental to animal  production than to plant production and vigor at the Point Sprin g's  area. Soil compaction conside rations do not generally limit early  grazing.  11. Fifteen years of heavy spring grazing have not destroyed the stand  of grass in this treatment area at Point Springs. Forage production  has been reduced and stand density has declined, however.  12. Forage production and plant vigor have been restored to heavily  used crested wheatgrass stands by resting a year or two, by defer­ring  grazing during the growing season and/ or alte rnating the  timing of grazing during the growing season.  13. Because of the growth characteristics, tolerance of heavy grazing  and rate at which crested wheatgrass improves vigor and produc­tion,  a number of alternative grazing programs can be devised.  Because of the fl exibility that is possible on this forage type, man­agement  programs for other kinds of rangeland in the operation are  enhanced. Crested wheatgrass vegetation improves the potential  for stabilizing livestock numbers and increases the fl exibility in  manipulating animals to achieve desired ohjectives.  17  14. Efficient management programs for crested wheatgrass vegetation  requires yearl y on-the-ground decisions because of varying climatic  conditions, animal needs and program objectives.  Management Programs for Crested Wheatgrass Rangeland  The followilng suggestions for the management of crested wheat­grass  rangeland are based on the experience gained at the Point Springs  experimental area in southern Idaho. Such programs should be modified  to meet changing conditions and resource management objectives.  One Unit Grazing Management  If the type of grazing program requires that the same area be  grazed about the same time of year every year, stocking rate should be  at some moderate level. On the Point Springs seeding this would be  about 2 to 3 acres per animal unit month when grazed from approxi­mately  May 1st until the desired level of use is achieved. A higher  stocking rate may be possible when the grazing capactiy is obtained by  grazing fewer animals for a longer period of time. This approach pro­vides  the plants a greater leaf surfaC'e area to function in plant growth  during the growing season. A higher concentration of animals for a  shorter period of time will lower forage production approximately 20-30  percent and th11s require more acreage to achieve the desired animal  production.  vVhen the area is to be used both spring and fall as a source of  forage for livestock, stocking at a rate of 3 to 4 acres per animal unit  month in the spring will normally leave adequate forage for fall grazing.  TIle quali ty of fall forage is enhanced nutritively by regrowth that  occurs during the spring period. In most years at Point Springs, animal  gain and gain pe r acre in the fall is much improved in those pastures  grazed as indicated above in contrast to pastures grazed only in the fa ll.  Stand vigor and plant density have been maintained under this program  of management. Fall stocking rate can be adjusted, in numbers or time,  to remove the desired amount of forage. With fall grazing, the develop­ment  of «wolf plants"" is minimized or e liminated.  This program of grazing management provides stability for the  livestock operation primarily through a stocking ra te that can be accom­modated  in the driest years experienced at Point Springs. In years with  below average growing conditions, the amount of fall grazing may be  reduced by selling earl y or providing additional feed or forage areas.  Fall grazing may be increased by staying longer and/ or holding calves  longer in years of ahove average production.  Two Unit Grazing Management  A two unit crested wheatgrass range area provides mOre flexibility in  manipulating animals to attain optimum forage production and conse­quentl  y optimum animal output. With a two unit area, one unit is grazed  18  early one year and late the second year. The sequence of grazing. i.e.  early and late, is' alterl.1ated on the two units in a two year pattern.  The unit grazed early one year will be grazed late the next year and  vice versa.  Under this program, grazing should stop on the fi eld grazed late  when about one-half of the forage is used. The unused forage will  provide material that can be utilized the next year when this unit is  grazed early in the spring. Initial growth will be greater and more rapid  on this unit than on the field grazed early the previous year and again  in the fall. The unit grazed first in 1968 and again in the fall of that  year had produced 106 pounds of new herbage on April 26 in 1969  contrasted to 167 pounds of new forage in the field grazed late in the  spring of 1968. A field deferred from grazing in 1968 after 13 years of  heavy spring grazing had an initial production of 165 pounds of new  herbage compared to 82 pounds on the unrested adjacent area.  The fi eld grazed early may be used again later, or in the fall, if  regrowth has occurred. This provides good quality fall forage and  animals respond wen to this treatment.  Stocking rates can generally be somewhat higher than under con­tinuous  grazing. In years of below average precipitation, the production  ill the unit grazed second is known at the time grazing starts and the live­stock  operator has time to make required adjustments. vVith the two  unit system and recognizing the fact that crested wheatgrass will toler­ate  at least a year or two of severe grazing, drastic adiustments in  animal numbers should not be necessary. Adjustments in timing of use  can be made to res tore vigor to the units in those years of average or  above average growing conditions. Such adiustments must be based on  fi eld examination and requires application of the art of range manage­ment.  Three or F011r Unit Grazing Management  ~1ore intensive management and grea ter fl exibility in the alterna­tives  of management programs are provided with three or four units  that are fenced separately. Under a grazing program of this type, one  unit each vear is deferred from grazin g- through the growing season.  The ullit deferred is alternated among the three (or four) units each  vear so that once in three (or four) years each un it is deferred during  the growing season. The other units are aJternated between early and  late grazing during the growing season so that no unit is grazed at the  same time of the season in successive years.  Stocking rates on the Point Springs seeding have been about 2 acres  per AU 1 during the four years that a four unit program has been  tested. Stocking rate 0 11 these nastures used in the spring is between  3 and 4 acres per AUM depending on forage production and 1'h to 3th  acres per AUM in the fall. Almost any degree of grazing is permitted  in the fall except on the deferred unit. Ahout one-half of the forage is  left as carryover until the next spring when this unit will be grazed first.  Adjustments can easily be made in this program as required by  climatic conditions, animal requirements and changing management  objectives.  . ~ , '. '•.•. . I"" ~' ."" ' ...: , ~ , ' .r.  . , l.

Partridge  Poplars or aspens (Populus spp.) and particu­larly  some hybrid poplars are an important part  of special plantings in Idaho and particularly of  windbreaks in southern Idaho. These plantings  are unusually valuable and justify unusual means  to assure their success. Ordinarily, poplars in­cluded  in these plantings are rarely affected by  diseases or insects but sometimes a canker re­sembling  ""sunscald"" depletes stands enough to  render them useless. Improper handling, pruning,  or thinning often is responsible for starting or  spreading the disease and for subsequent tree  loss.  The disease appears on stems as light-colored,  often orange-brown or yellow-brown areas from  one to several inches across (Fig. 1.) Such areas  appear around pruned branches or injuries. A  slight depression usually accompanies the dis­coloration  so that the whole area seems to be  sunken. The general appearance is as though the  tree had been scalded in spots or extensively.  Close examination wiII reveal that the dead areas  inside such spots have tiny, black, pear-shaped,  ""pimple-like"" fungal bodies embedded just be­neath  the outer bark. These are smaller than pin­heads  but are visible in mass or when the outer  bark is peeled off (Fig. 2.) Frequently, reddish­orange,  hair-like tendrils coil out from the em­bedded  structures (Fig. 3.) These become num­erous  and more obvious in thelresence of mois­ture,  as during rain or overhea irrigation. With  time, the spots or cankers expand and grow to­gether  until the invaded stems are girdled. Then,  a general dieback of parts beyond the cankers wiII  occur.  Because the causal fungus (Valsa sp. = Cyto­spora  sp.) enters only through wounds, not  through healthy bark, the disease is more easily  controlled by careful handling and pruning than  by eradication. In order to avoid this disease:  1. Prune your trees sparingly.  2. Be very careful to sterilize pruning tools  after each cut.  3. Always prune back to the next branch so  that you leave no stubs.  4. Avoid injuring your trees with machinery,  etc.  5. Paint wounds, including pruning scars, im­mediately.  Use shellac on exposed areas of  cambium (e. g. where wood and bark join  around a removed branch) and paint ex­posed  wood (e. g. the center of a removed  branch) with tree paint.  If you find the disease in your trees, remove  and burn all dead or heavily cankered branches.  If cankers on the main stem are not extensive, you  may remove them by cutting them out and back  into the surrounding live tissues (Fig. 4), but:  1. Remove the dead or cankered area first  (b) .  2. Sterilize tools.  3. Cut back 1 or 2 inches into the surrounding  live tissues (a).  4. Paint the margin with shellac.  5. Paint exposed wood with a good ""tree  paint.""  6. Sterilize tools.  7. Clean hands to prevent spore transfers.  Tools may be sterilized by a few seconds dip  in alcohol, sodium hypochlorite, or mercuric  chloride but handle these chemicals very carefully.  They are dangerous.  UNlVERSITY OF IDAHO UBIt~RY  If cankers are extensive on the main stem, do  not attempt to cut them out. This will probably  reduce the tree vigor and increase the rate of de­cline.  Instead, cut the entire tree back well be­low  the last canker, paint the exposed surface,  Figure 1.  Figure 3.  Typical ""Cytospora canker'"" on poplar. (Ap­proximately  1/ 6 natural size).

Idaho's forest Products Industry  Idaho's Forest Products Industrv:  Current Conditions and Forecast, 2002  Operating Conditions  The year 2000 brought Idaho's wood and paper prod­ucts  industry the poorest operating conditions since the  1990 - 1991 recession, and the situation worsened in  2001. Virtually all segments of the industry experienced  lower product prices, with lumber continuing its extreme  volatility. The year 2001 began with the lowest lumber  prices since 1992. Prices spiked in May but dropped again  throughout the latter half of 2001 , reaching levels close to  January 2000 lows (Figure 1) . During the past year,  several major Idaho facilities closed, and curtailments  occurred at approximately half of the state's major wood  products processing plants, according to an annual survey  done as part of this outlook analysis.  Some factors that have contributed to sharp declines in  production, sales, and employment include:  o the national and global economic recession  exacerbated by the September 11 1h terrorist attacks,  o the expiration of the Canadian softwood lumber  agreement,  o a high valued U.S. dollar,  o continued low federal harvests, and  o high energy costs early in the year.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .....  figure 1  NaOlnWlde Clm.lsne lumber Prices  .lnthlV, 1990-2001  Price per  thousand board  feet lumber tally  500  400  300  '90 '91 '92 '93 '94 '95 '96 '97 '98 '99 '00 '01  Month and Year  Source: Random Leng th Publications.  figure 2  Sales Value alldahl'S Primary W.,d Products  1981-2001  Millions of  2001 dollars  2,000  1,500  1,000  500  '81 '85 '90 '95 '01  Year  Source: American Plywood Association; Bureau of Business  and Economic Research, The University of Montana­Missoula;  Western Wood Products Associa tion.

Estilnated forest industry employment was  14,460, a decrease of about 1,400 workers from 2000  (Figure 3).  Idaho's estimated lumber production was less than 1.8  billion board reet in 2001, down about 7 percent from 1.9  billion board reet in 2000 (Figure 4). Due to closures and  curtailments, plywood production decreased about 20  percent from 2000 levels. Weak paperboard markets also  led to temporary curtailments in November.  Boise Cascade Corporation permanently closed its  Idaho lumber and plywood operations in mid-2001 due  primarily to steep drops in national forest timber offer­ings  (Figures 5 and 6). For South Idaho, the closure of the  Emmett and Cascade mills will have substantial impacts  on local economies and demand ror sawtimber.  Among the positive factors for the industry have been  the declines in energy costs and mortgage rates during  2001.

Low mortgage rates have kept the nation 's building  activity at relatively high levels despite the recession and  poor consumer confidence. Poor economic conditions  through much of the world, a high va lued U.S. dollar, and  the expiration of the Canadian softwood lumber agree­ment  have made the United States the major target  market for softwood lumber producers worldwide. This  situation has lead to weak prices, a decline in lumber  production throughout the United States, and an increase  in imports of lumber from other countries, Canada in  particular.  Outlook  The outlook for 2002 indicates limited improvement.  The U.S. economy is projected to be in a recession into the  first quarter of 2002, and nationwide consumption of  wood products is expected to decline in the next year, with  worldwide economic conditions even weaker. Most of the  major processors in Idaho do expect overall operating  conditions to be the same as or better than 2001. This  appears more reflective of improvement in areas like  energy costs and other raw material costs rather than  expectations that 2002 will bring dramatically higher  prices.  The success of the campaign against terrorism, the  timing of global economic recovery, and the resolution of  the Canadian softwood lumber import dispute are other  issues that make for an uncertain outlook for 2002. As  markets improve in the longer term, timber availability  remains a major issue for Idaho's forest products industry.

Partridge  A dieback of the terminal and upper branches  of young grand fir (Abies grandis (Doug!.)  Lind!.), noticed on cultured and natural trees in  localized areas of northern Idaho, poses a serious  problem to producers of Christmas trees. The di­sease  badly distorts and may kill individual trees  rendering them valueless. It is particularly ser­ious  in Christmas trees because the pruning done  to improve form may favor its invasion and ac­celerate  its spread. The causal fungus (Valsa  abietis Fr. = Cytospora abietis Sacc.) invades  wounds and is easily carried by pruning tools or  by the hands that use them.  The disease usually is noticed first as a brown­ing  of the needles on individual leaders. This pro­gresses  downward for six inches or at the most  two feet per year. No other external symptoms  are clearly visible. Ordinarily, no identIfying  fungal structures are produced until two- or three­year-  old stems are invaded. Then, tiny, black,  pear-shaped, ""pimple-like"" structures develop be­neath  the outer bark and protrude slightly. These  are hidden by the rough bark, but are easily seen  as round black patches when the outer bark is  lightly shaven with a knife (Fig. 1.) During  moist weather, spores ooze from these structures  and are seen as yellow or orange, hair-like ten­drils  protruding from the bark (Fig. 2.) The limit  of each canker or dead area usually is not easy to  find, but can be detected by slicing off the outer  bark beginning in obviously dead tissue and pro­ceeding  down the stem. At the interface, brown  bark suddenly joins living, green bark (Fig. 3.)  Ordinarily, this disease affects only a few  trees and naturally subsides without treatment,  but occasionally individual stands or trees may be  severely damaged and some t rees progressively  killed. Thus, if this condition is common in a  stand, observe the rate of dieback before deciding  to attempt contro!. If the frequency and rate of  invasion decline during several months, do not at­tempt  contro!' Recovery probably will take place  naturally. Remember, control procedures cost  money. Unless you can justify such cost in terms  of future value, you cannot afford to repress mi­nor  losses. If decline continues, and particularly  if it continues rapidly in many trees, infected  parts or even trees should be removed. In any  case, pruning for form should be postponed until  natural or artificial control is achieved, because  the disease organism easily is carried from one  tree to another on pruning tools.  If immediate control is necessary, all dead and  dying branches must be pruned out not less than  six inches beyond the last vestige of each canker  (i.e. beyond the dead/ live interface.) The tools  used in pruning must be sterilized after each cut  to assure that the fungus will not be carried to  healthy tissues. A few seconds dip in alcohol,  sodium-hypochlorite, or mercuric chloride will suf­fice.  Sodium hypochlorite is harmful to eyes,  hands and clothing; mercuric chloride is a potent  poison. Handle these chemicals with great care.  Pruning should be done only during sunny, dry  weather because the fungus reproduces in mois­ture  and spreads r apidly during wet weather.  There is no satisfactory method of chemical  control for this disease in forests or plantations.  It cannot be ""sprayed away"" and money spent for  this purpose presently is wasted.  If you have this disease in your t rees, don't be  hasty. Wait to see how it progresses. Cease prun­ing.  If necessary, and only if surely so, prune out  dead and dying branches .

P. McConnel, H. Loewenstein. and F. H. Pitkin'  The vigor and even survival of planted tree  seedlings are to a notable extent dependent on fac­tors  relating to root development. The dearth of  information regarding such development may be  attributed to the difficulties involved in studying  roots (Kramer & Kozlowski, 1960, p. 53). The  successful use of radio tracers for root investiga­tions  of agricultural crops (Hall et aI, 1953) sug­gests  that this method may hold real promise in  forestry. The technique basically involves injec­tion  of a radioistope solution at specific locations  in the soil surrounding the roots of seedlings, with  periodic analysis of foliage following. The pres­ence  of the isotope in the foliage is taken as evi­dence  that at least one root of the particular  seedling has reached an injection site, and the  amount of radioactivity recorded presents an in­dication  of the activity of the roots in the par­ticular  soil zone involved in the injections.  Field studies utilizing the radio-tracer tech­nique  have been in progress at Idaho for several  years. Results of th is work will be published else­where.  The current report is concerned with a  greenhouse experiment carried out in conjunc­tion  with the field investigations. The use of glass  front boxes as soil containers permitted visual  observations of root elongation to be made concur­rently  with the radio-tracer determinations.  Procedure  The root observation boxes, 2 inches thick, 10  inches wide, and 30 inches deep, were of wood  construction with one glass face. Drainage holes  were provided at the bottom of each box. The  lThis project was partially supported with funds from the  McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Pro­gram  of the U.S.D.A.  Tormer Research Fellow, Associate Professor of Fores­try,  and Assistant Professor of Forestry, respectively.  boxes were housed in a wooden frame structure  covered with plastic to exclude light from the  roots. Supports within the housing allowed the  individual root boxes to be angled forward so that  roots would tend to grow against the glass, thus  aiding observation.  Early ·in January, 1965, the boxes were filled  with a fOrest soil, which was allowed to settle for  several days after moistening. Then the boxes  were laid in a horizontal position, the glass f ronts  removed, and two seedlings per box were placed  with their roots flat against the soil surface and  root collars even with the soil surface. Immedi­ate  replacement of the glass and subsequent  watel""ing permitted rapid growth inception. Dur­ing  the experiment, approximately 1 inch of  water was applied per week; a thin layer of ver­miculite  on the soil surface prevented puddling  during watering.  The three species used in the experiment were  2-1 Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)  Franco.), 2-1 Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponde1'osa  Douglas), and 3-1 Engelmann spruce (Picea en­gelmannii  Parry). Ponderosa pine roots were  pruned to 9 inches; the others to 8 inches. Sixteen  specimens of each species were planted, thus a  total of 24 observation boxes were required.  On January 11, the glass was removed briefly  to inject phosphorus 32, used as the radio-tracer.  The solution employed contained 15 uc/ml of  radioactivity. Ten 5-ml injections were made in  a horizontal band across the root box. Three {&gt;lace­ments  (treatments) were involved, with mjec­tion  bands 2, 6, or 10 inches below the root tips.  Treatments were replicated four times on each  species. Soil in boxes supporting four seedlings  of each species was left uninjected to help detect  possible physiological or morphological abnorm­alities  induced by the radioactivity.  Root-growth records of all specimens, as ob­served  through the glass fronts of the boxes, were  maintained in conjunction with records concern­ing  radioactivity.  Twenty to 30 mg of needles were taken for  radioactivity analysis from leaders and laterals  of each seeding at intervals of 1 week until visual  observation indicated that the roots approached  the radioactive zone. Then samples were taken  three times weekly until the radioactivity appear­ed  in the tissue. These needles were ashed accord­ing  to standard procedures and analyzed for  radioactivity with a Nuclear-Chicago gas flow  detecter system. Any significant time differen­tial  between root contact (as visually noted) and  radiophosphorus translocation to foliage should  have been recorded by this method. The data were  subjected to an analysis of variance to investigate  possible interactions between species and del?th  of isotope placement zone and isotope detectlOn  in foliage. Measurements of the radioactivity of  foliage were made periodically throughout the  experimental period. The total phosphorus con­tent  of the seedlings was obtained at the conclu­sion  of the study.  One Douglas fir and one Engelmann spruce  seedling were pressed and subjected to radio­graphic  analysis at the conclusion of the experi­ment.  These autoradiagrams were used to exam­ine  areas of high p:"" concentration in the plants  and to detect possible differences in distribution  patterns of the isotope between the two species.  Kodak No-Screen Medical X-ray Film was used  for the autoradiograms. Developing procedures  utilized were specified by the manufacturer.  Results and Discussion  Data concerning root growth rates of the  three species are presented in Table 1. While  four specimens were initially utilized per treat­ment,  one plant from each of two treatments died  soon after the work began. In a third instance,  visible roots of one specimen never did reach  the injection band. For these particular treat­ments,  averages are based on three plants, as in­dicated  in the table.  Growth inception, while slow due to the initial  dormant state of the plants, was actually not re­tarded  as much as these particular data might  indicate. Measurements are based on distance  from the lowest of the pruned root tips to the par­ticular  injection band. Most new growth, how­ever,  originated in the upper root system and  not at the pruned tip. Thus, while the most rapid­ly  growing specimen required 30 days to pene­trate  2 inches below the pruned root tips, this  normally required 4 to 8 inches of new root  growth. Douglas fir and Engelmann spruce seed­lings  averaged 30 days for visible roots to reach  the 2 inch line, and ponderosa pine was slower,  requirIng an average of 35 days.  Table 1.

The ponderosa pine roots reached the 6- and  lO-inch depths more rapidly than did the roots  of either of the other 2 species. For example,  ponderosa pine required an average of only 55.3  days for visible roots to penetrate to the 10-inch  line, while the Engelmann spruce averaged 81.5  days to reach this point. However, the fastest  growing spruce required 58 days, or only 8 days  more than the first ponderosa pine to reach the  lO-inch depth. This erratic performance within a  species can be accounted for by two reasons:  1. Only roots growing against the glass could  be measured. Some roots hidden in the soil may  have reached an injection zone before the visible  roots. Thus, the average time for a particular  species to reach an injection band as determined  by this method may be somewhat greater than  it was in actuality. As will be noted below, in  some instances p:"" uptake was detected before  roots were observed to enter an injection band .  This is further evidence that some unseen roots  elongated more rapidly than those against the  glass.  2. A second reason for differences in growth  rate observed within species has to do with in­herent  genetic variation. More replication than  was possible in this study would help alleviate  the effect of this factor.  Root growth increments were variable from  week to week (Table 2). Average growth for all  seedlings ranged from 0.90 inches per week to  2.5 inches per week over a 7-week period. The  analysis of variance indicated that ponderosa  pine roots grew significantly faster than either  of the other species. Only data from February 8  through March 22 were used to test for signifi­cance,  because several ponderosa pine roots had  reached the bottom of root boxes by that time.  Later data were biased as further measurements  of these roots were inaccurate.  TO CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS FLOOR  Table 2.

Detectable amounts of radioactivity in needle  tissue were usually found within a week of the  time roots of seedlings were observed to enter a  zone of isotope placement (Table 3). Twelve  seedlings (over 113 of those which lived through  the experimental period) had radioactive foliage  on a sampling date within a day or two of the  time visible roots entered a P"" injection band.  For the purposes of this investigation, detection  within this short time span was considered essen­tially  immediate, and time differential between  observation of roots in the isotope placement zone  and detection in the needles of the 12 specimens  is recorded as O. Another 13 seedlings developed  radioactive foliage either a week prior to or a  week after visible roots entered the placement  zone. Time differentials exceeded 2 weeks in only  five instances. One Engelmann spruce seedling  had radioactive foliage 6 weeks before roots were  seen entering the isotope placement zone involved,  and one ponderosa pine developed radioactivity,  although no visible root entered the injection  band. This situation can probably be explained by  Table 3.

Excavation of root systems  at the conclusion of the experiment revealed that  the ponderosa pine seedling mentioned above,  did, indeed, have roots within the soil mass which  had penetrated the injection zone.  Three seedlings had roots which were seen to  enter the isotope placement zone considerably be­fore  needles became radioactive. Apparently ab­sorption  of isotope by these particular roots was  low, and minimal quantities necessary for detec­tion  were slow in accumulating.  An analysis of variance indicated that the three  species involved behaved similarly in respect to  tIme differentials observed, and these differen­tials  were not affected by depth of the particular  zone of soil radioactivity.  Radioactivity analysis of needle tissue from all  seedlings were periodically conducted from the  time roots were first entering the isotope place­ment  zones until the end of the experiment. Data  concerning radioactivity of foliage sampled (in  each instance 1 month after the first detection  of the isotope in the particular specimen) are  presented in Table 4. Values are presented as ac­tivity  (expressed in counts per minute) per 10  mg of oven-dry tissue. In order to make the in­formation  from all specimens comparable, decay  of the isotope was taken into account. Thus cpm  values were adjusted to indicate the level of  radioactivity which would be present in the tissue  had no decay taken place since placement of the  isotope.  The tabulated data reveal large variations in  radioactivity present in the needles of individ­ual  specimens 1 month after first contact with the  isotope. Radioactivity was not detected at all in  several plants, although it had been present ini­tially.  Evidently these particular seedlings ab­sorbed  little additional P"" during the month in­terval,  and the P"" originally present had decayed  below a detectable level.  In spite of the variation encountered, several  trends appear to be evident. This is especially  true considering data involving only the seedlings  Table 4.

For Douglas fir and Engelmann spruce, the  highest levels of radioactivity were detected in  foliage from specimens growing in root boxes  which had received isotope injections at the 2-  inch depth. The most radioactivity detected in a  ponderosa pine seedling, on the other hand, oc­curred  where injection was made at the 6-inch  depth. Generally, more active absorption of P""  occurred in roots situated in either the 2- or 6-  inch depth placement zones than in roots grow­ing  in the lO-inch depth band. For example, 1  month after foliage radioactivity had first been  detected in each specimen, the total activity of  needle samples from the 4 ponderosa pines in­volved  in the 2-inch depth treatment was 1147  cpm (based on 10 mg oven-dry weight per sam­ple  and adjusted for decay.) The comparable  value for the 6-inch depth of isotope placement  treatment was 1908 cpm. In contrast, a total ac­tivity  of only 207 cpm was detected in the sam­ples  of ponderosa pine foliage collected from  specimens growing In soil injected !\t 10 inches  (2 of the seedlings from this treatment had no  detectable radioactivity.)  Total phosphorus content of these seedlings  was obtained at the conclusion of the experiment.  Values ranged from as low as 1320 ppm up to  4280 ppm in oven-dried tissue. The ponderosa  pine seedlings showed a lower total phosphorus  content than either of the other species, ranging  from 1440 to 1790 ppm. Engelmann spruce seed­lings  contained an intermediate amount of phos­phorus,  and the Douglas-fir seedlings contained  considerably higher amounts, ranging from 3290  to 4280 ppm. The amount of phosphorus added in  the form of p32 was negligible. Only 750 uc,  amounting to only 2.63x10-'o grams of phosphor­us,  was applied to each root box (except controls.)  Autoradiograms were made from one Douglas  fir and one Engelmann spruce seedling to locate  areas of high P"" concentration. The radioactivity  in both cases was very high in roots. In the foli­age  it was concentrated in all areas of meriste­matic  tissue. Older needles and stems contained  considerably smaller amounts of the isotope, as  indicated by the lower intensity of images in  developed film . No distributional differences re­lated  to species were noted.  LITERATURE CITED  Hall, N. S., W. F. Chandler, C.H.M. van Bavel, P. H. Reid,  and J. H. Anderson. 1953.

Wildlife and Range Sciences  1  .]  No. 7 February, 1967  Forestry, Wildlife, and Range Experiment Station  The Genetic Improvement of Ponderosa Pine in Idaho  By Chi·Wu Wang'  The Forest Tree Improvement Program in  Idaho is conducted as a cooperative effort of the  University of Idaho, the U. S. Forest Service,  State Forestry Department, Bureau of Land  Management, and private industry. Since its ini­tiation,  a decision was made by all cooperators  that the tree. improvement was to be concentrated  first on pondero'sa pine. In Idaho this species is  very abundant naturally and is the one most ex·  tensively planted for artificial regeneration. The  greatly expanded reforestation program of the  last decade increased the demand for genetically  improved seed and facilitated the establishment  of experimental plantations necessary for pro­geny  tests and seed orchards.  Ponderosa pine is well known for its hereditary  variations (Weidman 1939, Munger 1947, Mirov  et al 1952, Callahan et al 1961, Squillance et al  1962.) Preliminary results from a ponderosa pine  local variation experiment including seed sources  from Idaho and adjacent regions (Wang 1966)  revealed a considerable range of clinal variation  which strengthens the conviction that appreciable  genetic improvement can be expected by selective  breeding from a local population. It is hoped that  knowledge and experience gained in this project  will be useful to the improvement of other tree  species.  · Associate Professor, College of Forestry, Wildlife and  Range Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.

(CourteSY Idaho State  Forestry Department, R. A. Miller).  I. Objectives and Approach  The objectives of the project are: (1) to pro­duce  genetically better seed in commercial quan­tity  for local use; and (2) to gather genetic in­formation  and breeding materials to be used as  a basis for further improvement. Genetic infor­mation  essential for further improvement in­cludes:  inheritance data on the selected charac­ters;  sources and distribution of the selected char­acters  in the local population; and performance of  the selected progenies on different sites at dif­ferent  elevations.  The general approach is a form of half-sib  family selection. In essence, the present project  consists of three parts: (1) selection and testing  of the one-parent progenies from natural stands  in southern Idaho in four ten-replicate plantations  under different site conditions (Fig. 1);/ (2) na­tural  stands of superior parent trees, as recog­nized  by the performance of their progenies in  the above test, will be developed into seed pro­duction  areas for immediate seed production for  local use; and (3) conversion of test plantations  into seed orchards by selective thinning of the  poorer progenies and the poorer individuals of  better progenies. Genetically better seed will be  produced from cross pollination between the se­lected  progenies.  Initial selection was made in 1961 from natur­al  stands of ponderosa pine in the Boise and Pay­ette  valleys (Fig. 2). Experimental plantations  were established in 1966 for evaluation of the  selected parental materials. Steps for further  genetic improvement were presented in Wang  (1963) .  II. Field Selection of Parent Trees  Selected trees included in the progeny test  plantations were mainly from six counties in  southern Idaho, viz: Adams, Boise, Elmore, Gem,  Idaho, and Valley. They were selected from the  Boise and Payette National Forests and holdings  of Idaho State Forestry Department, U. S. Bur­eau  of Land Management and Boise-Cascade Cor­poration.  This is a mountainous country. Sage­brush-  grass vegetation occupies the lower slopes  and basins. Extensive forests of ponderosa pine  mostly in pure stands exist generally between  3000 and 7000 feet. They are replaced by spruce­fir  types at higher elevations.  The plan was to subdivide the ponderosa pine  region of southern Idaho into twenty subdivi-sions.  Each subdivision corresponded to approxi­mately  a Ranger District. The two best stands in  each subdivision were to be located one from  higher elevations (above 4500 feet) and one from  lower elevations. Open pollinated seeds were to be  collected from the ten best trees in each stand.  Seeds were to be kept separate by parent. A total  of 400 trees were to be included in the progeny  test plantations.  This method of selecting parent trees was de­vised  primarily in consideration of the group'  wise population structure of ponderosa pine. As  was observed by Curtis and Lynch (1957) and  Hallin (1959), the characteristic ponderosa pine  type is composed of many small even-aged stands  Fig. 2. Natural range of ponderosa pine in southern  Idaho (shaded areas) , and locations of stands of  selected trees included in the progeny-test. The  progeny-test plantations are located at (l) Idaho  City. (2) Jack's Creek, McCall, (3) Boulder Creek,  New Meadows, and (4) Holcomb Guard Station.  TO CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS FLOOR  which form a mosaic of homogenous units. The  natural stands were established in a fortuitous  combination of abundant moisture, cleared ground  and viable seed. Seed production of ponderosa  pine in general is sporadic. It was observed that  very little seed is carried more than 100 feet from  the edge of timber (Curtis et al 1957.) The effec­tive  range of pollen dispersal also is limited.  Furthermore, the difference in age class, time  and year of flowering, and the physical handi­cap  of local topography are all effective breeding  barriers conducive to the development of a heter­ogenous  population as evidenced by obvious phe­notypic  differences between adjacent stands.  These mosaics of even-aged stands are in real­ity  ""progeny-test"" stands of local population.  Each stand possibly represents the progeny of  only a few local trees that happened to be close  to a newly created forest opening and produced  seed in a wet year. The even-aged stands are the  ideal units for initial field selection.  The general guides for selection were as fol­lows:  (1) Selection was to be made on .the gen­eral  phenotypic characters of the even-aged  stands. Stand differences serve as a more reliable  basis of selection than individual tree characters.  (2) In this region of great topographical diversi­ties  there are inevitable site differences even  within an area of a few acres. In comparison with  volume growth, tree form characters are less  readily influenced by site differences, but are  important factors that directly affect the value  and quality of timber.  The parent trees were selected and cones col­lected  by foresters of cooperating agencies who  had intimate knowledge of their respective areas.  As a rule, cones were collected from the ""best  looking"" stands within their jurisdiction. But  not all selections are equally rigorous. The major  limitation was cone crop. 1962 was a moderately  good seed year. Seeds were available from 284  trees in 35 selected stands. However, even with  this limitation, the parent trees selected are all  good specimens of timber trees. They are all  straight and tall, vigorous and without visible  defects. The stands as a whole appear obviously  superior phenotypically in comparison with those  of adjacent areas. They vary from average to  slightly above average in growth for the site  class. Trees from higher elevations (above 4500  feet to 6500 feet) and lower elevations (4500 feet  to 3200 feet) and from the ""basaltic"" and ""gran­itic""  areas were about equally represented.  All the selected trees bore a moderate to good  crop of cones. Because seed production is the  major objective of a seed orchard, and inherent  fecundity of individual trees is known to be the  dominant factor in cone production (Grano 1951,  Wenger 1964), fruitfulness is an important con­sideration  in parental selection.  III. Establishment and Care of Progeny-Test  Plaptations  Seeds were sown in regular seed beds of the  U. S. FOrest Service Lucky Peak Nursery accord­ing  to a four-replicate randomized complete block  design. The plots are in four-foot, single rows  across the seed bed, and the rows are 12 inches  apart. Seed weight and seed size measurements  were made before sowing. Regular nursery care,  such as watering and weeding, was given. No  fertilizer was applied. Seedlings were raised to  2-0 stage for outplanting. Prior to lifting they  were labeled with numbered sticker tape and  root-pruned. The seedlings were then sorted ac­cording  to seed sources into four-seedling bund­les.  The seedling bundles were kept separate in  individual polyethelene tubes with the tips of the  seedlings exposed and the roots wrapped in moist  sphagnum moss. Each four-seedling bundle in­cluded  at least one labeled seedling. Th~ four-seed­ling  bundles were then divided into replicate  bundles. Each replicate bundle included one four­seedling  bundle from each of the 284 progenies.  The bundles were kept in cold storage until  planting.  The progenies were to be field-tested at four  plantations in southern Idaho. The planting sites  were selected to represent the altitudinal range  in which ponderosa pine was to be planted. They  were located at 3700 feet (Holcomb, Boise Nation­al  Forest plantation); 4400 feet (Idaho City,  Bureau of Land Management plantation); 4750  feet (Boulder Creek, New Meadows, Payette Na­tional  Forest plantation); and 5350 feet (Jack's  Creek, McCall, Idaho State Forestry Department  plantation.) The planting sites were on ponderosa  pine land with approximately ten percent slopes  of average or slightly above average site quality  in the granitic region. Other conditions consider­ed  in site selection included proximity to existing  roads, and the nature of surrounding terrain suit­able  for establishment of pollen barriers.  The plantations were established according to  a randomized complete block design. Each plan,.  tation included 10 replicates of 284 progenies in  four-tree plots, or a total of 11,360 trees. In ad-  dition to the above, each replicate included four  4-tree plots of ordinary local 2-0 seedlings to  serve as control. The planting sites were cleared  of stumps and brush, and plowed the year before  planting. They were disked and furrowed in the  spring just before planting. Seedlings were plant­ed  by hand with planting bar or ""little beaver""  power planter at the bottom of furrows which  ran in parallel lines ten feet apart along the  contour (Fig. 1). The four seedlings in each plot  were planted at five-foot intervals in a single row.  The 5x10-foot spacing was used in order to in­clude  more trees for the observation of juvenile  characters, and to maintain the plantation at a  uniform 10x10-foot spacing after the first thin­ning.  The first plantation was completed in mid­April  near Idaho City. The two plantations in  the Payette area were planted from the last week  of May (Jack's Creek plantation) to the first week  of June (Boulder Creek plantation) when the  ground was clear of snow. The fourth plantation  (Holcomb) was postponed to 1967 for further  ground preparation. With the exception of a few  marginal plots in extremely severe sites, initial  survival of 85 to 90 percent was expected.  Barbed wire fences were installed to protect  the plantations from grazing. Plot corners were  marked with large permanent markers. Progen­ies  were mapped and tagged to maintain their  identity. In the first few years after planting,  necessary measures will be taken for the suppres­sion  of gophers which are particularly destructive  to young plantations. Early thinning will only be  made when release from crown competition be­comes  necessary. Fertilizer will not be applied  to the plantations before significant between­progeny  differences are obtained. Thereafter,  the plantations will be transformed from progeny  testing to seed production purposes.  IV. Evaluation of Progenies  The progenies in the experimental plantations  are observed for evidence of probable genetic  variations. Measurements will be taken at regular  intervals and the data will be analyzed primarily  for between-progeny differences.  The initial survival will be recorded a year  after the establishment of plantations. The  twelve-month survival count is more reliable  and practical than year end count, especially  for the high altitude sites which were not plant­able  until the early part of June and will be  snowbound in November. The inherent ability to  withstand transplanting shock was reported in  southern pine (Beineke et al 1965.) Finding of  between-progeny differences in the transplant­ability  of ponderosa pines is an important step in  developing better strains for less favorable sites.  One of the most important properties of the  progeny to be observed will be their ""general  adaptability"" or ""vigor."" This will be measured  in terms of height, diameter, and periodic growth.  A number of other traits of economic importance  also will be observed for evidence of genetic dif­ferences.  They include stem straightness, stem  taper, number of branches per whorl, prolepsis  and @nma growth, size and angle of side  branches, multiple forks, epicormic branch and  other deformities, preferential browsing, and in­sect  damage and disease susceptibility. When the  progenies begin to bloom, the following traits will  be observed: age of first flowering, time of flow­ering,  abundance and ratio of male and female  flowers, periodicity of flowering, and cone and  seed characters.  The significance of differences between pro­genies  will be delimited by variance analysis and  multiple range tests. This information will be  directly useful in seed orchards. It will serve as a  basis for the isolation of superior progenies, the  selective thinning of experimental plantations,  and the recognition of superior seed tree stands  for seed production purposes.  The second set of analyses involves the deter­mination  of progeny-environment interaction.  This will indicate the development of genetic  characters in response to environment. Some pro­genies  will be found to be more adaptable than  others over a wide range of tested conditions.  However, in this region of diverse environments,  it is also important to delimit the possible clinal  or ecotypic differentiations in response to such  factor as soil types and altitude gradients. Fin­ally,  the best adapted natural variants will be  . selected for the different site conditions.  The third set of analyses involves the delimit­ation  of parent-progeny relationships and of juve­nile-  mature correlations. As early as in the nur­sery  seed bed, obvious differences in seedling  height are distinguishable between progenies. In  the Idaho local seed sources experiment (Wang  1966), there were included six seed lots of mixed  seeds from the same territory included in the  present test. Striking differences were observed  in height growth at the 5-year stage. In the  present test, selection of the tested progeny will  not be made until significent differences are ob­served  at the mature stage. However, juvenile  characters at various st,ages of development will  be recorded to ascertain the juvenile-adult rela­tions.  Future selection of characters with high  juvenile-adult correlation then can be made with  confidence at an early stage.  V. Conversion to Seed Orchard  The progeny-test plantations will be convert­ed  to seed orchards in a series of selective thin­nings.  The purposes of thinnings are (1) to fos­ter  the full development of natural forms of the  tested trees in an open grown condition; and (2)  to improve genetic quality of the stand for the  production of genetically better seed. A tentative  schedule of thinning is presented in Table 1.  Table 1. Selective thinnings of the progeny-test plantation at ten-year intervals.  Year No. of Progeny Approx. % Plot Trees Trees Sq. Ft.  Alter After of Progeny Per Per Per Plan- Per  Planting Thinning  Orignial Stocking 284  First Thinning 10 227  Second Thinning 20 85  Final Thinning 30 50  Thinning will be made by gradual removal of  all trees of poorer progenies, and poorer trees of  better progenies. Roguing of progenies will be  made on the basis of between-progeny differences  of full-grown trees. At the present, without defin­ite  knowledge of juvenile-mature correlations, the  final judgment of the progenies shall not be made  until 20 to 30 years after planting. The thinning  of the poorer trees within each progeny, however,  will be made in the first thinning ten years after  planting. The reason for this is that, in ponderosa  pine, clear expression of dominance generally  develops at an early stage. The mortali ty in  naturally regenerated young even-aged stands  of ponderosa pine within a ten-year period was  40.33 per cent in densely stocked stands (6,000  trees per acre,) and 26.25 per cent in moderately  stocked stands (4,000 trees per acre.) The mor­tality  was mostly limited to death by suppression  of trees in the smallest size clases (Myers et al  1961.) From the beginning, less vigorous seed­lings  are at a definite competitive disadvantage.  They soon will be over-topped and eflminated by  suppression.  In the first thinning at ten years after plant­ing,  two poorer trees will be removed from each  of the four-tree plots. The spacing will be con­verted  to a uniform 10xl0 ft. area per tree. A  light selective thinning also may be made at this  stage by removing approximately 20 per cent of  the tested progenies. This will include progenies  with obvious defects and the least vigorous ones.  The second thinning shall be made 20 years  after planting. The progeny-test plantation will  be converted to seed orchard by removing ap-  Removed Progeny Plot tation Tree  0  20  70  82  10 4 11,360 50  10 2 4,540 125  10 2 1,700 334  10 1 500 1,136  proximately 70 per cent of the originally tested  progenies that are less desirable according to the  progeny test. Each plantation at this stage will  include 1,700 trees of 85 progenies in two-tree  plots. The orchard will be heavily fertilized, cul­tivated,  and managed for seed production pur­poses.  Before the second thinning, most of the  trees will have bloomed and produced their first  cone crop. Observation shall be made on their  f lowering habit. Under natural conditions most  trees do not always bloom every year, and there  are usually considerable differences in flowering  time even between trees within the same stand.  In progeny selection, special attention shall be  paid to fecundity and overlapping flowering time.  The third thinning will reduce each plantation  to 50 progenies in 500 one-tree plots a t approxi­mately  34x34 ft. spacing. This arrangement will  provide the better individuals of the better pro­genies  with ample spacing for seed production  and full development to maturity. It will also  provide them with opportunity conducive to maxi­mum  outcrossing and minimum inbreeding. The  genetic superiority of seed produced in the seed  orchard will be measured in the second genera­tion  progent test. The estimated genetic improve­ment  was discussed in Wright and Bull (1963).  VI. Early Production of Genetically Better Seed  Twenty years will elapse before seed will be  produced in any appreciable amount from the  seed orchard. To meet the immediate need, seed in  commercial quantity will be produced from the  better parent trees and the natural stands of bet­ter  parent trees as recognized in the progeny test.  The latter will be done by developing the stands  into seed production areas. The stands are mostly  10 to 25 acres in size. The trees are within the age  classes of 50 to 150 years which are of prime seed  production age for ponderosa pine.  The first series of seed production areas shall  be devel.oped on the basis of between-progeny  differences observed during the first ten-year  period of progeny testing. Ordinary 2-0 nursery  seedlings of local origin planted in this area under  similar conditions were three to six feet in height  at five years after planting. At this age there  will be ample indication of differences in inher­ent  vigor and other characters between progen­ies  in the four progeny-test plantations. Further­more,  several ordinary seed production areas  have been developed in this general region at  considerable expense, and additional ones are  contemplated. They were converted from pheno­typically  selected stands without benefit of pro­geny-  test. Under this circumstance the develop­ment  of the first series of better parent tree  stands into seed production areas on the basis of  five-year progeny observation is fully justifiable.  Depending on the demand for seed, four or  more stands of parent trees that produced the  best progenies will be selected. Consideration shall  be given both to the superior performance of the  progeny in altitudes similar to the area where  the seed will be used, and to the overall superior  adaptability in all four tested conditions. Good  overall adaptability is probably a more reliable  clue to the inherent vigor at this juvenile stage,  and a very important character for tree improve­ment  in a region of great topographical diversi­ties.  The stands will be thinned to about 50 trees  per acre, fertilized and cleared of undergrowth,  and managed for quantity seed production. When  the ten-year and twenty-year observations be­come  available, the early selections will be verified  and new or additional parent tree stands will be  developed for seed production.  VII. The Long Range Approach  The practical purpose of the progeny test  plantations is production of genetically better  seed for immediate use. From the long range  point of view, contributions of basic importance  to further improvement are the collection of (1)  inheritance data of local populations and (2) bet­ter  trees selected in the one-parent progeny test  to be used for future improvement by two-parent  progeny test.  The inheritance data on parent-progeny rela­tionships  and juvenile-adult correlations will has­ten  the time at which future improvement can  be accomplished. Other inheritance data of basic  importance to genetic improvement include the  knowledge of sources and distribution of desirable  characters and the possible differentiation of alti­tuilinal,  edaphic or local ecotypes in this region.  If the selected characters as revealed in the pro­geny  test are concentrated in certain areas, then  the effort of future selection shall be directed  toward the most promising sources. Geologically,  the region covered by the seed orchard is divided  into granitic and basaltic formations. Trees from  these two formations are about equally represent­ed  in the progeny test. In altitudinal range the  tested trees were selected from 3200 feet (Rough  Creek, New Meadows, Payette) to 6500 feet  (Dutch Creek, Atlanta, Boise.) The genetic varia­tion  in the local population developed in response  to the selective pressure of environmental condi­tions  is further perpetuated by breeding barriers  such as phenological differences in flowering  time. In Boise Basin, for instance, some stands at  the higher elevations bloomed as late as three to  four weeks after the lower elevation trees. The  evidence of ecotypic differences within this region  will be indicative of the need for separate seed  orchards for each area in future planning.  According to long range planning the one­parent  progeny test represents Phase I (initial  screening) of the work plan (Wang, 1963.) The  local population will be screened in the field test  for better breeding materials to be used for fur­ther  improvement by a two-parent progeny test.  In the two-parent progeny test improvement  will be gained from the additive and non-additive  genes transmitted from both parents. More than  twice the genetic improvement and inheritance  information can be expected from control-pollin­ated  progeny tests than from open-pollinated  progeny tests in per parent tested. However, to  produce control-pollinated progeny from 284 tall  trees in their natural stands scattered over six  counties all in one year will not be practical, and  it will require much more commitment of our co­operative  effort than to collect open-pollinated  cones from the same number of trees. Under the  present circumstances, a scheme involving thirty  parent trees crossing with a few testers would be  an optimistic estimate to produce enough control  pollinated seed in a year for a progeny test of  similar scale.  -------------------------------------  In comparison with the present one-parent  progeny test and seed orchard approach the al­ternative  thirty-tree, two-parent progeny test  would not likely have included adequate superior  progenies to provide a sound basis for future  improvement. The one-parent progeny test, on the  other hand, will have isolated the better individ­uals  from the better progenies in a series of  selection from the local population. The breeding  materials selected will be all assembled in a plan­tation  and ready to bloom. The plantation will  be then used as a breeding arboretum for the  production of two-parent F, progeny.

Eighty percent, or 1,242 million board feet,  of Idaho's 1.56 billion board feet total production  was from the ten northern counties. This is gen­erally  the area north of the Salmon River. South­ern  Idaho produced 320 million board feet, or 20  percent, of the total. A greater proportion of the  production from northern Idaho was exported as  lumber than was that of southern Idaho. This is  expected with a higher human population per acre  of commercial forest land in southern Idaho.  There is a strong trend for Idaho lumber to  be marketed in the East North Central, West  North Central, and Mid Atlantic census regions  of the United States (Fig. 1). Seventy-one per­cent  of Idaho's lumber export is marketed in these  areas.  The data for destinations by states (Table 1)  points up the importance of traditional white pine  using areas and of major population centers.  States receiving the greatest volume are in order:  Illinois, New York, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. These eight  states are the recipients of 796,703 thousand  board feet, or 51 percent of Idaho's export.  This distribution pattern undoubtedly is in­fluenced  by the existence of four major East­West  railroads in Idaho. In addition, the major  distribution areas are ones in which white pine  lumber, an important Idaho species, traditional­ly  has been highly regarded. With the decline in  supply and quality of eastern white pine, manu­facturing  plants in the western white pine region  found a ready market in the eastern white pine  region where white {line wood is preferred. Later,  other western species gained prominence with  these customers.  Although Idaho is relatively close to the rapid­ly  developing western markets, only twelve per­cent  of its lumber production was marketed in  the other ten western states in 1962. This is prob­ably  caused by a combination of factors: a large  supply of similar species nearer this market, more  intricate rail connections to western markets, and  lack of a traditional preference for species pro­duced  in Idaho.  Utah, California, Arizona, and Montana were  the only states which received more lumber from  southern Idaho than from northern Idaho (Table  2). Montana is in this situation due to a center of  rough green lumber production near Salmon,  Idaho, which lacks rail facilities and trucks much  of its lumber to Montana points for processing.  A regional report covering the eleven western  states and incorporating these data is being de­veloped  for publication in the near future. It will  provide an evaluation of the impact of adjacent  states on the distribution pattern of lumber pro­duced  in Idaho.  TO CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS FLOOR  Table 1.

Partridge'  During a survey of tree problems, scientists  from the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range  Sciences, University of Idaho, examined Ameri­can  elms (Ulmus americana L.) in Boise, Idaho at  the request of the City Forester, Mr. Herman  Ward. On 10 October 1967 two had symptoms of  dutch elm disease and feeding injuries by elm  bark beetles which transmit the disease. Chips  from these trees were implanted on malt agar  slants in the Forest Pathology Laboratory, Uni­versity  of Idaho, on 16 October 1967. On October  23 these cultures contained mycelium and coremia  of Ceratocystis ulmi (Buism.) C. Moreau, the fun­gus  causing dutch elm disease.  This is the first reported dutch elm disease  in Idaho, and its presence is alarming. It destroys  the American elms which form an important part  of the ornamental and shade tree complex of our  communities. Once infected, a tree almost never  survives the disease and at this stage no spray  or injection will help. ""Control must start before  infection occurs. Infected trees must be destroyed  ""by removal and burning or burial, otherwise  they form infection sources. In addition, spray­ing  healthy trees to control the carrier bark  beetles is necessary to prevent spread.  Although control is costly, it is less expensive  than tree removal. Effective control costs ap­proximately  $4 to $6 per tree. Removal costs $75  to $300 per tree. The secondary effects of lost  shade, nesting sites and shelter for birds and  mammals, weather modifications, and aesthetics  usually are not included in estimates of dutch elm  disease impact but must be considered in decisions  regarding control. Simultaneously, the possible  effect of sprays on wildlife must be weighed. A  choice must be made between some possible bird  mortality or definite tree mortality and loss of  wildlife habitats. Communities and individuals  must choose to incur one cost or another--the  costs of control or of loss. Neglect of the prob­lem  means certain loss. The history of this dis­ease  in the United States has been one of destruc­tion,  not because controls are ineffective but be­cause  people are apathetic to its effects. This  is a destroyer!  The disease is recognized by the following  symptoms:  1. Progressive yellowing, wilting, and browning  or blackening of the leaves on individual  branches.  2. Flags of yellow against the normal green of  crowns resulting from the yellowing of branch­es.  3. Progressive decline of the crown as branches  die.  4. Brown streaks in the cambium and/ or outer  sapwood, particularly in ""flagged"" branches.  This is exposed when bark is peeled back on  suspected branches.  The disease cannot be diagnosed by symptoms  only, but requires laboratory culturing of twigs  from flags or immediately adjacent areas. These  must be living, not dead, approximately %.-1f2  inch diameter and 6 inches long, and preferably  should show the streak symptom.  lAssociate Professor Forestry, Pathology  UNIVERSITY Of IDAHO lIB~ARY",,,2014-09-03,2018-11-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/fwres/id/63,63,156.pdf,/fwres/image/156.pdf,fwres63

After starting 2002 with a mild  rally, lumber prices dropped steadily during the year and  fini shed below the lowest levels of 2001 (Figure 1).  Market demand for lumber continued to be strong as  mortgage rates dipped below 6 percent and stimulated  vigorous residential construction activity. Despite the  strong demand for lumber and the imposition of a 27  percent duty on Canadian softwood lumber, excess  lumber supply in the U.S. market resulted in continued  low prices.  The high volumes of lumber on the U.s. market were  due to a number of factors:  • poor economic conditions through much of the  world,  figure 1  NaUanwlde ComPlsne Lumber Prices  MonthlY,1990-2002  Dollars per  thousand board  feet lumber tally  $500  $400  $300  '91 '92 '93 '94 '95 '96 '97 '98 '99 '00 '01 '02  Month and Year  Source: Random Leng th Publications.  1111111~1~~ljiillililj~II~II~111111  • increased wood products manufacturing capacity  worldwide,  • a somewhat weaker, but still relatively high-valued  U.s. dollar, and  • increased average mill size and capital intensity with  higher fixed costs (and often debt) making managers more  reluctant to curtail production in periods of weak markets.  Large volumes of imported lumber in the U.s. market  came not only from Canadian producers but also from  producers in Europe and South America. It is estimated  that non-Canadian imports of softwood lumber in 2002  totaled approximately 1.3 billion board feet, representing  an increase of more than 250 percent in just five years.  Continuing declines in Canadian and U.s. overseas "",:ports  of softwood lumber have compounded the supply problem.  u.s. exports in 2002 are estimated to be 500 million  board feet, a decline from 1.2 billion board feet in 1997.  figure 2  Sales Value of Idaho's Primary Wood Products  1982-2002  Millions of  2001 dollars  2,500  2.000  1,500  1,000  500  o '82 '85 '90  Year  '95 '00 '02  All  Other  Lumber  Source: Bureau of Bus iness and Economic Research, The University  of Montana-Missoula; Western Wood Products Association.  o 0206 00824811 7 University of Idaho Library  Number  of workers  25,000  10,000  5,000  Figure 3  Empllvmentln Idahl'S Farest Prlduets Indus!rV  1969-2002  Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department  of Commerce; Bureau of Business and Economic  Research, The University of Montana-Missoula.  Idaho Industry Sales. Emplovment Production  While there were no major mill closures in 2002, the  last half of 2001 saw the permanent closure of several  major facilities in the state, due to a combination of  limited timber availability and market conditions, An  annual survey conducted as part of this outlook indicates  curtailments occurred at approximately 40 percent of the  state's major wood products processing plants in 2002,  These were in addition to normal curtaiJments for mainte­nance,  On the positive side, 45 percent of plants made  major capital expenditures to upgrade facilities,  Estimated total sales value of Idaho's primary wood  and paper products in 2002 was $1,65 billion, down from  approximately $1. 70 billion in 2001 (Figure 2), Idaho's  wood and paper products industry employed about 16,400  workers in 2002 (Figure 3)-a decrease of about 700  workers from 2001 (derived from Idaho Department of  Labor 2001 and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Re­gional  Economic Information System),  Idaho's estimated lumber production in 2002 was j ust  under 1,80 billion board feet, down about 2 percent from  1,83 billion board feet in 2001 (Figure 4), Estimated  timber harvest volumes a lso declined slightly from 2001  to 2002 (Figures 5 and 6),  Millions of  board feet  2,500  500 '50  II Idaho's Forest Products Industrv  Figure 4  Idaho Lumber ProdueDon  1941-2002  '60 '70 '80 '90  Source: Western Wood Products Association; Bureau of  Business and Economic Research, The University of  Montana-Missoula.

There also may be  slight improvements in international lumber and housing  markets.  Based on a survey of key industry executives done as  part of our annual economic outlook, two-thirds of Idaho  mill operators expect 2003 to be a better year than 2002,  with only 10 percent expecting a worse year in 2003.  Fifty-five percent expect increased sa les and profits, but  fewer than 20 percent expect a major product price in­crease-  about the same number that expect lower finished  product prices. Increased profits are expected to come from  increased production (projected by over 60 percent of the  respondents) lowering per unit costs. Also, 25 percent of  mill operators expect lower raw material costs.  Over 90 percent of mill operators indicate that the  general condition of the market will be a major issue  affecting their plants in 2003 (Canadian and or interna­tional  competition was mentioned specifically by 75  percent of respondents) . Approximately 50 percent list  limited timber availability as a future issue; with two  managers indicating expected increased availability of  timber. Other issues facing mill managers in 2003 include  increased fixed costs, health insurance costs, lack of  qualified workers, and the phasing out of CCA chemicals  for use in preservatives.

Wildlife and Range Sciences  t.,  1  . /0  No. 10 February, 1968  Forestry, Wildlife , and Range Experiment Station  Boards For Leaf -Cutting Bees  In The Inland West  By E. L. Williams  Efficiency in pollinating alfalfa-seed crops  and the recent rapid multiplication of the alfalfa  leaf-cutter bee (Megachile rotundata) in the In­land  West has caused a strong demand for boards  used by this insect as nesting material.  Although the management of leaf-cutter bees  is newly developed and changing rapidly, a recent  survey where the bee recently has been used in  the Inland West gave some indication of market  needs for the board.  The survey consisted of personal interviews  with entomologist, county agents, seed company  managers, and growers considered representative  of the five primary seed producing areas of the  Inland West.  This bee is native to Europe and Asia and ap­parently  was transported to the East Coast of  the United States prior to 1935. Its population  did not increase rapidly until it reached the Utah­Idaho  area about 1958 in its move west. Then  there were major increases in number and large  populations soon were reported. This probably  happened because the insect needs both alfalfa­seed  production and wood nesting material in  close proximity simultaneous with temperature  and moisture conditions which allow its rapid  increase.  Within the Inland West the leaf-cutter bee  now is used extensively near Logan and Fillmore  in Utah; Orovada, Nevada; Moses Lake and  Walla Walla areas in Washington; southern Idaho  from Burley through the Boise Valley and the  adjacent area of Oregon. The alfalfa seed acre­age  harvested and yield of clean seed for these  acres is shown in Table 1 as reported by the Crop  Reporting Service for the leading state and total  United States.

Although converting from alfalfa hay to seed is  easy and such change could shift sharply the sup­ply  and th us the price in a short time, probably  the seed price will encourage a strong demand  for at least one or two years.  Until now leaf-cutter bees have been used  principally where alkali bees previously were  used for pollination with relatively poor success.  The alkali bee is strongly cyclical so that there  are times when pollination by this insect may be  quite disappointing. This problem can be alleviat­ed  or eliminated by using leaf-cutter bees. Sev­eral  growers mentioned that they considered leaf­cutters  as primarily ""insurance"".  The leaf-cutter bee has caused sizable in­crease  in seed production in some areas where in­troduced  as a management tool. Growers consis­tently  report doubling or tripling seed crops when  leaf-cuter bees pollinate. This indicates that  considerable investment in bee culture and man­agement  can be justified by alfalfa-seed growers.  Particularly, this is true in areas where other  pollinators, such as alkali bees, are not available  in adequate or consistent enough numbers to ac­complish  reliable pollination.  The center of bee culture and board market­ing  has been in the Boise Valley of Idaho. People  from each of the other areas surveyed communi­cated  with people from this area and knew its  leading men in the field even though they did not  know bee-keepers in other areas. Although Cali­fornia  is the leading seed producing area, the  greatest impact from leaf-cutter bees has oc­curred  in the other parts of the West. Because  Idaho is the largest area of production, has high  yields, and is centrally located, it developed as  the center of leaf-cutter bee industry. This gives  southern Idaho unusual opportunity and respon­sibility.  The greatest volume of bee boards comes  from the Boise Valley area. The majority of  boards in use in each of the areas except south­ern  Utah were from the Boise area. Five of the  leading bee board producers in the Boise Valley  consumed 950,000 board feet of lumber for bee  boards in 1967. This probably constituted 250,-  000,000 holes. Based on 250 holes per board foot  Average Average  1966 1967 1961-65 1966 1967  420 460 46,040 44,100 44,620  355 450 14,485 12,070 14,850  445 590 12,381 11,125 14,160  470 620 9,525 7,050 8,990  140 190 7,236 4,900 5,890  380 440 1,930 4,180 4,840  202 241 133,090 117,984 114,814  and $3 per 2,000 holes, $350,000 worth of drilled  boards were sold or consumed by these five bee  board producers.  Seed producers predicted that the demand for  board in 1968 would double compared to 1967.  This is based on a proj ected increase of pollina­tion  by the bees, retirement of boards presently  in use, and elimination of soda straws as nesting  material.  There were repeated references to the pos­sibility  of exporting bees in large quantities once  the number of bees has been built to where there  are excess bees in an area. Other regions of the  United States and foreign countries have ex­pressed  interest in these insects. The natural  conditions existing in the areas using bees in the  Inland West make it possible that a sizable ex­port  business could be developed in the future.  The major concern of growers at present is  parasitism. A number of parasites work in the  boards and cause bee larvae mortality. This is the  reason for seeking different types of board for  nesting. Initially, boards were used like those  most popular today. To reduce the loss caused by  parasites, a grooved board was developed. These  boards were layed up in laminates to form a unit  of nest. The layers then could be opened and only  the good ""larvae"" removed for returning to the  field or marketing. Numerous growers reported  increased parasitism with the laminated unit due  to the parasite's ability to move through cracks  between the laminations. Poor bindings and the  size of opening between the laminates are re­sponsible  for part of this loss; but regardless of  cause, most growers now avoid using laminated  boards and use drilled boards. Some reported re­turning  to drilled boards to reduce labor costs.  To reduce loss caused by parasitism in drilled  boards, a plan of regular board replacement is  used by most growers. These people usually re­place  the board every three years although sev­eral  mentioned using it only one year. The board  is a small part of the total cost, and if drilled  boards remain desirable there will probably be a  program of replacing boards on a two-year basis.  Growers expect twenty percent of the good holes  to be lost each year by parasitism and other  causes. This means that a board used two years  will be only 64 percent operative and likely con­tains  parasites.  TO CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS FLOOR  Until now, several different types of board  have been tried. Efforts to duplicate nesting con­ditions  with a plastic have failed. Plastics are  more subject to bird damage and parasitism than  wood while failing to simulate wood adequately.  It is possible that a suitable plastic may be de­veloped.  The various types of wood board may be  classed as grooved, drilled, and push-out drilled.  The grooved board and some reactions to it have  been mentioned. There is considerable variation  in this board which may explain its poor accept­ance  by growers. Possibly, the grooved board yet  may be a good nesting material. The professional  entomologists generally favor this board and feel  it can be manipulated to reduce parasitism.  Drilled boards of two types are on the market.  The simplest is that which has holes drilled and  no further processing. This is the least expensive  board and the one in widest use in the areas visit­ed.  The other type is drilled and then a board of  about a half-inch thickness is sawn from the face  and back. These make it possible to remove eggs  from the board by pushing them out of the holes.  This facilitates cleaning and permits sorting the  good larvae from those which are parasitized.  This board does not lose a part of its usefulness  from additonal plugged holes rufter each year's  service. It has the disadvantage of requiring  more labor and added initial cost.  There has been considerable discussion re­garding  the best species of wood to use for the  boards and a number of species have been used  from time to time. These include Douglas-fir, cot­tonwood  sugar pine, western white pine, and  pondero~a pine. There are proponents of different  species but the hardwoods generally have been  found unsatisfactory and harder textured soft­woods  more difficult to drill. The previously men­tioned  soft pines, sugar and western white and  ponderosa, have similar characteristics. Each mills  well, is quite easily drilled, has good dimensional  stability when properly dried, is lightweight and  generally is available in the area where the board  is drilled.  Smooth holes are important. Rough holes may  inhibit the bees entering, damage their wings, or  cause .them work and time to clean up the holes  till they are satisfactory nesting sites. Time spent  improving nests is lost for pollinating. Each of  the soft pines is adequate in regard to smooth  holes providing they have been properly seasoned  before drilling and are properly drilled.  There has been considerable discussion of hole  size. Some support exists for 1/ 4-inch diameter  holes but generally the preferred sizes are 3/ 16-  inch and 7/ 32-inch. Some manufacturers are plac­ing  holes of two sizes in a board anticipating that  the smaller bees will utilize the smaller holes and  larger bees will go to the larger ones. Some be­lieve  that the larger the hole the higher the female  bee ratio, and because the female bees do the pol­linating  this could be important. On the other  hand, some say it takes more work for the bee to  make nests in the larger-holed boards so reduce  their pollinating time. Since there is some sup­port  for l/4-inch holes and none for 5/ 32-inch,  which once were recommended, and entomolo­gists  generally think the bees are getting larger,  the 7/ 32-inch hole probably will be preferred for  marketing at present.  Depth of hole has been an issue in the past  but there seems to be agreement that holes from  three to four inches deep are best. Shallow holes  reportedly have the disadvantage of a lower ratio  of females. Deeper holes may be so deep the bees  will not go clear to the bottom to build their first  cell.  All the growers contacted felt a good standard  size board would be six inches wide, four feet  long, and approximately 31h -inches deep. These  are handled easily and work well under most re­frigeration  arrangements without too many units  to handle. This board will have approximately 2,-  000 holes in it.  There is some discussion of what quality  board to use - select or high common type. Al­though  some growers reportedly think a select  quality board is required, none of those sampled  felt so. Any board with tight knots, well seasoned  to provide smooth drilled holes and seasoned so  as to be free of checks which could harbor para­sites  should be acceptable. Frequently, growers  found that holes near the knots, which apparent­ly  serve as an orientation point, filled first in  boards.  Aging of the wood after drilling seems to be  important. Several cases were cited of bees avoid­ing  new boards in preference for aged boards. A  number of growers reported buying boards in ad­vance  to allow for this aging. It is possible that  the newly drilled board has a repelling influence  caused by its resinous odor.  There appears to be an expanding market for  boards to be used as nesting material for the leaf­cutter  bee. Apparently this market will continue  to expand for some time to come. Bad experience  with grooved board forces recommending that  anyone entering the business should work with  drilled board while remaining aware of its poten­tial  replacement with a high quality grooved and  laminated nesting unit. The availability of pon­derosa  pine in the area where the leaf-cutter bee  is being used and its lower cost, make it advisable  to give first consideration to this species. The  producers of plank should remember the import­ance  of good seasoning. A small investment in  good seasoning pays well in better bee yields. Bee  board plank producers and board drillers should  give consideration to the bee's preference for  aged board. Some artifical aging may be possible.  In pricing as well as quality control, the bee board  plank should be treated as a specialty item. The  cost of good processing is a small part of total bee  cost and should be invested. This added cost  should be considered in pricing.  BEE SHELTERS  As part of this project, questions were posed  regarding the possible market for a standardized  field shelter for housing the bees. There was con­siderable  interest among the growers.  A variety of bee shelters are used in the field.  They vary from old refrigerators to small  shelters, the latter containing only four of the  four-foot bee boards, to large houses sixteen feet  long and up to eight feet high. Some are wheel  mounted, some skid mounted, some mounted on  posts placed in the ground. Some were even de­signed  for moving from the field by helicopter.  There is a tendency toward larger bee shel­ters.  This does not necessarily mean they be  fancy. Some suggested the simpler the better.  A standardized house probably should be eight  feet by four feet and at least ten inches deep.  Some growers prefer boards and some plywood.  While some wanted doors on the front to close in  the bees, others thought an open front was ade­quate.

H. Winward and E. W. Tisdale'  Taxonomic recognition of additional kinds of  woody sagebrush (Artemisia) in recent years has  re-emphasized that this is a difficult group to iden­tify.  People working with range lands, whether  as administrators, technical advisors or research­ers  have come to realize the importance of correct  identification in this group. This means recogni­tion  at species and often subspecies level, and here  lie the difficulties.  This report presents a simple and rapid method  to aid in making some of the more difficult sep­arations  in the sagebrush complex. It was devel­oped  during a study of the ecology and taxonomy  of mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata  subsp. vaseyana)."" Both thin-layer chromatogra­phy  and morphological characters are being used  in this investigation. During the course of the re­search  we found that the general fluorescent color  of a sample of Artemisia foliage under ultra­violet  light could be helpful in separating certain  groups. Young (1965) used this method for initial  separation of Artemisia samples, followed by chro­matographic  tests for detailed information. The  fluorescent extract method has been tested further  by the authors, and is presented here as a field  aid for identification of difficult species and/ or  subspecies in Artemisia. Although this is designed  for use with fresh leaf material, it works equally  well with dried leaves from the field or from herb­arium  specimens. The method involves placing a  few grams of sagebrush leaves into a clear glass  bottle. Add enough methanol or ethanol to just  cover the leaves. Allow the alcohol to react ap­proximately  one-half hour (addition of 5 percent  He! to the alcohol or heat from direct sunlight  will reduce the reaction time by one-half). In a  darkened area, hold a long wave ultra-violet lamp  (3660 angstroms) over the bottle and observe the  fluorescent color of the leaf extract directly  through the glass bottle. This may be done in the  field by using a battery power-pack or after re­turning  to an area where electricity is available.  Two general groups may be observed : (1) those  that fluoresce shades of bluish-cream and (2)  those that fluoresce shades of brownish-red.  Group 1.  Fluoresce shades of bluish-cream  A. tridentata subsp. vaseyana (mountain big  sagebrush)  A. rothrockii (rothrock sagebrush)  A. cana subsp. bolanderi (bolander silver  sagebrush)  A. arbuscula subsp. arbuscula (low sage­brush)  A. arbuscula subsp. thermopola (hotsprings  sagebrush)  A. longiloba (alkali sagebrush)  A. tripartita subsp. tripartita (three-tip sage­brush)  A. bigelovii (bigelow sagebrush)  'N .D.~.A.

Examples of the  use of this fluorescent technique are provided be­low.  The nomenclature follows Beetle's (1960)  classification. Other studies by Young (1965),  Holbo and Mozingo (1965) and work at the Uni­versity  of Idaho substantiate to a large degree the  taxonomic separations outlined by Beetle.  Suppose one wishes to know whether the dwarf  sagebrush of an area is A. nova or A. arbuscula.  Within A. nova are two color variants. One has  dark green leaves and the other is a more pubes­cent  and therefore gray colored form. The green  form is distinct and more easily recognized while  the gray form more closely resembles A. arbus­cula  and is easily confused with it. These species  are easily separated by the fluorescent method.  When treated with alcohol both forms of A. nova  fluoresce a brownish-red color while both sub­species  of A. arbuscula fluoresce a bluish-cream  color.  This technique also is valuable in separating  subspecies within the big sagebrush group. A. tri­dentata  subsp. vasey ana fluoresces bluish-cream  while the subspecies tridentata and wyomingensis  fluoresce brownish-red. Fortunately it appears  that the newly recognized subspecies wyoming­ensis  can be distinguished from the subspecies  tridentata by morphological characters, for the  fluorescence test will not separate these two.  TO CIRCULATE SEE  Ll8R.~RIAN THIS FLOOR  For plants lacking flower shoots, some diffi­culty  may be encountered in separating young  plants of big sagebrush from those of the dwarf  species. The fluorescence test will be valuable  here. Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis  and subsp. tridentata can be separated. from A.  arbuscula and as skill is acquired with this meth­od,  it will be possible to separate subspecies vasey­ana  and A. arbuscula (though both are in the  bluish-cream group) by the shade of bluish-cream  fluorescence.  Other species such as A. tripartita, A. cana, A.  rigida, A. rothrockii and A. bigelovii are readily  identified by their morphological characteristics  and/ or geographic location. Although useable, the  fluorescence test is not usually necessary to sep­arate  these species.  After identifying the more difficult sagebrush  species and subspecies several times with the  fluorescence test, one should be able to separate  them by their subtle morphological characteristics  alone and the test will be necessary only as an  occasional check.  Research at this University suggests that accu­rate  separation of sagebrush species and sub­species  has more than taxonomic value. In addi­tion  to distinctive morphological and chemical  differences, each taxon has its own ecological re­quirements  and associated species. These are im­portant  considerations for management of the  vegetation types involved. Differences are also  being found in behavior and palatability among  some of these species. Future study should pro­vide  more information on these differences as well  as additional taxonomic data.  Literature Cited  Beetle, Alan A. 1960.

Abstract  The radio equipment and tracking procedures used to gather quanti~  tative data on the movements and other acti vities of mountain lions (Felis  concolor) and elk (Cervis canadensis) in the mountains of central Idaho are  described .  Introduction  We must have detailed knowledge of a nimal movement patterns if we  are to expand ecological theory, preserve and intensively ma nage many  species of large mamma ls. In the last decade, descriptions of numerous  radiotracking systems appeared in the scientific literature (Barwick and Full~  agar, 1967). Wi t~ these systems researchers have a tool with a tremendous  advantage over more conventional methods (Sa nderson, 1966) of gathering  quantitative data on a nimal movements.  Most radiotracking systems were designed to facilitate the gath eri ng of  movement data from small to medium sized a nimals living in comparatively  sma ll home ra nges on nat terrain. Mounta ins have deep, narrow canyons,  bluffs, escarpments, and similar landforms which act as barriers to a weak  signa l from a low power transmitter. A low-power emission is necessa ry be~  cause of weight and battery life considerations. This, the long movements  made by large mammals, and the restri cted mobi lity of an observer in the  mountains were special problems which had to be overcome to make radio­tracking  an effective research too l.  In this bulletin, we describe the equipment and procedures we devised to  follow the movements of mountain lions (Felis conco!or) and elk (Cervus  canadensis) in the mountains and deep ca nyons of central Idaho. We believe  this equipment and procedure applied to the st udy of other large mammals  occupying similar terrain will provide sa tisfactory results.  Slater (1965:8 1) defined biotelemetry as "" . the instrumental technique  for gaining and transmitting information from a living organism and its  enVironment to a remote observer."" We were interested primarily in trans­mitting  signals from which locations and movements and other acti vi­ties  could be determined . This we term radiotracking. For our needs, it was  necessary that the tracking system function so that indi vidual anima ls could  be located frequently enough during a specific time to place observations on  a qua ntitat ive sca le with little or no disturbance of th e stud y a nima l.  A radiotracking system which wi ll function satisfactorily as a tool in the  study of an anima l's ecology must be based on the biology and ecology of that  animal. The requirements necessa ry to meet the objectives of the investi­gation  must be tra nsposed into specifications for the electronic equipment.  The requirements provide a framework from which the ecologist and elec­trical  expert can, through a j oi nt effort , evolve a workable system for the  field (Craighead et a I. , 1963).  A radiot racking system must include a transmitter with its power source  and transmitting antenna which are attached to the st udy anima l, a receiver  with its power supply, and a direction-finding a ntenna. After considering the  biology of the mountain lion and the elk, the terrain in the study areas,  elect rical problems, and a fter extensive testing (Hornocker and Seiden sticker,  1970) we produced , and used the radiotracking system described below.  Frequencies  Description and Construction  of the Radio Equipment  Craighead et a I . (1963) point out that the choice of a radio frequency  is a fundamenta l consideration in designing a radiotracking system since  the radio frequency determines the specifica tions and capabilities of the  tracking system components. Low frequency signa ls overcome shielding effect  of terrain but require la rge antennas; high frequency signa ls tend to bounce  and diffuse but require antenna sizes which a re more ideally suited to port­able  direction finding equipment. Two frequency ra nges were selected ; each  was considered the best compromise in light of the objectives of each study.  For the lion work, frequ encies in the 30 M Hz range were utilized: 30.05,  30.07, 30. 17, 30.19, 30.2 1, 30.23, 30.25 MHz. A permit for us ing these was  obtained from the FCC through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Frequen­cies  in the 47 MHz range were utilized in the elk invest igation: 47 .02 , 47.03 ,  47.04 , 47 .05 , 47.06 , 47.07, 47 .14 , 47. 15, 47. 16, 47. 17, 47. 18 :,\1 Hz. The per­mit  to use these was secured from the FCC through the Idaho Fish and Game  Department.  Tra nsmitte rs  The transmitter circuit (Figure 2) is a modification of the consta nt wave  type pulsed by a resistor-capacitor network described by Tester et a l. (1964).  From this basic circuit , 3 tra nsmitters were developed : Models 1 and 2 trans­mit  in the 30 MHz range and Model 3 transmits in the 47 MHz range (Fig­ure  3). The component parts for the transmitters are listed in Table 1.  The 3 models of tra nsmillers differ in effective radiated power (ERP)  and cu rrent drain with approximately O.S mw and 0.9mw ERP for Yl odels  I and 3 and Model 2 respectively. Models I and 3 have a theoretical ballery  li fe of about 18 months while the ba llery life of Model 2 is computed to be  approximately 9 months. A complete transmitter collar with batteries weighs  about 24 oz.

This eliminates  the need of backpac ki ng several tra nsmitters with various a ntenna circum­ferences.  Closure is secured by overlapping the antenna ends and bolt­ing  them together. Since the capacitance of the animal's neck and changes  in antenna circumference affect the tuning of the transmitter, final tuning  for maximum output is achieved by adjusting the tuning capacitor after the  transmitter has been fitted in place on the lion's neck.  The loop of Model 3 (47 MHz) is not adjustable. The meta l loop, 31 in .  in ci rcumference, was riveted to 2 ply, 4 in . wide neoprene-impregnated  belt ing. 1 After the tra nsmitter was fitted on the elk's neck, the tuning ca pac­itor  was adj usted for maximum output.  Nylon pipe couplings were used for the battery casing in a ll 3 transmitter  types but the arrangements of batteries differ (Figure 3). For Models I and  3, a nylon coupling ( 1.5 x 4.25 in) was cut into two equal pa rts, the ridges  were ground off and the two sections fu sed together with epoxy. The antenna  was riveted to the battery casing and the transmitter components placed  between the two ends of the metal loop. The tuning capacitor was placed on  the underside of the battery casing (Figure 4). For Model 2, the nylon coup­ling  was not cut but riveted whole to the loop. The transmitter components  were placed between the ends of the loop on the battery casing a nd the tuning  capacilOr was placed on the underside.  Initially we embedded the transmitter collar in dental acrylic (Mech et  al. , 1965) but later we achieved more satisfactory results by wrapping the  transmitter, battery pack, and a short section of the metal loop on both sides  of the battery pack in fiberglas and coating it with 840 system epoxy resin . .!  Small multist rand wire leads were attached to the batteries and left exposed  on most transmitters. The latest transmitters constructed for elk uti lized a  magnetic read sw itch embedded with the battery pack for greater moi sture  protection. An opening to the tuning capacitor was made by encasing it in  a plastic straw before fiberglasing.  Portable rece iver  A block diagram of the completely portable, double conversion super­heterodyne  recei ver is shown in Figure 5. The circuit diagram and the com­ponent  parts for receivers of both frequency ranges are shown in Figure  6. Ruggedly constructed , the receiver components fit into a 5 x 4 x 3 in . alum­inum  box. The power supply was 8 1.4 v penlight batteries (size AA, Ma l­lory,  ZM.9) which fit into the receiver's back. Component parts were  arranged as illust rated in Figure 7. Recei ver frequency ranges were divided  into crystal controlled channels. Receiver sensi ti vity was 0.1 mv; audio out­put  was 100 mw; the receiver with batteries weighed 34 oz.  The portable direction finder (porta ble receiver coupled with a tuned re­ceiving  antenna) is shown in Figure 8. The receiver was constructed wi th a  standard coaxial cable fitting (50 ohm impedance) for coupling it to different  antenna types. In addition , there were a headphone output receptacle a nd an  input rece ptacle for an exterior power supply. For ground tracking, we used  light 8 ohm headphones but in an aircraft an 8 ohm stereo headphone set was  necessary to exclude outside noise. Receiver operation was improved in cold  ambient temperatures by warming the power suppl y. This was done by  carrying a battery pack in a shirt pocket and connecting it to the receiver  when it was used.  7  I  I  I  I  I  I  I~  Figure 4. The arrangement of components in the transmitter.  Controls or the receiver include: ( I) a cha nnel selector switch, (2) a vol ~  ume control which comfols the power input into the audio a mplifier, (3) a  sensitivity control which regula tes the R.

The receiver cont rols were protected with a metal rim (see Figure 8).  Direction-finding antennas  Three types of antennas were used with the portable receiver: (1) tuned  loops which were auached directly to the portable receiver or mounted on a  8  Amp.

Block diagram of the receivtr.  special moveable bracket attached to a light airplane, (2) whip antennas  mounted on a truck cab, and (3) permanently stationed 3-element yagi an­tennas.  The loop antenna was a si ngle turn loop, 12 in . in diameter constructed  of 3/ 16 in diameter brass rod . It was tuned with a variable capacitor mounted  at the top and balanced to ground (Figure 8 and 9-A). The loop was coupled  to an amplifier circuit and after coupling the loop, this assembly was at­tached  to the portable receiver wi th a standard coaxia l cable connector  (Figure 8).  The amplifier we attached to the loop a ntenn ~ was designed by Hunger­ford  and Johnson (In press) and field-tested and improved during the course  of our in vest igations. By coupling this amplifier unit to the tuned loop an­tenna,  the ga in was increased by 15 db. The circuit diagram and component  parts for our modification of the amplifier and its power supply are shown in  Figure 9-B.  A tuned loop mounted on a mova ble bracket attached to a light airplane  was the key to tracking large mammals in mounlainous terrain . The  mounted loop is shown in Figure 10. In night , the shaft to which the loop  was attached on a hi nge was lowered and the loop was extended (Figure  11 ). Our bracket was a modifi ed version of one devised by P. Schladweiler,  Montana State Fish and Game Depa rtment (in litt .). The gain of this loop  was also increased by IS db with an amplirier modified to operate with the  loop attached to the bracket (Figure 9-C).  9  L"".\ ""I:: o "" _  ~,  "".  ~  ""-""&gt;  ~.,  ... ~  oJ-iii  i\).~  :,w;,:.,.""'-'  :~:~ p  1--°  ,, ~ ,,:; ~.ons  ',.'

The 3-element yagi antenna was mounted in a vertical position on top of  a 20 ft. rotatable mast (Figure 12). The antenna was a citizens band type  (Antenna Specia list Co. Model M_202 2) modified for use at 30 :vtHz only.  T he element lengths are: renector 2 16 in , receptor 184 in (upper half 91 and  lower half 93), director 172 in with 40 in between the director and receptor  elements a nd 53 in between the renector and receptor. The gamma match  was shortened 3 inches with an aluminum clip. This antenna had an origi nal  forward gain of 9 db and a front to back ratio of 22 db. The gain was  increased by attaching an amplifier to the gamma match (Figure 9). The am­plifier's  power supply was attached directly to the receiver (Figure 12 ).  A whip a nten na mounted on (he cab of a truck facilitated rapid coverage  of an a rea when an adequate roa~ system was presen t. A' base loaded whip  (47 ~1 H z only, ~1 0del ASPB-268 ) was used as it came from the supplier in  conjunction with an amplifi er (Figure 9-C).  Constructio n procedu re  In the account above our description has been such that a qua lified radio  technician working with the ecologist can construct the components of a  radiotracking system for a speci fic species of large mammal. \Ale have found  this to be the most effective and efficient working a rrangement. It a lso helps  to keep orientation toward the research problem rather than toward the  research method .  Attaching Radio Transmitter Collars  Final testing  Before a ttachment, each transmitter was tested in the lab a nd di sta nce  tests were conducted in the field to insure its proper operation.  11 •  A  B  c  ' 30 MHz- 28pF  47MHz - 15pf  lO MHI.- 28pf  47 MHz-IS pF  1l23)O  Re&lt;.'ver  S ..

Mountain lions  Mountain lions were captu red using trained dogs (Hornocker, 1970),  and were necessarily immobilized with an intramuscular injection of  phencycl idine hydrochloride ("" Sernylan"") administed by Cap-Chur syringes  fi red from a specially designed powder-charged gun (Hornocker and Wiles,  in press). A transmitter collar before and after it was placed on a lion's neck  is shown in Figure 13 (also see Figure t ). The antenna loop was padded with  split polyethylene garden hose covered with plastic electrical tape. As de­scribed  above, the loop was left open to be adjusted in size lO fit the indi vid ual  lion . 'vVe closed the loop by bolting the two ends together; tapi ng was com­pleted  after the collar was in place on the lion 's neck. Battery leads were  connected and soldered in the field using tape solder '"" and a kitchen match  for heat. The leads were placed against the end of the battery pack and cov­ered  with ""S-minute epoxy."" Final tuning was done after the transmitter  was in place on the li on by adjusting the antenna tuning capacitor and usi ng  the meter built into the portable direction finder or a sma ll fi eld strength  indicalOr. The final step was lO fill the end of the opening to the tuning  capacitor with silicone rubber.  The transmitter t:'pe we selected to attach lO a lion (Models 1 or 2) was  dependent on the data we sought. Tracking by ai r required a transmitter  with less ERP than tracking from the ground . From above, the va rious land­forms  characteri st ic of mountains do not act as barriers to the radio signal.  Hence, if we planned to gather information on lion movement from the a ir ,  we atta,ched Model t with its lower ERP and battery drain (longer battery  life) but Model 2 with its higher ERP was attached if we were to gather data  on day to day movements and activi ties from the grou nd .  We believe that with only modification in collar size and attendant capac­itors  transm itter Models t and 2 wi ll function satisfaclO ril y on other large  carmvores and med ium to large-sized ungulates.  Elk  Elk were baited with hay and salt into corral traps. Transmitters were  readied by closing, soldering and covering battery leads with epoxy as were  Figure 10.

After ca pture, each elk was  driven into a confining chute where it was tagged and then a transmitter col­lar  (Model 3) was slipped over its head (Figure 14). As above, the tra nsmitter  was tuned for max imum output. The opening to the ' tuning capacitor was  sea led with sili cone rubber.  Radiotracking Procedure  Tracking procedure  Instrumemed moumain lions were located from th e ground using porta­ble  direction finders and stationary 3-element yagi antennas. For the elk  work, a truck with a whip antenna mounted on the cab was employed to­gether  with a portable direction fi nder. From the air, we use a tuned loop  attached to a Cessna 185 ai rplane. The approximate line-or-sight trac king  di stances for different antenna types and different transmitters are shown in  T able 3. T he errective ground-to-ground or ground-to-ai r ra nge depends pri­maril  y on terrain .  To aid in the loca tion of in strumented lions from the ground,3 3-element  yagi antennas were placed on strategic high point s on the Big Creek winter  range, Idaho Primitive Area (see Hornocker. 1970). A portable receiver was  coupled with the yagi antenna and the antenna array rota ted. If a signal was  15  16  Figure 12.

We obta ined a bea ri ng by  bisecting the angle subtended by the t\\·o nulls that occur symetrica lly on  each side of the ma ximum lobe (Kolenosky a nd J ohnston, 1967). From the  bearing we moved toward th e a nima l and establi shed its loca tion at close  range by using a portable di rection fin der .  If we could not loca te a lion with the 3-element a ntennas, we sea rched the  study a rea wi th a portable direction finder, systema tica ll y checking each  major dra inage. The route traveled depended on terra in . Traveling ridges  was in most cases more erfective and easier than walking th e creek boltoms.  F rom a rid ge, 2 drainages could be checked at once.  \Ve used a truck with a whip a ntenna mount ed in the center of the cab to  search for ins trumented elk. \Ve li stened for signa ls while dri ving over the  roads on the C lear water winter ra nge. A whip has only limited directional  properti es and the actua l loca tion of instrumented elk was achieved with a  porta ble directi on finder once a signa l was hea rd.  When a signa l was det ected wi th a portable direction fi nder, the a ni ­ma  l's location was determined by rota ting the loop unti l' the point of  minimum a ura l signa l was reached or no signa l was detected . This point (the  nu ll) occurred at right a ngles to the pla ne of the loop. The null gave sha rper  direction than the peak. When a null was determi ned , the instrumented a ni­ma  l cou ld be in either direction. i.e. a 180 degree ambiguity ex isted .

Occasiona lly only one bearing was obtained because of topography  a nd anima l loca tion. In these instances we followed Kolenosky and J ohnston  (1967) a nd estimated the di stance between the investigator a nd the instru­mented  animal.  r\ va riety of data were gathered from a di sta nce but we also used the  portable direction finders to put us in position to observe a particular in­strumented  animal and other anima ls that it was with. Craighead a nd Craig­head  ( 1965) point out that th is may be the greatest asset of a porta ble radio­tracking  system .  From the ai r, our most effective sea rch pattern was to Oy an ever-widen­ing  pattern (square) at high altitudes above and beginning over the center  of the stli.d} a rea. \..vhen we heard a signa l, we Oew in a semicircle a round  the a rea and by rota ting the amenna and using the null we determined the  approx ima te tra nsmitter location. (For bearing reference the loop amenna  was aligned at right a ngles to (he handle on the movable sha ft.) VVe then  dropped to a lower a ltitude and approached the tra nsmitter location, at­tempting  to pass directly over the tra nsmitter . By adj usting the sensiti vity  of the receiver and making several passes di rectly over the tra nsmitter, we  were able to accura tely establish an instrumented anima l's locat ion. Instru­mented  elk were seen from the air in several cases but never did we observe  an instrumented lion .  Different body movements produce variat ions in the signa l pa llern  (Verts, 1963 and others). \-Ve used this va riation and cha nges in transmitter  location during an observa tion period to monitor a nima l act ivit y. A steady  signal pattern denotes a resti ng or unmoving anima l while an imerrupted  signal pattern is indicative of an act ive a nima l. A change in tra nsmitter lo­ca  tion indicated that (he a nimal had moved. This techn ique is qua lita tive  l~  and we plan to incorporate a motion transducer (Knowlton et aI. , 1968)  into the transmitter circuit so that animal activity can be quantified.  Data recording  When an animal was located we recorded the following information:  location, time, weather conditions, and habitat and activi ty. Data were re­corded  in coded form on prepared sheets. Data from these were punched  onto cards and summarized using a digital computer.  Bulletin Footnotes  I. McM:aster-Carr Supply Co .. Box 54970.

Howe  Professor, Wood Utilization  At the University of Idaho, the College of  Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences wishes to  be of service to the citizens of Idaho by playing  a greater role in continuing education. Last fall,  as a first step, a questionnaire was mailed to men  in the field to determine the subjects in which  they felt they had the greatest need for updating.  This station note reports on the results of this  survey and will be used by the College as a guide  in deciding what short courses to present in the  future.  The questionnaire was sent to all alumni of  the College who live in the eleven western states.  Questionnaires were also sent to non-alumni in  the above area, who held professional positions  related to disciplines taught by the College. This  amounted to 1329 contacts of which 456, or 34  percent of those contacted, returned their ques­tionnaires.  However, some alumni did not completely fill  out their questionnaires because they were work­ing  in unrelated fields or misunderstood instruc­tions.  Therefore, only 368 men returned question­naires  that could be evaluated. Of these 368 men,  60 percent were employed by government, 25 per­cent  by industry, 5 percent were in education,  while ""other"" employment accounted for 10 per­cent.  The questionnaire listed 48 subjects under the  following general areas:  Biological aspects of forest management  Technical aspects of wood utilization  Other aspects of forest management and  wood utilization  Range management  Fisheries management  Wildlife management  Each respondent was asked to select the ten  subjects he felt had the highest priority for con­tinuing  education and rank them in the order of  interest (most important first, etc.). Interest in  each subject was evaluated as follows. On each  questionnaire the subject marked most important  was given a value of ten, next most important,  a value of nine, etc. ""Total interest value"" for  each subject was determined by adding all of its  points on all questionnaires. Figure 1 on Page 2  shows these results. Also shown is ""average in­terest  value"" which is ""total interest value"" divid­ed  by the number who rated the subject. Figure  1 reflects the fact that a high percent of our  alumni work in the area of forest management.  The same procedure was used to rank the  method of learning that the respondents felt  would best meet their needs. The results are  shown below, listed in order of decreasing pref­erence.  Short courses (3 days -1 week)  Short courses (1 - 2 days)  Short courses (2 - 3 weeks)  On the job training  Correspondence courses  Distance that the respondents lived from Mos­cow  was reported as follows:  Percent of  Respondents  85  6  3  3  3  Distance from  Moscow (miles)  100+  76-100  51-75  26-50  0-25  In spite of the respondents' long distance from  Moscow, ""time"" was rated as the most important  factor influencing participation in continuing edu­cation.  ""Distance"" ranked next, while ""cost"" was  considered the least important of these three  factors.  ."".  2  ~ :::OJ  00 ::!  !it  a ~l:II ::::  t:::)  !:=  CX1  ;~;.r. ..  :;;cJ -&lt;  SUBJECTS Average  Interest Value  Communications (1157) I 7.2  Logging-forest engineering (1007) J 6.4  Employee training and development (923) I 6.0  Watershed management (905) I 5.8  Silvicultural practices (812) I 6.1  Forest recreation (780) I 5.3  Forest soils (744) I 6.1  Wildlife habitat manipulation (665) I 5.2  Data processing (653) I 5.7  Management information systems (615) I 6.0  Range-soil relationships (600) I 6.3  Wood waste utilization (544) I 5.3  Forestation (537) 5.7  Production planning and control (500) I 5.6  Fisheries management practices (479) 4.5  Wildlife management practices (479) 4.7  Forest genetics - tree improvement (475) 5.8  Wood products development (470) 5.7  Wildlife-range relationships (422) I 5.0  Forest products marketing (407) I 5.6  I I I o 300 600 900 1200  Total Interest Value  Figure 1.

G. Wall. Jr. and H. Loewenstein'  INTRODUCTION  Very limited information is available concerning  the relationship of soils to forest sIte qualIty III Ida­ho.  Yet more than two-fifths of the State is forested  (Wilson. 1962 ), with the forest industry second only  to agriculture in economic importance. Successful  management of this resource wIll reqUIre among  other things an abIlIty to predIct, for a gIven specIes  and area, the volume of timber available at future  dates.  Investments in forest management are usually  nstly and must be based on rather accurate figures  o expected future yields. Current methods of forest  site quality evaluation require well-stocked stands  of the desired species to be present on the sIte. In  situations where land is poorly stocked, stocked  with undesirable species or without trees present  to indicate the quality of the land, an appraIsal  is difficult, not only for purposes of timber iJroduc­tion  but also for taxes, land sale and ChOOSIllg the  best land use.

The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Dr"" A. R. . Stage,  USFS, who provided site quality data and valuable advice durmg the  course of the study.  tivity can be more clearly understood if a sllecific  investigation is confined to a partIcular specIes as  it grows on soil derived from only one kind of parent  material. The current study Illvolves Just such an  investigation, grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl.)  Lindl. ) productivity being related to topographIc  factors and certain properties of soils having a spo­dic  horizon heavily influenced by volcanic ash. The  spodic horizon is defined by the Soil Survey Staff  (1967 ) as  "" . . . one in which active amorphous mater­ials  composed of organic matter and alumi­num,  with or without iron, have precipita­ted.  The term "" active"" is used here to de­scribe  material having high exchange ca­pacity,  large surface area, and high water  retention . ""  Plots and information concerning grand fir pro­ductivity  were supplied by Albert Stage, Principal  Mensurationist U.S. Forest ServIce, Intermoun­tain  Forest and Range Experiment Station. This in­fOl  mation provided two measures of sIte qualIty:  (1) site index (Stage, 1959) whIch IS the relatIO~­ship  of tree height to age of the dominant tre.es III  a stand and is expressed as total heIght at an Illdex  age of fifty years, and (2 ) a productivity rating, q,  which Stage (1966) expressed as the current annual  increment divided by an expression that adjusts cur­rent  annual increment for the varying growth po-  0:::  .w 0  ..u 0 :n u--l  ~ ~ ~ :x::  S I-  ~ Z ex:  0:::  0  ct:  0:::  l- eo  -l  .  tential of stands of different stages of development  and levels of stocking. A q value of 1.0 would indi­cate  average site quality,while a q of 1.4 means the  site is capable of producing 40 percent more wood  than the average site. Also a q of 0.5 means that the  site is 50 percent less productive than the average  site. The q value was considered by Stage to be su.­perior  to site index in its ability for predicting  growth for several reasons. First, q accounts for the  influence of site quality on height growth and stock­ing,  while site index represents only the factors that  affect height growth of individual trees. Secondly,  the productivity rating procedure allows purposeful  selection of plots to cover a range of sizes, ages, and  densities. Lastly, q measures the site potential di­rectly  in physical units of wood production. By tak­ing  each or these measures of site quality as de­pendent  variables and the soil and topographic  variables as independent variables the relationships  between them was studied with the aid of multiple  regression analysis.  LOCA TlON AND SOILS OF STUDY AREA  The center of the study area lies approximately  fifteen miles northeast of Moscow, Idaho and is  bounded by the towns of Harvard, Emida, Clarkia,  Elk River and Bovill. The area is within the North­ern  Rocky Mountain Province bordering on the Tri­state  Uplands Section of the Columbia Plateau  Province as based on the map of Ross and Forres­ter  (1958). The mountains are in a youthful stage  with V shaped slopes and rounded ridge tops.  Volcanic ash was deposited on top of pre-existing  soils in the study area approximately 6600 years  ago Wryxell, 1965) and has been retained because of  the protective influence of the coniferous forest. The  depth of this deposit varied from twelve to thirty  inches. As a consequence a new soil profile devel­oped  with the majority of plant roots concentrated  in the ash horizon. The following soil profile descrip­tion  from Plot No. 159, T42N, RIW, Section 15, Boise  Meridian is representative of the soils in this study:  Horizon  01  02  821ir  S22ir  lIel  1IC2  Depth  I ._I,~ in.

The buried portion of these soils developed from  Pre-Cambrian meta-sedimentary rocks of the Belt  Series. The Belt Series is of marine origin, distri­buted  over 65,000 square miles in Montana, Idaho,  and eastern Washington and constitutes a thick  unit composed mainly of argillaceous and quartizi­tic  rocks with subordinate amounts of calcareous  rocks (Ross and Forrester, 1958).  METHODS  Field Study and Sampling  Thirty of the original plots used by Stage were re­located  and a soil pit excavated to expose all soil  horizons. Twenty-four of these plots had a spodic  soil horizon and were used for this study.  The following variables were recorded on each  plot : (1) native vegetation, according to Dauben­mire's  classification (Daubenmire, 1952); (2) micro­relief  ; (3) slope, measured in percent with an ab­ney  ; (4) aspect, recorded in eight quadrants; and  (5) elevation to the nearest one hundred feet. The  profile description, based on the standards in the  Soil Survey Manual (1951 ), consisted of horizon  designation and the depth, boundary characteris­tics,  dry and moist color (using the Munsell nota­tion  ), and structure of each horizon. When possible  each horizon was sampled for bulk density using a  core sampler. A sample from each mineral horizon  in a profile was collected and air dried in a green­house.  The samples were then sieved and the less  than 2 mm fraction collected for laboratory analy­ses  of various physical and chemical properties of  the soils.  A multiple regression analysis was employed to  evaluate the 38 variables involved in this study.  Use of a computer greatly facilitated the multiple  regression computations.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Site index may be defined as the relationship of  height to age of the dominant trees in a stand and is  usually expressed as total height at an index age  such as 50 or 100 years. The term is widely used to  compare stands and site quality. Site index of the  particular plots used in this study were determined  by Stage and ranged from 36 to 74. The values en­compassed  the entire range of site indexes found on  all 151 of his plots.  The relative productivity rating, q, proposed by  ~tage was obtained by dividing the current volume  increase in cubic feet per acre per year of a stand  by an expression that accounted for the varying  growth potential of stands of differential levels  of stocking and stage of development. The current  study included plots encompassing the entire range  of q, from 0.59 to 1.61, found by Stage.  The bisequum soil profiles sampled in this inves­tigation  developed from the deposition of volcanic  ash over pre-existing soils. Horizon development  within the ash deposit was weakly expressed, with  only 2 horizons , B2lir and B22ir, observable in the  field . Separation of these horizons was based on  moist color, because there were no apparent dif­ferences  in texture or structure.  The difference in bulk density between the B2ir  horizons and those of the pre-existing soils ap­parently  was the reason that vegetation roots rarely  penetrated deeper than the boundary between the  ash deposit and pre-existing soils. Bulk density  samples were collected on 14 of the 24 plots. Bulk  density of the B2ir horizons averaged 0.753 with a  range from 0.480 to 1.093, while that of pre-existing  soils averaged 1.391 with a range from 1.261 to 1.548.  While bulk density of the pre-existing soils was not  unusually high, the difference in bulk density prob­ably  caused plant roots to remain within the less  dense B2ir horizons above. The B2ir horizons would  thus have the greatest effect upon tree growth,  and the statistical analyses were limited to exa­mination  of the properties of these horizons and to  the topographic data.

The first 5 variables formed a  regression equation that accounted for 68.75 percent  of the variability in site index with a standard error  of estimate of 5.302. The addition of 5 more var­iables  produced an equation which accounted for  77.63 percent of the variation in site index. How­ever,  there was no concurrent improvement in the  standard error 01 estimate because the added var­iables  had coefficients not significantly different  from O. Thus the equation formed by the first 5 var­iables  was :  SI = 12.6780 - 7.9435 (moist hue B2lir) + 10.9778  (moist hue B22ir)  + 10.5889 (moist value B21) + 4.0432 (K of B2lir  + K .of B22ir)  + 0.2278 ( % sand B2lir - 0.4081 (% silt B22ir ).  Three other combinations of variables were found  that would predict site index with slightly less ef­ficiency  but do not require laboratory analysis.  The equations are as follows:  1. SI = 62.5307 - 4.6704 (sin azimuth ) + 2.7372 (cos  azimuth) -  0.0084 (elev.) + 0.3196 (%slope ) + 0.0791  (thickness B2lir)  + 0.6249 (thickness of B22ir).

R'=0.5578  Standard error of estimate 6.130  The best regression fit of q was obtained with the  equation:  q = -0.2029 + 0.0199 (thickness of ash deposit ) +  0.1715 (dry value (B21ir) - 0.1710 (dry value  B22ir) + 0.3307 (dry chroma B2lir) - 0.1436 (dry  chorma B22ir) + 0.0326 (Ca of B21ir + Ca of  B22ir).  R' ;O.7041  Standard error of estimate 0.1542  These combinations of variables were regarded  as the best to be obtained at the present time. An  effort was made to use variables that influence  site quality. The effects of topography, depth, tex­ture,  and color of soil on site quality were strong­ly  demonstrated by their appearance in every re­gression  on site index and q. The appearance of Ca  and K in the regressions should be interpreted with  caution because the actual quantity of these cations  required by trees has not been established. How­ever,  they should not be ignored because the level of  exchangeable Ca and K in soil does give an indica­tion  of the nutrient status of the site.  The equations presented offer an investigator a  wide choice of variables, many of which are easily  observed in the field , for estimating site quality of  grand fir on volcanic ash soils in northern Idaho.  ....

S. Scheidt and E. W. Tisdale 2  Curl·leaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius  Nun.) is recognized as an important shrub species in Idaho  and much of the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain  region. Ecologically, it is one of the dominants of the  mountain shrub zone (Mountain Mahogany - Oak Scrub  of Kuchler 1964). This evergreen shrub is considered a  choice species as winter forage for hig game, including  elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep and Rocky Mountain  goats. It is used only slightly by domestic livestock, and  most of the stands occur at elevations above those of win·  ter ranges for livestock (U.S. Forest Service 1937, Smith  1957).  Uespite its abundance, wide distribution and  importance as browse, curl-leaf mountain mahogany has  received relatively little study. Observations from land  managers in recent years have indicated that many stands  of this species are in poor condition. Two problems  mentioned commonly are (1) lack of reproduction and (2)  low browse production due to concentration of foliage in  the upper parts of older plants (Mitchell 1951 ).  The present study was designed to obtain information  on the distribution of mountain mahogany in the state, the  nature of the stands, and certain life history features  including seedling establishment and mortality. Field  work was conducted during portions of 1967 and 1968.  Initial reconnaissance of areas where mountain  mahogany occurs was followed by sampling of 17  representative stands in five regions where this species was  abundant. Density, diameter (ankle height), crown area  and height were recorded for all stems of mountain  mahogany, as well as counts of other shrubs, frequency of  herbaceous species, and counts of mountain mahogany  seedlings. Three plots each 50 feet in diameter were  sampled at each site for the data on mountain mahogany  and other woody species, while frequency and seedling  counts were made on 20 one-by-two foot microplots.  Woven wire cages, 4 feet square and 2 feet in height were  used to protect mountain mahogany seedlings at 2 sites  from grazing by large animals. One· half of each cage was  ~ further enclosed by finer mesh wire to exclude mice and  . \ S other small rodents.  Mountain mahogany proved to have a wide, but  scattered distribution in the southern part of the state. The  principal area of importance IS In the drainage of the  Salmon River , but sizeab le stands occur in the  southwestern, south central and southeastern portions  (Fig. 1). :Vlost stands occur at moderate to high elevations  (3600-8000 feet ), except in the Riggins area where the  species occurs as low as t 500 feet above sea level.  The zonal position of mountain mahogany lies between  the grassland or sagebrush-grass vegetation of the plains  and lower slopes and the forest zones of ponderosa pine or  Douglas-fir. In many areas mountain mahogany was  found alternating with stands of sagebrush-grass or  forest. In these cases the mountain mahogany was  usually confined to areas of rocky or immature soils,  while the other communities occupied areas of finer and  better developed soils.  Most of the mountain mahogany was found in  relatively pure stands so far as the overstory was  concerned. Number of stems averaged 427 per acre, with  an average of two stems per plant. The average height was  9.1 feet, and canopy cover averaged 55 per cent. Ages  ranged up to at least 150 years; but stems older than this  had rotten cores which made accurate aging impossible.  The understory vegetation varied considerably with site  and past use. The principal shrub was snow berry  (Symphoricarpos albus and S. oreophilus), with moun­tain  big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. vasey­ana),  and green rabbitbrush (Chrysolhamnus viscidi·  floTus) occurring in lesser amounts. Snow berry occurred  in 16 of the 17 stands sampled, sagebrush in 9, and  rabbitbrush in 10.  The principal herbaceous species was bluebunch  wheatgrass (Agropyron spicalum) which occurred in all  t 7 sites, with an average frequency of 61 per cent. Other  common grasses include Sandberg bluegrass (Poa  sandbergii), Idaho fescue (Fesluca idahoensis) and  Columbia needlegrass (Stipa columbiana). The major  grass invader was cheatgrass (Bromus teelorum).

Sites indicated by crosses were selected for de­tailed  study.  species occurred in 9 of the 17 sites, and was abundant only  on sites where grazing and trampling disturbance had been  severe on south and west slopes.  Many species of forbs were found , but few occurred  abundantly, and the majority were of low forage value.  Common species of good forage value included hawksbeard  (Crepis acuminata), balsam root (Balsamorhiza sagillata)  and groundsel (Senecio integerrimus). Most of the  herbaceous species were those found also in adjacent  sagebrush- grass or grassland communities.  Reproduction and seedling survival in mountain  mahogany was evaluated by counts of seedlings of this  species at all 17 sites, plus repeated observations of  individually marked seedlings at two sites on both  unprotected plots and plots protected from grazing.  utilization were common. The first was the ""basket­ball""  form, almost circular in shape, from close crop­ping  since the juvenile stage. Such plants were only  3 to 4 feet tall at 60 to 70 years of age. The other growth  form the ""umbrella"" was characterized by 3 stem  almost devoid of branches or foliage , and topped by a  relatively small crown. Such plants had grown to a height  where their tops were above normal grazing height, and  once this condition was attained , they continued to grow,  but produced virtually no available forage. Studies by  Thompson (1970) in Utah and results of administrative  studies on the Sawtooth National Forest in Idaho indicate  that top pruning may be a solution to this latter problem.  Another biotic influence on mountain mahogany is that  of insects. Several infestations of tent caterpillars  (Malacosoma sp.) and spiny si lk worms (Hemileuca sp. )  were observed in the two years of the study. In some cases,  younger plants, two to four feet in height, were observed to  be almost completely defoliated. Such attacks would  weaken these plants, and if repeated in the following year  would be sufficient to kill them. On Juniper Mountain, in  Owyhee County, southwestern Idaho, an infestation of a  measuring worm (Anacamptodes clivinaria) killed over  half of the mountain mahogany plants in a large area  (Furniss and Barr 1967). Similar attacks by this insect  have not been observed elsewhere and may be restricted to  sites with rich and well developed soils such as charac­terize  theJuniper Mountain site.  Evidence of fire in the mountain mahogany stands  examined was scant, but fire may be a more important  factor for this species than the obvious signs would  indicate. One known burn in the Mackay area revealed no ·  charcoal in the soil and only the rema ins of a few dead  mountain mahogany plants to indicate that a fire had  occurred, This fire was dated as occurring 71 years ago  and mountain mahogany plants in the regenerated stand  ranged from 8 to 54 years in age, indicating a lag of about  17 years before restocking of the stand began. Another  stand, burned in 1965, showed no sign of mountain  mahogany regeneration by 1968, and the fire had left very  few remains of the previous stand.  In conclusion, it appears that mountain mahogany is  well adapted to the sites it currently occupies in Idaho. It  produces seed abundantly in most years, and the rate of  seedling emergence is high . In spite of heavy seedling  mortality due to natural causes , it appears that  reproduction would be ample in stands where grazing was  not excessive. The major problem in most stands is  excessive utilization , mainly by mule deer and other big  game. Rabbits and possibly some rodents are an important  contributing factor for damage in some areas. Use by  domestic livestock does not appear to be a significant factor  in the areas occupied by mountain mahogany in Idaho.  LITERATURE CITED  Furniss, M. M . and W. F. Barr. 1967.

W. WANG·  Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis) was widely used  In interspecies hybridization . Hybrids from natural or  controlled pollinat ion were made with L. decidua, L.  gmelini, L. g. var japonica, va r. algensis, va r. principis­rupprechtii,  L . occidenlalis, and L. sibirica (Dimpflmier,  1959, Fairbairn, 1959, Schoenike, 1961 ). All interspecies  crosses made within the section Pauciseriales were suc­cessful  , but the inter-section cross between L. decidua  (Section Pauciseriales) and L. occidentalis (Section  Mulliseriales) produced only one triploid hybrid (Lar­sen  and Westergaard , 1938).  The most well-known and extensively pla nted larch  hybrid is the Dunkeld la rch, a sponta neously produced  L. leptolepis x L. decidua hybrid from Dunkeld, Scot­land  . It proved to be more vigorous than the progenitors  In I:.urope and in North America (Cook 1942, Edwards  1956, Ostenfeld and Larsen , 1930). The a rtificial FI  hybrid of this cross was mass produced and planted in a  commercial sca le.  A hybrid between the western larch of North Ameri­ca  (L. occidentalis) and J apanese larch reported here  was obviously more vigorous at the early seed lin g stage,  and was significantly higher in height growth than the  open-pollinated progenies of western-larch seed parents  at the end of the first a nd second growing seasons (Fig.  1). This interspecific hybridization was made in four  years since 1966 in cooperation with T akanobu Furu­koshi  of the Forest Genetics Research Institute, Meguro,  Japan, and the late Dr. S. S. Pauley of the University  of Minnesota in a larch hybridization experiment be·  tween L. leplolepis, L. lan'cina, and L. occidenlalis.  Reciprocal crosses were made with pollen of the mother  parents by the cooperators. In both cases, the seed set  a nd viability of the L. occidentalis x L. leptolepis hybrid  ~eed were low .

Two~year old seedlings of Larix occidentalis  x L. leptolepis hybrid (right) and L. occiden­talis  (x 1/ 8).  linations suggested possible incipient incompatibility  in this inter-section hybridization.  POLLEN SOURCES  The L. leptolepis pollen used in the hybrids included  in this report were collected from two trees from each of  the following two natural stands, (I) Tenzintoge (Fuji  Mt. 1400 m), and (2) Mizugoya (Fuji Mt. 1650 m). They  are located on the northern slopes of the Fuji Mountain,  and close to the lower natural altitudinal distribution  for this species (Fig. 2). The low-altitude pollen sources  were used for their early Oowering. L. occiden talis in  the vicinity of Moscow Mountain in northern Idaho was  receptive for pollination at about mid-April , and L.  leptolepis pollen trees in Japan bloomed in the early  part of April. Female Oowers were isolated about 10  days before pollination. Fresh forced pollen were used  in the pollination with a syringe-type duster.  The western larch used as the female parents were  random trees in natural stands of the Moscow Mountain  area. They were trees of regular form with fully de­veloped  crowns located near forest clearings. They pro­duced  male and female Oowers in abundance almost  every year.  HYBRID SEEDLINGS  In the early seedling stage, the hybrid had longer  cotyledons, and longer primary needles than the western  larch and Japanese larch. The average primary needle  length of the hybrid was 4.1 cm and those of L. occi­dentalis  and L. leptolepis were 2.7 cm and 3.3 cm re­spectively.  The needle stomata characters of the hybrid  were intermediate between the two parents. The average  number of stomata rows on the dorsal surface was 7.2  rows in the western larch , 12.5 in the Japanese larch,  and 10.7 in the hybrid. On the ventral surface, the west­ern  larch had 1 to 4 rows of stomata, the hybrids and the  Japanese larch had no stomata. In subesquent crops  of hybrid the ventral surface predominately wa.s free' of  stomata with the exception of a few needle samples  which bore 1 to 2 rows of stomata on the ventral sur­face.  \ ,  The hybrid also differed from the western larch in  bud color and shape of needle tips. The hybrid broke  dormancy earlier, had larger number of cotyledons,  more cells in the endodermis, and less cells in the  epithelial layer than L. occiden talis.  HEIGHT GROWTH  In the twelve hybrids raised from the first crop of con­trolled  pollination, the most striking difference between  the hybrids and the open-pollinated western larch was in  height growth (Fig. 1). The hybrid seedlings and those  from open-pollinated seeds of the mother trees were  raised in 2 x 2-inch tubes arranged in randomized com­plete  blocks with two replicates in a greenhouse under  24-hour day-length in the first year and under natural  day-length in the second year. The 4-month, I-year  and 2-year height growth were tabulated (Table I).  The differences in height growth between the hy­brids  and the open pollinated progenies of the four seed  trees which produced hybrids were significant at t % level  for both the 4-month, I-year and 2-year height growth.  The height growth of the open pollinated western larch  progenies of No.2, No.3, No.4 and No.5 trees were  not significantly different. The hybrid samples were  not large enough to determine conclusively the effect  of different pollen sources. However. t -year and 2-year  growth periods showed that the Mizugoya (Fuji 1650  m) hybrids were consistently higher than the Tenzintoge  (Fuji 1400 m) hybrids (Fig. 3). This difference suggested  the importance of genetic variation of pollen sources in  connection with the hybrid performance.  GENETIC VARIATION OF L. leptolepis.  L. leptolep is has a small natural range of distribu­tion.  Natural forests appear in scattered stands in cen­tral  Honshu between 900 m and 2800 m in elevations  (Fig. 2). Distinct genetic variation in growth and mor­phological  characters were reported within this species.  Hayashi (1951) observed that the best growth in the  /  Figure 2.

The best  height growth in eastern Iowa was from seed sources  above 1850 m (Kepler 1962). In Minnesota (Pauley et  a l 1965) and in Wisconsin (Lester 1964) the best height  growth was not associated with the altitude or latitude  of the seed origin , but the best two seed sources were  the same in both tests.  In experimenta l plantations of several species of  la rch in New York State L. leptalep is and its hybrid  L. lep tolepis x L. decidua consistent ly were superior in  growth rate (Liltlefield and Eliason 1956) and volume  production (Eliason and Carlson 1963) to all other  la rch. L. leptolepis was superior to L. decidua in Min­nesota  (Pauley et al 1965). But in Idaho open pollinated  seedlings of Fuj i seed sources and its hybrid from the  reciproca l cross (L. leptalep is x L. accidentalis) susta ined  light frost damage at the tender branch tips in early  September. No frost damage was observed in the open  pollinated progenies of the western larch mother trees  included in the hybridization, nor in any seedlings in a  t 4-seed origin provenance test of western larch from  Canada , Idaho, Montana , Oregon, and Washington.  Differences in frost hardiness of J apanese larch  were reported in earlier provenance studies. Lindquist  (1956) observed in a 14-seed origin experiment that there  are severa l poss ible cl imatic races within the J apanese  larch each adapted to va rious climatic conditions. The  result of the 25-seed origin IUFRO international J ap­a  nese larch provena nce test made in western Europe and  North America had shown signifi ca nt genetic differences  in frost ha rdiness and cold resistence (Langner t 958,  Haltemer 1970). The potential va lue of L. leptalepis  will be its immunity to larch canker (Dasyscypha Wil­kommii),  its domonstrated superiority in growth rate,  and its use as the parents of heterotic hybrids. The  genetic variations in L. leptolep is as shown in prov­enance  studies indicated that further improvement in  growth and frost resistance of the hybrids maybe ob­tained  through selection of breeding materials.

PitkinZ  It is becoming increasingly apparent that in the  future, timber production will be concentrated on n  smaller land base than heretofore. Of necessity, for­esters  will be forced to max imize yield on these lands  devoted to intensive management. One possible way  to increase production is through adoption of fertiliza­tion  programs. ''''ith the exception of nursery manage­ment,  this technique has not been employed exten­sively  in forestry. Becent research in various parts of  the world, however, has revealed that important  growth increases may come about through the addi­tion  of particular nutrients to the soil. A great deal of  pertinent information concerning the subject may be  found in the volume entitled Forest Fertilization:  Th eory and Practice, published by the T.Y.A. in 1968.  Although it is now well documented that trees  can respond to fertilization treatment, the forest man­ager  cannot tacitly assume they will respond in his  particular situation. Extensive forest fertil ization pro­grams  demand an impressive initial expense, and  cannot be entered into blindly. Because of thi s, ex­perimental  programs designed to test the fertilizer  responsiveness of particular species growing in par­ti  cular environments are underway in various parts  of the United States (e.g., Regional Forest Jutrition  Project, western Washington and Oregon; Coopera­tive  Hesearch in Forest Fertilization, Florida ). Such a  program has now been established for Northern Ida­ho,  and is described below.  1 This project was partinlly supported with funds from the  McIntire·Stennis Cooperntivc Forestry Hesenrch Progrnm of  the V.S.D.A.  2Professors of Forestry  The current University of Idaho Forest Ferti liza­tion  project developed after earli er research produced  encouraging res ults. At Ramskull Creek ( near Emida,  Benewah County), for example, an application of 150  Ibs/acre nitrogen almost tripl ed the growth rate of  15-year-old grand fir (Abies grandis [Dougl.] Lindl. )  growing under the canopy of an offsite ponderosa  pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) plantation (Loewen­stein  and Pitkin, 1963). In a second experiment, con­du  cted on the Flat Creek Unit of the University of  Idaho Experimental Forest, an application of 300  Ibs/ acre nitrogen, 150 lbs/acre phosphorus, and 150  Ibs/acre potassium more than doubled the diameter  growth of 25-year-old grand fir during the 3-year  period following fertilization (Loewenstein and Pit­kin,  1971 ) . Response of Douglas fir (Pseudo/sugo  menziesii [Mirh.] Franco.), while not as dramatic,  was still appreciable. The great ga in in fib er produc­tion  overshadowed the small decrease in specific  g ra vi ty resulting from treatment in these experiments.  Although the study at Flat Creek employed phos­phorous  and potassium as well as nitrogen, results of  the Rumskull Creek expcrim(:;nt as weB as other un­published  work clea rl y show the domi nant influence  of nitrogen. This element was selected for the exten­sive  invest igation de tailed in this paper.  Study Description  Hesponse of grand fir and Douglas fir is being  investigated in this work because 1) earlier experi­ments  showed they had the abili ty to respond to addi­tional  nitrogen, and 2) interested foresters in the area  desired more definitive information concerning these  two species. l)resent financial considerations preclude  experiments with other native species but in the  future it is hoped that their response will be assessed  also.  For purposes of this study, that portion of Idaho  north of the Salmon Hiver has been subdivided into  3 major units, based on the character of the under­lying  rock. These subdivisions include (1) Tertiary  granitic rocks and granitic rocks of the Idaho Batho­lith,  (2) Columbia Hiver basalt, (3) Belt series of  metamorphosed sediments. Within the 3 units, plots  are being established in stands of Douglas fir and/or  grand fir. Stands representing 2 general age classes,  15 to 35 years, and 35 to 60 years are involved. Site  selection has comprised one of the most critical phases  of the entire project. Unless the stands selected truly  represent widespread conditions, the prediction value  of experimental results will be reduced.  Personnel from both private corporations antI  public agencies have been asked to suggest possible  plot locations. Information concerning suggested sites  is recorded by these cooperators on standard form s.  Final selection is made by the project leaders after  personal inspection of sites deemed likly to be satis­factory.  A general description of salient features of the site  and associated vegetation is made at the time of plot  establishment. A complete soil profile description will  be made at each site. In addition, surface soil samples  will be collected and analyzed for pH, nutrients,  organic matter, texture, moisture relations, etc., to  more completely characterize the soil.  Twelve installations are being made on each rock  type, 3 for each of the 4 species-age class combina­tions.  An installation consists of 8 plots. Two of these  plots serve as controls, 2 others are fertilized with  urea at a rate of 200 Ibs/acre nitrogen, no other treat­ment  being given. The remaining 4 plots are heing  used to assess the influence of thinning on fertilizer  response. These plots are thinned to about a 15-foot  spacing. Two thinned plots receive no further treat­ment,  the other 2 are fertilized Similarly to the un­thinned  plots. The rate of 200 Ihs/acre nitrogen was  chosen after assessment of results from the prelimi­nary  work mentioned earlier. Fertilizer is spread as  evenly as possihle by means of cyclone spreaders. Size  of individual plots is 1/10 acre, and each plot is  surrounded by a buffer strip which is treated in the  same manner as the plot itself. Measurements will  only be made on trees within the plot houndary.  Before fertilization, all stems over 2 inches DBH  (diameter at breast height ) are tagged and initial  measurements are recorded. Height measurements are  made for 5 dominant or co-dominant trees per plot.  From these, the site index is found. The figures also  serve as the initial readings for determination of  height response.  The first series of plot remeasurements is to be  made at the conclusion of the second growing season  after treatment. DBH of all trees previously recorded  will be remeasured. The major series of plot remea ­Sl1rements  will he made after 4 growing seasons have  elapsed. By this time, any height differences res ulting  from treatment should be large enough for accurate  determination. As indicated above, because of the  time-consuming nature of height determinations, these  measurements will be restricted to 5 trees per plot.  DBH will again be found for all trees previously  measured. At the time of these remeasurements, incre-ment  borings will be obtained from the trees utilized  for height determinations. These will be used to  obtain a record of annual diameter growth for the  4-year period immediately prior to treatment as well  as annual growth during the subsequent period. These  data are needed to determine if possible differences  in tree growth are actually due to treatment, or  whether some environmental difference between  plots is responsible for the dissimilarity.  The possible influence of treatment on wood  quality will also be subject to scrutiny in this study.  From the increment borings, data will be secured  concerning percent early wood, percent late wood,  and specific gravity.  Nitrogen levels in the foliage tissue of representa­tive  trees from each plot will be determined at the  conc1usion of each growing season as standard prac­tice.  Additionally, changes in nitrogen levels of foliage  during the growing season will be assessed on selected  sites. More nutritional aspects will be considered if  financing permits.  All data are being collected in a manner which  promotes rapid computer analysis of stati stical signifi­cance.  The use of the computer is mandatory, as  some 30,000 individual trees are subject to at least  certain measurements. As results accumulate, coop­erators  and others interested in the work will be kept  informed of results through periodic progress reports,  as well as formal publications.  Proposed Supplementary Studies  While the main thrust of this work is concerned  with growth response of Douglas fir and grand fir,  treatment may also produce other effects of conse­quence.  For example, the nutritional status of the  trees as it affects susceptibility to attack by insects  and pathogenic microorganisms might be a fruitful  subject for investigation on these plots. Secondly.  fertilization could have a profund influence on subor­dinate  vegetation, augmenting the forage supply of  big game and domestic livestock and improving the  habitat for wildlife. These plots would lend them­selves  very weB to a study of this aspect.  Cooperators  This forest fertilization investigation is truly a co·  opera tive project. With the limited direct fin ancing  available, contributions of one sort or another from  ou tside sources were essential, and have been forth­coming  to a gmtifying degree. Installations have  been established on lands of Inland Empire Paper  Company, Milwaukee Land Company, Pack Hiver  Company, Potlatch Forests, Inc., Heggear and Sons,  Orofino, Idaho, the State of Idaho Department of  Public Lands, and the United States Forest Service. In  most instan ces, these 1andowners have found it possi.  ble to perform the required thinning operations at  their own expense, which has been an invaluable aid  to the project. All the necessary urea fertilizer has  been donated by Cominco American, Inc., and Shell  Chemical Co. In addition, Phillips Petroleum Co. has  made a monetary contribution. The Soil Conservation  Service will aid in classifying the soils of the various  installations.  .,' ,. -TO· CIRCULATE SEE  .

Wildlife and Range Sciences  No. 19 December, 1972  Forestry I Wildlife I and Range Experiment Station  Natural Regeneration Following Four Treatments Of  Slash On Clearcut Areas Of Lodgepole Pine - A Case History  By David L. Adams I  Logging slash from clear-cut lodgepole pine (Pinus  conlorlo Dougl.) stands has been dealt with in several  different ways. An excellent opportunity to co~pare  natural tree establishment following various slash treat­ments  was provided when the U. S. Forest Service ap­plied  4 different treatments on lodgepole pine c1ear­cuts  in north-central Colorado. Three different treat­ments  were made on contiguous blocks of the same sa le.  Two additional sale blocks described here wefe on sim­ilar  sites in close proximity to, but not contiguous with,  the others. Although the treatments were not replicated,  the kind of tree establishment experienced on these  sale areas should be indicative of what might happen un­der  simi lar conditions.  The study areas are on south aspects at about 9,000  feet elevation with slopes varying from 5 to 15 percent.  The gray-wooded soils are from 2 to 2 1h feet in depth  and are derived from granite parent material. Texture  varies from sandy loam in the upper horizons to gravely  loamy sand in the lower horizons, and pH ranges be­tween  5 and 6.  The treatments were: (1) ""broadcast burn"", in which  the slash was left where it fell during the logging opera­tion  and later burned , (2) ""walk -down with dozer"",  in which a crawler tractor was run back-and-forth over  the area after logging to press all residual trees and  logging slash to the ground , (3) "" dozer pile-a nd-burn"",  in which the residual trees and logging slash were  pushed into windrows and later burned, and (4) "" lop  and scatter"", in which the tops were trimmed and the  slash scattered by hand during logging.  1 Associate Professor of Forestry, University of Idaho. The  study was conducted while: Dr. Adams was an Instructor  in the College of Forestry and Natural Resources, Colo­rado  State: University.  The results of sampling the reproduction by the stocked  mil-acre quadrat method2 and of measuring the slash  depth at each sample point are shown in Table 1.  It is ass}lmed by the ""stocked-quadrat"" method of sam­pling  reproduction that the area is divided into squares  or ""quadrats"", each of which could conceivably support  a tree to maturity. One hundred percent stocking would  mean that each quadrat on the area is occupied by at  least one seedling. Each quadrat not occupied by re­production  would theoretically represent a portion of  the site which is not being fully utilized by gree growth.  R. W. Cowlin used the following definitions of stock­ing  when using the stocked-quadrat method for sampling  Douglas-fir reproduction:  Good stocking  Medium stocking  Poor stocki ng  Non-stocked  70 to 100% of quadrats stocked  40 to 69% of quadrats stocked  10 to 39% of quadrats stocked  o to 9% of quadrats stocked  These stocking level definitions were used as guides in  this study.  From the standpoint of this classification, none of the  treatments studied resulted in ""good stocking""; however,  all of the areas studied except those piled and burned fell ·  into the ""medium stocked"" category. One pile and burn  area was classified as ""poorly stocked"" and the other as  «non-stocked I I.  As can be noted in Table t, there seems to be a direct  relationship between the presence of slash and the pres­ence  of seed lings. In serotinous cone areas serious de­ficiencies  both in terms of seedl ing numbers and dis-  2Cowlin, R. W., 1932. Sampling Douglas Fir  Stands by the Stocked-Quadrat Method.  30:437.  Reproduction  Journ. For.  tribution can resu lt from slash disposal operations which  eliminate too much of the seed. On these south slopes  slash also appeared to playa ro ll in providing shelter .  This was particularly evident on the pile and burn areas  where nearly all of the reproduction became established  on the north and east sides of stumps or unburned slash.  Although the lop and scatter} broadcast burn, and walk­down  areas might be considered to be adequately stocked  taking into account on ly numbers of seedlings per acre,  the di stibution as indicated by the percent of mil-acre  stocking showed that some spots were decidely under­stocked.  A count of seedlings on stocked quadrats also  indicated poor distribution . For example. on the walk­down  area where only 45 percent of the mil-acre quad­rats  were stocked, the average number of seedlings per  stocked quadrat was 5.7.  It appears from thi s small sample that natura l lodgepole  pine reproduction can best be obtained by leaving the  logging slash uniformly di stributed over the clearcut  area.

However, nearly all of the reproduction sampled on the ""lop and scat­ter""  area appears to have established immediately following treatment.

Br ick e r '  The objective of th is report is to furnish information that  wi ll lead to more complete ut iliza tion of bark in Idaho. It  shows where the bark is being produced , by volume of each  species. With this information at hand , the potential  users of bark shou ld be in a better position to select lo­ca  tions for their bark uti lizaLion facilit ies.  Some wood processi ng pla nts in Idaho are closing down  because they cannot meet the waste di sposa l standards of  Idaho's air and water quality laws. Landfills offer only a  short-term solution to this problem. The cost of approved  bark-burning equipment is often prohibitive to sma ll  compa nies.  A second consideration a lso relates to the econom)' of Idaho  whose forest industries rank second in importance only to  agriculture. Idaho's communities just cannot afford to  destroy bark beca use today it is becoming a valuable raw  mater ia l. i\1any marketable products can be made from  bark (3) and neighboring states a re producing these  products to their economic advantage (4).  At present only a small pa rt of Idaho's ba rk is used as a  source of energy. Here is an excellent opponunity for  beuer utiliza tion of this na tura l resource to help relieve the  current energy cri sis.

Bark volumes are expressed in cuni ts  (1 cunit equals 100 cubic feet ).  T able 1 shows the cunits of bark of each species that are  produced in each county. This informa tion is impon ant  because the properties of bark va ry depend ing on tree  species. Some types of bark are especia lly suited to cenain  products.

Most of the avail­able  volume tables do not include these lower  diameter classes. Small-tree volume tables for  Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, grand  fir, and a composite table for alI species are pre­sented.  The trees used to construct the tables were  growing on medium sites near Athol, Idaho. Each  tree was felIed and the following information re­corded:  species, diameter inside and outside bark  at the stump, diameter outside bark at breast  height, diameter outside bark at every even 8-foot  section and total height. On a subsample, diameter  inside bark and outside bark were measured to  the nearest tenth inch. This information and linear  regression analysis was used to develop an equa­tion  to predict diameter inside bark at breast  height and at even 8-foot sections for every tree.  Inside bark cubic foot volumes were computed  using Smalian's formula (V = b t tL where V  is cubic foot volume, b is basal area in square feet  of the large end, t is the basal area in square feet  of the small end and L is the length in feet).  Board foot volumes were calculated by diagram­ming  each I-inch diameter class bolt into the  maximum number of 2 x 2's, 2 x 3's or 2 x 4's  that could be recovered. Green lumber dimensions  were determined from standards set by the West..  ern Wood Products Association:'  Volume table construction was accomplished by  regressing volume against diameter squared times  height. An examination of the residual plots in­dicated  unequal residual variances for the range  of predicted volumes. Consequently, weighted  least squares regression was used. For the cubic  foot tables, the model V = a + bD'H with weights  of 1/ (D'H) ' was used where a and b are coeffici­ents,  D is diameter breast height, and H is total  height. The board foot tables were constructed  using the model V = bD'H and weights of I /D'H  where b, D, and H are as previously defined.  Volumes presented are for total height above a  1 foot stump.  Users are cautioned that the tables are based  upon relatively few trees from one geographic  area in northern Idaho. These tables wiII be up­dated  as additional information is available.

L. McGrath and H. Loewenstein2  INTRODUCTION  Few soil-site studies of forest land in Idaho  exist despite a wealth of information for other  areas of the U.S. and other countries. However,  the forest industry is of great economic impor­tance  to the state and especially so in northern  Idaho. With the ever increasing demand for  lumber and paper products, it is essential that  forest lands produce to the optimum. To get this  optimum production, effective management  must be practiced.  Investments in forest management are usual­ly  costly and must be based on fairly accurate  estimates of expected future yields. Current  methods of estimating forest site quality are  based on site index. This requires well stocked  stands of desired species. Many areas in north­ern  Idaho have been cut-over or burned, or else  are poorly stocked, stocked with undesirable  species, or unstocked. In situations such as  these, an indirect method of evaluation is needed  so that the best land use can be obtained.  Through the correlation of soil and topographic  characteristics and site index, site quality may  be estimated by measuring these characteris­tics.  This study was designed to find the relation-  1 Published with the approval of Director, Forest, Wildlife and  Range Experiment Station as Contribution No.8, Univer­sity  of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho 83843.  ships between certain soil and topographic  characteristics and site quality for Douglas-fir  (Pseudotsuga menziesii Franco), grand fjr( Abies  grandis (Doug\.) Lind\.) and western larch(Larix  occidentalis Nutt.) within the University of  Idaho Experimental Forest.  PREVIOUS WORK  Although soil-site studies have been per­formed  throughout the United States and  Canada, very little work has been completed in  the intermountain area of eastern Washington,  northern Idaho, and western Montana.  Cox, McConnell, and Matthew (1960) found  that depth of soil in which tree roots might de­velop  is the principal factor influencing growth  of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) in  western Montana. Holtby (1947) discovered that  soil texture 6 in. (15.24 cm) below the soil surface  is a fairly reliable indicator of site quality in the  ponderosa pine zone of eastern Washington.  For western white pine (Pinus monticola  Doug\.) in the northern Rockies, Copeland (1956  and 1958) found that site index could be corre­lated  with effective soil depth, depth to zone of  reduced permeability, and the available water  holding capacity of the top 3 ft. (.91 m) of soi\.  This project was financed by a grant from the University of  Idaho Experimental Forest.  1{ 1./.1 2Former graduate student and Professor of Forestry respec­tively.

Base and Fosberg (1971), in establishing pre­diction  equations for site quality in northern  Idaho for four conifers, found the following  characteristics to be significant. In the predic­tion  equation for ponderosa pine, soil family ac­counted  for 45 percent of the variation in site  index. Elevation and moist consistence of the  most developed horizon in the upper 40 in. (101.6  cm) accounted for 41 percent of the variation in  site index of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta  Doug!.) in the prediction equation with elevation  approximately 25 percent more important than  moist consistence. In the equation selected to  predict site index of western white pine, soil  drainage and moist color of the upper 6 in. (15.2  cm) mineral horizon accounted for 64 percent of  the variation in site index with soil drainage 33  percent more important than soil color. Eleva­tion,  soil subgroup, and soil family accounted for  26 percent of the variation in site index of west­ern  larch in the prediction, with soil family 25  percent more important than elevation and 75  percent more important than soil subgroup.  Wall and Loewenstein (1969) found that for es­timating  site quality of grand fir on volcanic ash  soils in northern Idaho, the characteristics with  significant effect are percent slope, elevation,  aspect, and depth of ash deposit (effective soil  depth, texture, and soil color).  The work that has been reviewed brings to  light the many factors that have been used to try  to determine site quality in the intermountain  area. Given adequate precipitation and habitat  for tree growth, the following characteristics  could probably best be used to give some indica­tion  of site quality:  (1) elevation  (2) slope  (3) aspect  (4) soil depth  (5) effective soil depth  (6) water holding capacity  (7) texture  However, to produce a relatively precise esti­mate  of production potential, a more intensive  study of the soils in a particular area is required.  AREA DESCRIPTION  Location, Size, Access  due to differential erosion and deposition (drift­ing  affect).  Approximately 6,600 years ago the volcanic  eruption of Mt. Mazama (Crater Lake, Ore.) re­sulted  in an ash fall over the entire region  (Fryxell, 1965). Most of the ash has been eroded  away in the study area except on sites which are  presently in western redcedar/pachistima  (Thujaplicata DonnJPachistimamyrsinites Raf.)  habitat type and grand fir/pachistima (Abies  grandis (Doug!.) Lindl.lPachistima myrsinites  Raf.) habitat type. Apparently the kind and  amount of vegetation in these areas during the  a ltithermal period was sufficient to prevent ex­tensive  erosion of the volcanic ash. Where the  ash deposits are present they range in depth  from 10 to 20 in. (25.4 to 50.8 cm).  The majority of the soil development within  the study area has taken place in the loess and  volcanic ash strata.  Vegetation  The Flat Creek Unit is predominantly conifer­ous  forest with a few small open meadows. There  are four habitat types (Daubenmire and  Daubenmire, (1968) represented. The majority of  the area is grand fir/pachistima (Abies grandis  (Doug!.) Lindl.!Pachistima myrsinites Raf.). The  next most common habitat type is western  redcedar/pachistima (Thuja plicata Donn/  Pachistima myrsinites Raf.). Douglas-fir/  ninebark (Pseudotsuga menziesii Franco/  Physocarpus malvaceous Cam b.) habitat type is  found on the drier, warmer slopes and ridgetops.  The most restricted habitat type is the subalpine  fir/pachistima (Abies laziocarpa (Hook.)  Nutt.lPachistima myrsinites Raf.) which occurs  only in stream bottoms which are ""frost pock­ets.""  The distribution of vegetative communities  within this area seems to be goverened more by  air drainage patterns and aspect than by eleva­tion.  Much of the vegetation within the Flat Creek  Unit has been disturbed by either logging, fire,  insect damage, or grazing and is in varying  stages of succession.  Climate  The study area is designated as the Flat Creek  Unit of the University of Idaho Experimental  Forest. It is located 4 miles south along state  highway 9 from the junction of state highway 9  and U.S. highway 95A in Latah County, Ida. It  includes all of section 33 and portions of sections The climate within the study area is relatively  28,31, and 32 T41N, R3W and portions of sections mild.

TO CIRCULATE SEE  L'DRARIlIN THIS FLOOR  METHODS  Field Work  In connection with a forest inventory project,  80 plots had been randomly selected within the  study area for the purpose of collecting growth  information (Allen, unpub.) From the data gen­erated  by this inventory project, height and. age  of the dominant trees on each plot were obtamed  and site index was determined using standard  curves for this area (Cummings, 1937; Stage,  1959). The plots were then stratified and 21 were  selected, based on the widest range of site index  within the area.  For each plot the following information was  recorded: (1) habitat type, based on Dau­benmire's  classification system (Daubenmire  and Daubenmire, 1968); (2) elevation, to the  nearest 50 ft. (15.2 m) using an altimeter; (3) soil  parent material and geololn'; (4) I~nd form; (5)  slope position; (6) macrorelIef; (7) mICrorelIef; (8)  slope, in percent measured with an abney level;  (9) aspect, recorded in eight quadrants.  Within each plot one soil pit was dug to below  the effective rooting zone to expose the soil hori­zons.  The profile description of each pit,based on  the Soil Survey Manual procedures (SOIl Survey  Staff 1951), consisted of: (1) horizon designation  and depth; (2) boundary characteristics; (3) dry  and moist color according to Munsell notation;  (4) texture; (5) structure; (6) dry, moist, and wet  consistence; (7) clay films; (8) pores; and (9) roots.  Each horizon in the profile was sampled for bulk  density using a core sampler. A 500 gm sample  was collected from each mineral horizon, air  dried, and sieved so that the 2 mm and less size  fraction could be used in the laboratory.  Laboratory and Computer Analysis  The laboratory work consisted of physical and  chemical analysis of the soil following standard  procedures.  Computer analysis of the data was done by  stepwise multiple regression using a Statistical  Analysis System (Barr and Goodnight, 1972)  program.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Grand fir site indices ranged from 30 to 60,  Douglas-fir from 50 to 80, and western larch from  30 to 80.  A bisequm was found within the loess in most  of the pits which expresses the fact that there  has been more than one major deposition. The  paleosols found in the lower sequm usually had a  large increase in clay and high bulk densities.  These bulk densities varied from 1.68 to 2.02 with  the majority falling between 1.84 and 1.97. Since  root penetration becomes seriously restricted at  bulk densities this high, these levels were used  as the criteria for determining effective rooting  depth. The very few roots that did penetrate fol­lowed  cracks and were flattened against the ped  faces giving indication that this was a fragipan.  The first step in analyzing the data involved  running the stepwise regressions on the hori­zons  of each profile supporting a particular tree  species. The variables in each linear model with  the highest sums of squares and coefficients sig­nificantly  different from zero were selected and  used in future prediction equations for each  speCles.  Douglas-fir  In the prediction of site index for Douglas-fir,  effective rooting depth was the single most im­portant  factor accounting for 39.10 percent of the  total variation in site index. The best regression  equation for predicting site index for Douglas-fir  follows:  Site index = 89.4507 + 0.4730 (eff. rooting  depth in inches)  R2 = 0.8339  0.0994 (ppm of avail. Pin surface  horiz.)  - 0.4643 (% avail. H20 in surface  horiz.) - 72.3721 (meq.llOOgms  of exch. N a in third horiz.)  + 0.0360 (C:N of third horiz.) -  4.8469 (tex. of third horiz.)  Standard error of estimate = 4.850  A slightly less efficient equation for predicting  site index of Douglas-fir states:  Site index = 6.6033 + 1.9463 (elev. in feet) +  0.1774 (eff. rooting depth in in­ches)  + 0.6026 (wet consis. of sec­ond  horiz.}-4.1907 (tex. of third  horiz.)  R2 = 0.7542  Standard error of estimate = 5.375  Although this equation accounts for slightly less  of the total variation in site index than does the  other equation (75.42 percent compared to 83.39  percent), the variables in this equation can be  observed in the field. If the less precise predic­tion  is adequate, expenses would be much lower,  as no laboratory analysis would be required (if  finger determination of texture and wet consis­tence  is acceptable).  Western larch  There are only seven observations for western  larch in this study. Therefore, models were li­mited  to not more than three independent vari­ables.  The best three-variable equation is ex­pressed  as follows:  Site index = 252.4245 + 40.6077 (02 depth in  inches) - 44.1904 (pH of fourth  horiz .) + 0.2557 (ppm of P in  fourth horiz.)  R2 = 0.9907  Standard error of estimate = 2.479  The best two-variable model for western larch is  listed below:  Site index = 291.3960 + 39.8304 (02 depth in  inches) - 50.3588 (pH of fourth  horiz.)  R2 + 0.8878  Standard error of estimate = 7.462  The two-variable prediction model would prove  useful as the depth of the 02 horizon and the pH  of the fourth horizon in the profile would be easy  and inexpensive to measure.  Grand fir  Any of the equations predicting site quality for  &lt; J  this species with adequate accuracy contained  variables that required laboratory analysis.  Therefore the best prediction equation for grand  fir is the only one presented:  Site index 75834.5657 + 12.9801 (% O.M. of  surface horiz.)  329.8935 (% N of surface horiz.) +  0.0767 (dry color of s urface  horiz.) + 7.2530 (meq/100 gms Mg  in second horiz.)  R' = .9849  Standard error of estimate = 1.706  This equation provides an excellent estimate of  site index for grand fir as the standard error of  estimate is quite low.  These prediction equations provide a land  manager with a method of estimating the quality  of sites that are poorly stocked, stocked with un­desirable  species, or unstocked. Even though  t his study was restricted to t he University of  Idaho Experimental Forest, these r esults are  applicable to areas with similar parent materi­als,  climate, and topography.

L. Kulhavy and J. A. Schenk'  ABSTRACT  During 1971 . a year of high grand fir (Abies grandis  (Doug I.) Lindl.) cone production insect damage and  cone production were evaluated on Potlatch Corpora­tion  land. Latah County. Idaho. The area was primarily  an Abies grandis( Pachistima myrsinites habitat type. An  examination of cones collected from three stands in the  Gold Creek drainage revealed that 6.4 percent of the  seed was destroyed by insects while 52.4 percent of the  seed crop had undeveloped endosperm. The two major  insect pests were Dioryctria abietella (Denis and  Schiffermueller). a coneworm. and Hylemya abietis  Huckett. a cone maggot. These insects destroyed 5.7  percent of the seed crop. Three binocular methods were  tested to estimate the cone production from the ground.  The best prediction equation was:  Y = -10.8 + 1.9 WHO + 1.5 SS (r' = 0.806).  where. WHO is the number of cones visible on the top  two whorls and SS is the number of cones visible on the  south side of the crown.  j Contribu tion No. 23, Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Sta­tion.

Abies grandis (Douglas) Lindley. is  becoming increasingly important as a timber resource in  northern Idaho with lumber and other products  produced from grand fir accounting for 18 percent of  Idaho's merchantable forest products (Wilson 1964). As  stands are logged and intensity of forest management in­creases,  artificial and natural regeneration becomes in­creasingly  important in the silviculture of this tree  species. Private industry and state and public lands no  longer depend entirely on natural regeneration; long­range  management policies call for the establishment of  seed production areas and seed orchards to meet  regeneration needs. However, cone and seed insects that  are minor pests in unmanaged forests may become im­portant  economic pests in seed production areas.  Coupled with the destruction of seeds by insects are the  natural low viabi lity and germination of grand fir seeds  (USDA 1965) and the cyclic nature of grand fir cone  crops. Years 01 good cone production are usually  followed by years of poor cone production or crop  failures (Eis et al. 1965. Franklin et al. 1974).  The objectives of this study were to evaluate the  damage of cone and seed insects to the seed crop near  Potl atch. Idaho on Potlatch Corporation lands during a  year of high cone production (1971). and to develop a  method to predict cone production.

Pfister and  Woolwine (1963) listed the insects and their damage to  the grand fir cone crop at Deception Creek Experimen­tal  Forest in northern Idaho. In British Columbia,  Hedlin (1966, 1967, 1974) and Ruth and Hedlin (1974)  evaluated the damage by insects to grand fir cones, in­cluding  a key to the damage. Kulhavy and Schenk (in  press) evaluated the damage to the 1970 and 1971 seed  crops in Idaho during years of moderate (1970) and high  (1971) cone production. Kulhavy (1974) prepared a key  to the pestiferous insects of grand fir in Idaho. Moyer  and Parker (1973) and Kulhavy et al. (1975) prepared  checklists of the cone and seed insects of grand fir in  Idaho.  Partial cone-count estimations have been used to es­timate  cones within trees. These methods consist of es­timating  cones on a single whorl, a single branch, or  other methods of partial cone counts, and comparing  these to tota l cone counts (Eis 1973, Schenk et al. 1972,  and Winjum and Johnson 1962). Franklin, (1968) used a  conversion factor of 1.7 times the number of cones visi­ble  with binoculars from the ground to estimate the  cone crop of grand fir.  METHODS  Cone Collections and Dissections  During June through September of 1971, 15 1/10-  acre plots were used to evaluate insect-caused seed losses  and cone-count techniques on Potlatch Corporation  lands 6 miles northeast of Potlatch, Latah County,  Idaho. The study was established in a primarily Abies  grandis/ Pachistima myrsinites habitat type (Daubenmire  and Daubenmire 1968). In conjunction with another  study, ' five I/IO-acre plots, deployed on a 10-chain grid  pattern, were used in each of the three stands designated  Gold Creed (GC) stand I, 2, 3. Location of each stand,  average elevation, slope. aspect, site index, basal area  and stand volume data are summarized in Table I.  Stand data, including cone-bearing grand fir and cone  production are summarized in Table 2. Stands GC I and  2 were logged for high value Douglas-fir ( Pselldotsllga  menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and ponderosa pine ( Pinus  ponderosa Laws.) about 30 and 75 years ago. The resul­tant  overstory stands consist of two age classes of  released grand fir. The lower slopes of GC 3 were logged  about 25 years ago for Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine,  resulting in a present stand of predominantly mature  grand fir. Cone production in the Gold Creek stands  was mainly on the grand fir released from earlier log­ging.

Wildlire. and Range Experiment Station. University or Idaho.  Moscow, Idaho.  On each I/ IO-acre plot, two cone-bearing grand fir  were climbed and four mature cones were picked from  each of the north and south sides of the crown. Four  cones from each tree were placed in single-light-source  rearing cartons in the laboratory at 24°C to capture and  identify emerging adu lts. The remaining cones from  each sample tree were dissected for insect damage. Ex­ternal  injury on each of the dissected cones was recorded  and later correlated to internal infestations. The cones  were cut in half lengthwise using a modified Winjum­Johnson  cone cutter (1960). The seeds on the axial sur­face  were counted and the number of seeds and location  and type of damage was recorded by causal insect  species. Seeds were then dissected from the cone scales,  and complete counts were made of the damaged and  total seeds in the cone. The data were recorded as  percentage cones infested, percentage seeds destroyed  and percentage of the total insect damage by each  species.  Cone Production and Seed Loss  Three methods of estimating numbers of cones per  tree from the ground by means of binoculars were tested  using 32 trees (the 30 trees sampled previously plus two  additional plot trees). On each tree, cones were counted  on the branch with the most cones (LBR), all cones on  the south side of the crown (SS) and all cones visible on  branches of the top two whorls of the tree (WHO).  These estimation counts were followed by actual counts  by climbing. The data were subjected to multiple regres­sion  ana lysis. Prediction equations were derived from  the binocular counts and used to estimate cone produc­tion  and seed losses per tree and per acre.  RESULTS  Damage Evaluation  Dissection revealed that 54 percent of the cones were  infested by insects (one or more seeds destroyed). Seed  losses in these infested cones averaged 17.0 percent; 6.4  percent of the seeds in all collected cones was destroyed  by insects. I n the Gold Creek I area, 50 percent of the  sample cones were infested, and 8.0 percent of the seeds  destroyed in the sample cones; in GC 2, 57 percent of the  sample cones were infested and 3.5 percent of the seeds  destroyed in the sample cones; in GC 3, 60 percent of  the sample cones were infested and 5.8 percent of the  seeds in the sample cones were destroyed by insects.  Dioryctria abietella (Denis and Schiffermueller), a  coneworm, and Hylemya abiell's Huckett, a cone  maggot, accounted for about 90 percent of the insect  damage, destroying 5.7 percent of the seeds in the sam­ple  cones. The remaining 10 percent of the damage was  attributed to four other insect species or unknown  causes (Fig. I).  Prediction of Cone Production  There were no apparent differences between stands  in either vegetation or elevation, thus data from the  three stands were grouped for analysis. Of the three  binocular methods for estimating cone production per  tree, a simple linear regression model using as an in­dependent  variable (LBR) accounted for the least  amount of the variation in the total cone production per  tree (r' = 0.299). Simple linear regression models using  counts from the top two whorls (WHO) and the south  side (SS) as the independent variables had r' values of  0.719 and 0.769 respectively. Fitting second degree  polynomials using LBR, SS and WHO failed to  significantly increase r2 over the value associated with  the first degree polynomials.  Multiple regression analysis using the combined  variables WHO and SS improved the fit considerably (r'  = 0.806). and reduced the root error mean square (Table  3). The equation for predicting cones per tree, Y, is:  Y = -10.8 + 1.9 WHO + 1.5 SS.  The inclusion of variable LBR in this model failed to im­prove  its fit. Data for all variables are summarized in  Table 3.  DISCUSSION  The method for predicting cone production reported  in this study was developed on the basis of one year's  data. That year was one of exceptionally good cone  production; the method may not be as accurate in stands  of fair or average cone production. As 60 percent of the  total number of cones in the crown is counted using  binoculars, a conversion factor of 1.6 could be used to  give a quick estimate of the cones in the crown. This  conversion factor is slightly lower than the 1.7 reported  by Franklin (1968).  60  ...5 0 • E • .:&gt;  ~ 40  ,•  • u  I  •.. • c  ~20  c1'  10  I  111111 .;.:.:.:. ~~~fm 'll:'t  I i  .&gt;.~,.,'.i.i,.,I,I,~,.t:  1·1  KEY  Dab - Oioryctria abietella  H a - Hyle my a abietis  o sp- Dasineura: sp  Bcs -Barbara colfaxiana  siskiyouana  E sp - Earomyia sp  M p - Megastigmus pinus  unk -unknown  ·,•.. ... .....,• ... .. ,.1.•.• ..,.1... , ...1.... ., ..1...' .,•.. ..... . ., .1.., ....... ,~,t~:'  O-l  __ ~~ .. ,&gt;.:' .. ,~.:.:ij;i;i .,.I .:(.,.· .::. . ,[.:·~ .... ~~ __ ~~ __ '.~.~.~.:.~ .. ~ ~.:.r.f: ..  ~:.:.:.:,  Dab H a DspBcs Esp Mp unk  Fig. I. Percentage of insect-caused damage by species  from grand fir cones collected near Potlatch, Idaho,  1971.  Cone production in the study areas was high in 1971,  exceeding the number of .cones per tree classified as  ""good"" for grand fir in the Inland Empire (USDA  1965). However, seedling-sapling stocking was below  ""desirable,"" particularly in GC 2. and tended to be  aggregated.'  Kulhavy and Schenk (in press) found that cone and  seed insects tend to increase in grand fir cones if 2  years of moderate to good cone production occur in a  row. Thus, any cutting with regeneration as an objective  should not be conducted during a year of poor cone  production following 2 seasons of good production  because of the high insect populations relative to the  available cones.

Trees from the Athol , Elk City , Orofino and Bovill  areas of Idaho formed the data base. Each tree was felled  and the following information was recorded: species, total  tree height in feet , diameter in inches inside and o ut side  bark at the top of a I-foot stump, and diameter in inches  outside bark at breast height and at the bottom and top of  every even-numbered 8-foot section up the trunk.

This information and regression analYSis were used to  develop an equation to predict diameter inside bark at  breas t height and at the bottom and top of every even­numbered  8-foot section in the t ree. Usi ng SmaJian's  fo rmula , inside bark total cubic foot volume above a I-foot  stump was computed for each tree. Board foot volumes  above a I -foot stump were derived for each tree by dia­gramming  the small end of each 8-foot bolt into the maxi­mum  number of 2x2's, 2x3's and/or 2x4's that co uld be  recovered. Separate diagrams were constructed for each  I-inch diameter class. A 3/ 16-inch sawke rf and 8-foot mini­mum  board length were assumed. Green lumber dimensions  were determined from sta ndards set by the Western Wood  Prod ucts Association. 1  The authors are Assistant Professor, Pro fessor, Research  Technician and Associate Professor, respectively, University of  Idaho.

Ulliman  INTRODUCTION  Visual interpretation of LANDSAT false-color  composite imagery enabled the senior author to map land  uses for the entire state of Idaho in two months' time  during the summer of 1975. The mapping was part of the  initial stage of the Pacific Northwest Regional Com­mission's  Land Resources Inventory Demonstration Project;  results are now published in the form of black-line overlays  at scales of I :250 ,000, 1: 500,000 and I : 1,000,000.  METHODS  Compilation was done at I :250,000 on acetate sheets  taped to standard U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps of  The authors are, respectively, graduate assistant, professor,  and associate professor of remote sensing. College of Forestry.

Penciled originals  were retraced in ink on mylar, and the products sent to  the Cartographic Laboratory of the Department of Ge­ography,  University of Oregon, Eugene, where they were  generalized and reduced for reproduction at smaller scales.  The maps depict nine broad classes of use, those  termed "" Level I"" by Anderson et aJ. (I 972): water, urban  and built-up land, agricultural land, non forested wetland,  rangeland, forest land. permanent snow and icefields.  barren land, and tundra. In general, the first four types  were mapped to a minimum area of 160 acres (one-eighth  inch square at I :250,000), and the remainder to a mini­mum  of 640 acres (one-quarter inch square). No higher  degree of land-use classification was believed achievable  by visual interpretation from the imagery; this presumption  was largely confirmed in practice.  The usual order of map compilation was reversed in  this instance, in that ""ground truth"" information from Soil  Conservation Service (SCS) county land-use maps was  transferred to the acetate-overlaid I :250,000 sheets before  the LANDSAT images were interpreted. The SCS maps,  drawn to a scale of I : 126,570, employed most of the  categories of land use noted above. They were furnished by  the Boise office of the SCS, U. S. Department of  Agriculture.  l""' ~.,£  L ""'L , , ,  r  Fig. 1. A Map-O-Graph overhead projector was used to reduce  Soil Conservation Service land-use map detail to the scale of the  base maps.  Transfer was made by use of a Map-O-Graph Model  5S vertical overhead reflecting projector, which reduced the  SCS map detail to the USGS scale and projected it onto the  surface of a worktable (Fig. I). The II -inch-square dimen­sions  of the Map-O-Graph's aperture window limited the  extent of detail which could be transferred at once ; detail  had to be transferred to the acetate in successive patches,  with a new registration of the projected image - 5.5 inches  square - at each sh ift. Discrepancies between the SCS and  USGS base maps necessitated frequent minor adjustments  of scale; these incongruities , together with the instrument's  optical properties, limited the area of accurate registration  to a central zone about 4 inches square on the tracing  table . Survey lin es, roads, and watercourses were used  for registration, since the SCS maps lacked topographic  detail.  Registration was complicated by the fact that the  projected Map-O-Graph image of a hand-colored SCS map  was often too weak to be clearly seen against the bold  USGS map detail. However, with the USGS map and its  acetate overlay taped to a drawing board, it was easy to  insert a sheet of white paper between map and acetate,  so that the relevant portion of the USGS map could be  hidden or made visible during registration and transfer.  In registration, the paper could be manipulated to create a  ""flicker"" effect, with USGS and SCS images alternately  visible, as the drawing board was moved about to bring  them into congruence; during transfer, the paper could  be used to mask the USGS map as necessary, so that the  SCS detail could be discerned and delineated easily.  The SCS land-use type boundaries were penciled in  on the acetate, and the types coded with numerals I  through 9. Inconsis tencies in the SCS mapping, which  turned up with some frequency at county boundaries,  were left for later resolution through LANDSAT image  in terpretation.  The acetate-overlaid map sheets, with tr'!nsfe rred  SCS land-use detail, were then placed under a wide-base  Bausch & Lomb Zoom Transfer Scope (ZTS), and  LANDSAT false-color 1:1 ,000,000 7 x 7-inch transparen­cies  were put into regist ry with them for intepretation  (Fig. 2). A IX map lens was employed. The eyepieces were  focused on the map table, and the vert ical stage carrying  the transparency was moved into focus at a point within an  inch of its limit of rearward travel. Magnification of about  4.5X, as registered on the instrument's scale-adjustment  control knob , was then required to enlarge the transparency  to map scale. At this magnification, the limits of resolution  of the LANDSAT images began to be evident; further  enlargement did not seem to improve interpretability  enough to offset the accompanying reduction in field of  view.  The IX map lens of the ZTS allowed the interpreter a  circular 7 J-inch-diameter field of view on the map, which  corresponded to a 1.8-inch-diameter circle on the trans­parency.  As with the Ma p-O-Graph at an earlier stage,  detail transfer had to proceed patchwise; and, as before ,  fewer discrepancies between adjacent patches were en­countered  when the interpreter confined his work to a  cent ral circle of map about 5 inches in diameter, and did  not try to delineate the entire visible area. This made it  necessary to shift the field of view and realign the map and  image more frequently.  Fig. 2. On the Zoom Transfer Scope, illumination controls at the  operator's left allow him to view either the LANDSAT image (on  the vertical stage), or the map, or both at once. Scale, orientation  and stretch controls at his right permit matching of the two images.  TO CIRCULATE SEE  UfJRARIAN THIS FLOOR  The acetate-covered map was moved about on the  table in the first stages of each registration; then it was  taped down while final adjustments were made with the  controls of the ZTS. In addition to the scale control, the  instrument has X and Y screw adjustments for the map  lens, an image-rotation fingerwheel, and a lever and finger­wheel  which permit the operator to ""stretch"" the image in  any direction to fit the map. The ability simultaneously to  distort the LANDSAT image and to vary the direction of  the distortion was invaluable in fitting image to map, even  though the amount of stretch employed was always small.  It was found advisable to zero the stretch controls with  every shift of field , and then to make the best possible job  of registration with the other controls before calling the  stretch adjustments into play ; it was equally wise to center  the X and Y screws of the map lens before each change  of field.  Roads, property lines, and topographic features  were all used in registration; in mountainous terrain , ridges  and drainages appearing on the LANDSAT images could be  matched to base-map contours with precision. It was often  helpful to vary the intensity of both direct lighting on the  map. and ""transillumination"" through the transparency,  during registration and detail transfer.  The fo llowing LANDSAT images were used:  ERTS-E-1035-17525  -1072-17580  -1272-18092  -1308-18095  -1342-1 7592  -1358-17465  -1358-17474  -1379-18041  -1380-18084  -1411-17404  -1411-17410  -1415-18022  -1415-18024  -1701-17451  -1701 -17460  -1702-17512  -t 703-1 7572  -1720-17495  -1720-17502  27 Aug 72  3 Oct 72  21 Apr 73  27 May 73  30 Jun 73  16 Jut 73  t6 Jut 73  6 Aug 73  7 Aug 73  7 Sep 73  7 Sep 73  11 Sep 73  l1 Sep73  24 Jun 74  24 Jun 74  25 Jun 74  26 Juo 74  13 Jut 74  13 Jul 74  Because these images covered the state with limited  overlap. there were few opportunities for direct comparison  of imagery taken at different seasons. Some seasonal  differences among images were obvious, however. and fall  imagery was observed to confer some advantages , as noted  later.  INTERPRETATION  Interpretation of the registered LANDSAT images  allowed considerable redrawing and refinement of the  SCS land-use type lines; this was especially the case in  wildland areas , where SCS mapping had been done with  a broad brush. Of course, the arrangement of the work,  with LANDSAT interpretation super-imposed upon SCS  mapping, allowed no assessment of what might have been  accomplished by use of LANDSAT imagery alone and  unaided. Further comments on LANDSAT interpretation  are perhaps best arranged by land-use type.  Water  There was no mistaking open water on LANDSAT  false-color composites. Clear, deep water was a dark blue­black,  and shallow or turbid water a pastel blue; neither  color resembled anything else. Where deeply-colored vege­tation  bordered on water, strong transillumination was  necessary for adequate perception of edge detail.  Urban and Built-up Land  Settlements and industrial sites usually appeared  mottled blue-grey. with occasional streaks of white or  light yellow, and strips and patches of dull rose-red which  denoted vegetation. Base maps usually indicated the posi­tions  of such sites. Topographic location provided other  obvious clues; a barren mountaintop, however blue-grey,  was not likely to be mistaken for any work of man.  Although high-intensity commercial, industrial, and  residential areas were fairly easy to identify, urban borders  were not always readily delineated ; the interpreter who  tries to draw a meaningful line through the maze of agri­cultural,  range and low-intensity commercial/residential  land surrounding a city like Boise, gains new respect for the  aptness of the term ""urban sprawl."" Small towns tended  to show more definite borders.  The devegetated zone surrounding the Kellogg  smelter was conspicuous and easily delineated, and fell  into tllis category of use both by definition (Anderson et al.  1972) and appearance.  Agricul tural Land  Pattern , and to a lesser extent color. identified  agricultural lands. The rectangular arrangement of farm  fields was easily recognized, as were the disks which de­noted  center-pivot irrigation . There was a noticeable  disparity between the small (often flood-irrigated) fields in  regions of early settlement, and the larger (often sprinkler­irrigated)  fields of the more recently developed regions.  Fields appeared brilliant red when crops were growing,  and yellow to white just before and immediately after  harvest; fallow land and other patches of bare soil showed  blue-grey.  As with urban land, the typical agricultural use  pattern was strikingly obvious, but boundary areas often  comprised intricately interwoven land uses which posed  problems of definition as well as of delineation. It was  difficult , for example, to decide at what point improved  rangeland might qualify as agricultural land.  1:1[  j  Nonforested Wetland  Topographic situation, evident both from the base  map and from the imagery , was key in locating this use  type ; the difficulty lay in distinguishing it from wet  meadowland, an agricultural type. Wetlands usually showed  a dusky·pink color, the bright red of their vegetation muted  somewhat by the darker water below, but this circumstance  was subject to seasonal change . In general, broad expanses  of low-lying land adjacent to water bodies and lacking  regular agricultural patterns were interpreted as wetland.  Rangeland  This was the most variable of the land·use types ,  including essentially all wildland·bearing non-forest vegeta·  tion: unforested brushy slopes in the mountains, sage/grass  foothills, and salt desert flats. Nothing was easier to find  than rangeland on LA DSAT imagery of Idaho, yet to  decide precisely at what point rangeland shaded into  forest, or into barren land , or into agricultural land ,  demanded close attention and carefully framed definitions  of each type.  Springtime imagery tended to obscure distinctions  between rangeland and other vegetational types; all  appeared in a similar fluorescent red. Such imagery might  have improved discrimination between range and barren  land , were it not that much of Idaho's barren land is under  snow in the spring. Fall imagery was best for separating  rangeland from forest ; by September, range types on  mountain slopes had turned grey-brown, while fore sts had  retained a rusty-red hue.  Beyond the forested mountains, most desert land was  classified as range . However. the most recent lava flows in  the Snake River Plain , distinctly visib le as dark·grey ir·  regular patches against the browner rangeland, were classed  as barren land . Outlines of rangeland fires were clearly  visib le; the burned areas appeared dark grey, like the color  of lava flows , but much smaUer in extent. Near the  southern border of the state , distinctions between pinyon­juniper  rangeland and forested land became difficult.  Forest Land  In most imagery, forest vegetation was distinguishable  from other types by its dense, darker tone - a red of higher  saturation and lower brilliance than that of agricultural  land - and its topographic location. Fall imagery was best  for separating forest land from interspersed range. Clearcut  patches were easily distinguishable, but some sites de·  forested by fire may have been misclassified as rangeland.  Permanent Snow and Icefields  Only late summer and early fall imagery were ade·  quate to support this interpretation. In imagery taken  earlier in the year, snow blanketed barren land above  timberline , and probably obscured some forest land as well.  Snow and ice are brilliant white in color on LANDSAT  imagery ; they are distinguishable from clouds by their  location and absence of shadow.  Barren Land  As noted earlier, this type exists at the extremities  of the forest-range continuum. Barren land was identified  in the lava flows (and bright, cream-white colored sand  dunes) of the desert, and in the rocky slopes above timber·  line . In the latter case, image tone was usually that of bare  soil and rock, light blue·grey to white.  Tundra  This type was delineated , with great hesitancy, in  a few above·timberline areas that lay too high to be called  range , and were too well vegetated to be called barren.  In some images this type was doubtless hidden by snow;  late summer imagery is necessary for any degree of  accuracy in depicting this type.  A V Al LABILITY  The published land·use overlays are available from  Northwest Cartographics, 2945 Hilyard Street, Eugene,  Oregon 97405. Base maps and four other kinds of thematic  overlays, compiled from various sources and illustrating  drainage, soils, land ownership, and energy features, were  prepared during Phase I of the Land Resources Inventory  Demonstration Project , and may be obtained from the  same source at all three scales. The I :250,000 overlays,  printed on Cronaflex, cost $355 per set of 20; the  I : 500,000 and I : 1,000,000 overlays - each covering the  entire state in a single c1ear·fiIm sheet - cost $81 and $63,  respectively. Compatible maps and overlays of Washington  and Oregon are also available.  LITERATURE CITED  Anderson, J.R. , E.E. Hardy, and J.T. Roach. 1972.

The dominant species in these forests are broadleaf  trees similar to those found in European and American  deciduous forests. OUf research in the Caspian forests  revealed severe damage caused by the brown· tail moth,  Euproctis chryso""hoea L. (Fig. I), especially to · trees  found at low and middle altitudes of the forest belt.  DISTRIBUTION  The brown-tail moth is found in all European and  Middle Eastern countries, especially in the Mediterranean  region. We found the moth and its natural parasite, the  tachinid fly (Fig. 2), throughout the Middle East and Iran.  DAMAGE  The damage caused by E. chryso""hoea is evident  in most deciduous forest trees, fruit trees and shrubs.  The authors are professors in the Colleges of Agriculture and  Natural Resources, respectively, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran.  The following were found to serve as host species: Populus  spp., Salix spp., Ulmus campestris, Quercus castaneaefolia,  Carpinus hetulus, Fagus orientalis, Mespi/us germanica,  Crataegus spp., Prunus pailus, Pirus malus, Prunus  communis, Pnmus avium, P1unus cerasus, and TUia rubra.  LIFE CYCLE  The brown·tail moth overwinters as a first instar larva  (Fig. 3). The adult moth emerges during June or July. The  female lays about 500 eggs in clusters of up to 300 eggs  and covers the egg mass with scales and ""tufts"" from the  abdomen. The larvae hatch in about 8 to 15 days. The  first instar larvae feed together inside twisted leaves. The  infested leaf dries up by fall and provides a secure shelter  for the over-wintering larvae. In spring the larvae begin  feeding on new foliage, and pupation takes place in May­June.  Thus the I-generation cycle is completed in I year.  CONTROL  The brown-tail moth can be controlled by two  different methods - burning the infested foliage or spray­ing  the foliage with chemicals. Tachinid flies are the only  natural parasites of the brown-tail moth, but they are  unable to effectively destroy this insect. Therefore, chemi­cal  control through the use of systemic insecticides is  recommended.  REFERENCES  Adeli, E., and A. Yakhkeshi. 1976. Pages 131·132 in Protection  farestier. Public.

These factors  continue to be a foremost consideration in the minds of  architects. Of all building materials, wood has fostered  the warmest atmosphere, with highly artistic and aesthetic  characteristics. Wood has been used to fulfill man's spiritual  and creative needs in places of worship. palaces and histori·  cal buildings.  The Temple of Solomon, which took 7 years to  build, was completed in 1012 BC, when there were few  craftsmen with the skill to hew timber like the Sidonians.  The roof and walls of the temple were panelled with  cedar carved with figures of cherubim. The floors were of  cypress wood overlaid with gold; the doors were of olive  wood carved and inlaid like the walls. The folding temple  door was of cypress on posts of olive wood, likewise  carved and gold inlaid.

In 1958 a few samples of charcoal  were found in the ruins of Persepolis, and although the  samples were almqst disintegrated , anatomical studies  revealed that they belonged to the genus Cedrus. This  wood was imported by Darius the Great from Lebanon to  Susa and Persepolis for use as posts and beams. It has  also been conjectured that Cedrus deodora Lood, or  Kashmere cedar, was imported from India and Pakistan  for use as posts and columns in the construction of  Persepolis.  Architectural Styles During the Safavid Dynasty  (506-1730 AD)  Manifestations of the unique architectural styles of  Iran appeared during the period 500-1730 AD. Many  palaces were built by the Safavid dynasty during this era.  The golden prime of Iran's architecture was reached in the  Middle Ages during the reign of Shah-Abbas the Great.  This versatile, dynamic monarch decided to build himself a  capital which would bring added glory to his vast empire.  Out of that golden dream emerged a great city, Isfahan ­""  half the world,"" as its proud citizens called it (and some  still do). Wooden columns of sycamore were used in the  palace of Ali-Ghapou. The large door of this palace had  been brought from the shrine of Ali in Hajaf by Shah­Abbas  the Great in order to maintain his empire by the  power and virtue of Ali. Thus it is called the Door of Ali  Palace.  Chehel-Sotoun (the Palace of Forty Columns) was  built in Isfahan during the reign of Shah-Abbas II (I057  Hejri, 1647 AD)_ The roof, which is panelled with plane  and walnut , is similar to that at Persepolis. The 20 posts  are of plane (Sycamore - Platanus oriontalis L.). Chehel­Sotoun  is the largest of all existing wood frame buildings  in Iran (Fig. I).  Fig. I. Chehel-Sotoun, the Palace of Forty Columns.  Ali Qapu is a seven-story palace located in the  Nagash-e-Jahan square. It was built by the order of Shah­Abbas  the Great in the early years of the II th century of  Hejri (17th century AD). The posts are of plane. The  interior decoration was improved and altered in 1054  Hejri (I644 AD), the period of Shah-Abbas II , by a famous  artist called Reza Abbassi.  MODERN ARCHITECTURAL TRENDS  Today the trend is toward erecting smaller buildings  exerting a greater influence in community life, such as  modern educational and recreational facilities. The use of  wood in many structural and decorative forms harmonious­ly  binds present-day Iran to the past. As new techniques  and building concepts are developed , a great need arises  for the use of wood in many structural and decorative  forms (Fig. 2).  One of the best and most economical of modern  structural and decorative techniques is glued , laminated  wood construction. Exposed, glued , laminated wood  arches provide desired architectural beauty. The exacting  requirements of educational designs 3re effectively met in  graceful lines and high structural performance. Economy,  appearence and ease of construction have made the lami­nated  rafter type of construction popular. Its inherent  strength, performance and economy comprise a combina­tion  seldom matched.  Lamellar construction is another type of wood roof  construction that needs no ceiling coverage because of the  decorative effect of the lamellae. Lamellar construction is  not often used in agricultural buildings, but is popular for  recreational buildings and other places of assembly.  One of the most important engineering advances in  the use of wood for home construction has been the  development of the trussed rafter system of roof framing.  The connector system of timber construction is highly  popular with architects for smaller buildings. Both exposed  and concealed roof construction is possible with trussed  rafters, triangulars, scissors, and trusses.  Present Traditional Wooden Houses in the Caspian Region  Iran is now in a great building period; construction  ranges from small rural farmhouses to large educational  and recreational buildings. Wood is in plentiful supply in  the Caspian region; therefore, it is one of the most econom·  ical materials available for home construction. It is a  widely-used material, having the best record of satisfactory  performance. Improvements in farm housing that have been  developed in the last few years shows that the home can be  much more satisfying for living and growing happily,  healthfully and graciously, with timber the only building  material renewed by nature as we use it. Because wood  is a natural and familiar material, it imparts a feeling of  security and well-being. Its many forms and colors provide  beauty in both exteriors and interiors of modern homes.  Fig. 2.

UttIe is known about rapt or populations in  an environment unaltered by man's activities. Conse­quently.  this wilderness expanse was selected as an area  for studying birds of prey. The purpose of this investigat ion  was to determine the relative frequencies and densities of  raptors that breed in representative natural habitat types  found in the Idaho Primitive Area.  STUDY AREA  The study area is located along 69.2 km (43 miles)  of Big Creek, from its mouth on the Middle Fo rk of the  Salmon River upstream to the Big Creek Ranger Station  (Fig. I).

Vegetation within the Big Creek Drainage study area  consisted of 58 percent coniferous fo rest, 40 percent grass­land  and 2 percent riparian habitat (Fig. 2). A more  detailed description of the st udy area can be found in  Horn ocker (I 970) and Seidensticker et al. (I 973}.  METHODOLOGY  The study area was surveyed throughout the summer  (20 May to 3 August 1977) in a systematic manner involv­ing  approximately 1070 km of travel (665 miles; 440 miles  on foot , 225 miles on horseback). The Big Creek Trail,  which closely follows Big Creek, served as a convenient  route for a census of th e study area. Side trails were also  used to survey the study area in more detail.  Nest sites were recorded when found, but the primary  emphasis was on determining raptor nesting ranges and  assessing densities of the va rious species inhab iting the  study area. Binoculars were used when needed to confirm  identifications. Sightings of paired and single raptors were  plotted on IS-minute topographic maps. Even though  '''.'

RESULTS  Twelve species were recorded within the study area  during this investigation: goshawk (Accipiter gentilis),  Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii), sharp-shinned hawk  (Accipiter striatus), marsh hawk (Circus cyaneus), red­tailed  hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) , golden eagle (Aquila  chrysaetos), kestrel (Falco sparverius), screech owl (Otus  asio) , great-horned owl (Bubo virginianus), long-eared  owl (Asio otus), saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus), and  pygmy owl (G/aucidium gnoma). In addition to these, the  common raven (Corvus corax), which also has raptorial  habits, was sighted frequently , and an osprey (Fandion  haliaetus) has previously been reported (IO and 12 June  1976) in the Chamberlain Basin portion of the primitive  area.  r: J i':f I ,', I  Mo"",moo'o' 9  Creek  Middle  Fork  of  Salmon  1,0  Fig. 2, General habitat distribution in the Big Creek study area.

Nesting chronology near the  mouth of Big Creek was 2 to 3 weeks ahead of that  40.2 km (25 miles) upstream. In this segment of the drain­age  there is an elevation difference of 427 m (1400 ft).  Young began to fledge in mid-June near the mouth of Big  Creek, and the last pair fledged on 22 July near Monu­mental  Creek (Fig. 1). Kestrel territories did not extend  much farther upstream. Beyond this point the vegetation  on the south-facing slopes changes from grassland to  coniferous forests of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponaerosa),  Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and, at higher eleva­tions,  lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The chronology of  plant development exhibited roughly the same time lag  as the kestrel reproductive cycle between the sites at the  mouth of Big Creek and at Monumental Creek.  Twenty-three pairs of kestrels had a nesting range  which included at least part of the study area. Most of the  land area covered by grasses or brush was used by at least  one pair. The average size of the nesting range (n=23)  was 1.76 km2 (0.68 square miles; Table I).  Because Big Creek runs primarily west to east, the  south and north slopes of the drainage support quite  different types of vegetation. The north-facing slope was  covered predominantly by Douglas-fir; sou th-facing slopes  supported mainly bunchgrass (Agropyron spicatum) and  balsam root (Balsamorhiza sagittata). Since kestrels are  adapted to the open country, the vegetation greatly  influenced their utilization of the study area. Other factors  which seemed to influence territory size and site selection  were topography_location of favorite hunting perches,  location of the nest site, and relative abundance of prey.  Figure 3 illustrates the size and shape of some of the kestrel  nesting ranges. These ranges appeared to be roughly rec­tangular.  Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper's Hawk and Goshawk  The sharp-shinned hawk was the second most  common hawk on the study area and was usually observed  Table 1.

Since this type of habitat was often discontinuous  in the study area, nesting sites frequently were isolated.  The average nesting range (n=7) was 0.85 km2 (0.33 square  mile; Table I) and the range was generally structured to  follow a waterway. Consequently, several nesting ranges  were long and narrow (Fig. 3). Cooper's hawks and gos­hawks  were observed in more variable habitat than were  sharp-shinned hawks.  Red-tailed Hawk and Marsh Hawk  Both red-tailed hawks and marsh hawks have been  observed to nest within the study area in previous years,  but neither species was recorded nesting in the drainage  in 1977_ Red-tailed hawks were found nesting in the  higher meadows of Chamberlain Basin outside the study  area, while breeding marsh hawks were completely absent  from the study area and also from nest sites recorded in  Chamberlain Basin the previous year. One female marsh  hawk was observed in the Big Creek Drainage on 3 August  1977.  Golden Eagle  Four pairs of golden eagles included the study area as  part of their nesting range; two of those pairs actually  nested in the study area. Colonies of Columbian ground  squirrels (Spermophilus co[umbiallus) in burned areas  and a colony of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota  j/aviventris) in talus were hunted regularly by these eagles.  Overlap of eagle nesting ranges occurred at the peripheries,  especially near favored hunting areas; however, these areas  of mutual use were not observed to be hunted by different  pairs at the same time. The average area of golden eagle  nesting ranges (n=2) was 69_9 km2 (27 square miles;  Table I).  Raven  Nesting ranges of this species tended to be widely  separated from each other. Only the area close to the nest  was vigorously defended against other ravens or hawks.  A nesting range of 8.29 km2 (3.2 square miles; Table I)  was determined for one regularly observed pair.  Owl  The owls were difficult to count because of their  nocturnal habits. Nevertheless, representatives of the five  species of owls previously recorded in the area were Sighted  throughout the summer. All of these were found in the  Douglas-fir habitat which was the most abundant forest  cover in the study area. The long-eared owl and great­horned  owl were also found in lodgepole pine forests of  the Chamberlain Basin. The screech owl and long-eared  owl are additions to the bird checklist compiled for the  Idaho Primitive Area by Seidensticker and Welch (1972).  Additional studies, especially those utilizing prerecorded  cails, should increase sightings of owls in the area.  4  0.5  mil~  Fig. 3. Nesting ranges of the kestrel (solid-lined enclosures) and the  sharp-shinned hawk (broken-lined enclosures) on a portion of the  Big Creek study area, 1977.  DISCUSSION  The two most abundant raptors recorded in the Big  Creek Drainage of the Idaho Primitive Area were the kestrel  and the sharp-shinned hawk. They comprised 68 percent  and 20 percent, respectively, of the recorded nesting  raptors. In general, the kestrel confined its activities to  open country; the sharp-shinned hawk resided almost  exclusively in open forest and riparian habitats. [n grass­land  habitat kestrel density averaged 4.3 pairs per 10 km2  (J I.J pairs/lO square miles). The average nesting range  of 1.76 km2 is within the average range recorded by Craig­head  and Craighead (1956) for II pairs of kestrels  (2.02 km2 in Wyoming) and by Balgooyen (J 976) for  32 pairs (1.09 km2 in California). Lack (1966) and Brown  (1969) concluded that the size of kestrel territories serves  to space in clivi dual pairs in the available habitat. The  maximum density recorded for sharp-shinned hawks in  riparian habitat and in park-like stands of conifers was  1_9 pairs per 10 km2 (5.0 pairs/IO square miles). The  average nesting range of 0_86 km2 corresponds to a nesting  range of 1.1 km2 obtained in Wyoming for two pairs of  sharp-shinned hawks (Craighead and Craighead 1956).  Virtually all of the grassland habitat was well  surveyed and therefore all of the kestrel pairs that utilized  the study area were probably recorded. Most of the riparian  habitat was well searched, but because the viewing distance  in forested habitat is limited by trees, only about 40  percent of this latter type of habitat was adequately sur­veyed.  Therefore, woodland hawk populations (sharp­shinned  hawks, Cooper's hawks and goshawks) are probably  larger than our census indicated. Consequently, it is reason­able  to estimate that 13 pairS of sharp-shinned hawks  utilized the study area for nesting. In forested habitat an  average of 1.6 nesting pairs of sharp-shinned hawks could  be expected per 10 km2 (4.2/10 square miles).  The golden eagle was the other major component  of the raptor population. These birds preyed extensively  upon scattered colonies of Columbian ground squirrels.  Their relatively large nesting ranges, averaging 70 km2,  reflect the territory size necessary to support a breeding  pair. This compares with an average nesting range of  93 km2 in California (Dixon 1973) and 70 km2 in  Scotland (Lockie 1964).  Why were there no intermediate-sized hawks such  as red-tailed hawks and marsh hawks in the study area  this year, when they have nested there in previous years?  We hypothesize that the lack of moisture may be involved.  The low spring runoff for the last several winters has caused  ground water reserves to become depleted; consequently,  above-ground stream flow has decreased or ceased alto­gether.  New plant growth and seed production were there­fore  probably less this year, and plants went into winter  dormancy earlier. These events may have affected the  songbird and small mammal populations dependent on  these plants, in turn affecting the raptors that prey on  the small birds and mammals. By the middle of July ,  kestrels that had fledged their young began to disperse.  By the end of July most of the sharp-shinned hawks also  began to migrate from the area as their songbird prey base  diminished.  To examine what effect these dry conditions may  have had on the prey base, a brief census of the small  mammal population was conducted. In late July we re­trapped  on some of the transects which had been sampled  in June of the previous year. Three hundred trap nights  were recorded in the bunchgrass habitat and 100 trap  nights in riparian habitat. Four adult deer mice  (Peromyscus maniculatus) were taken; neither of the  two females trapped was pregnant. This compares with  26 mice taken from the same areas for the same number  of trap nights the preceding year. As indicated above, these  data suggest that small mammal populations may have  been depressed from the preceding year and the decline  in raptor populations on the study area may have reflected  this decline in prey base. Balgooyen (1976) hypothesized  that the difference between nesting range sizes in his  kestrel data and in that presented by Craighead and  Craighead (1956) was a function of available prey. Both  red-tailed hawks and marsh hawks also prey heavily on  5  small rodents (Craighead and Craighead 1956) and both  species have previously been known to nest in the study  area . However, in 1977, red-tailed hawks were restricted  to the wetter mountain meadows and marsh hawks were  entirely absent from the nesting population.  Apparently the available prey base was still sufficient  to support the smaller raptor species, but these also left  as soon as their young had been fledged. By August only a  few representatives of these smaller species remained.  The possibility of using the Big Creek Drainage  as a release site for species such as the prairie falcon (Falco  mexicanus) definitely has merit. Suitable nesting cliffs  exist from Mile Hi to Cabin Creek and also near the mouth  of Big Creek. The level of human disturbance would be  low. Columbian ground squirrels are present in the Mile  Hi area in large concentrations and could serve as a food  base. If the formerly irrigated pastures near Cabin Creek  are allowed to be recolonized by the ground squirrels, this  food base would increase substantially.  SUMMARY  The objective of this study was to gather preliminary  information on the densities of raptors in the pristine  habitat of the Idaho Primitive Area. Between mid-May and  early August, 12 raptor species were recorded in the study  area along Big Creek. The most abundant species was the  kestrel , inhabiting the grassland habitat at a species density  of 4.3 pairs per 10 km2. The sharp-shinned hawk was the  most common woodland dweller and restricted its nesting  to open forest and riparian habitats. The estimated density  of this species was 1.9 nesting pairs per 10 km2 of suitable  habitat.  It is hypothesized that due to drought conditions  in the study area this year, the small mammal prey base  was depressed. This may have resulted in the absence of  red-tailed hawks and marsh hawks from the study area ,  where they had nested the previous year. The dry condi­tions  also may have forced resident raptOI;s to migrate  from the study area earlier than usual.  LITERATURE CITED  Balgooyen, T.G. 1976.

W. Tisdale  INTRODUCTIO  The grasslands of the Middle Snake River Valley con·  stitute, along with those of major tributaries such as the  Salmon and Clearwater, a unique and important vegeta·  tion region of Idaho. The total area occupied by these  grasslands in Idaho is about 486,000 hectares (1.2  million acres), perhaps half of which occurs in the area  included in the present study. Similar grasslands occur  on the west side of the Snake River in Oregon and  Washington.  Due to its rugged topography, dry climate and stony  soils, most of this grassland region has remained un­cu  ltivated. A mild winter climate and high quality  forage provide choice grazing for both domestic  livestock and wildlife. The grasslands stabilize steep  slopes where accelerated erosion would be disast rous to  water quality in the Snake River system. Recreational  values are also high - much of the study area has  recently ' been designated the Hells Canyon National  Recreation Area.  These grasslands were used primarily by wildlife,  before the coming of white settlers, although by the late  ~ 800s horses acquired by the Nez Perce Tribe were  u "" 9 The author is Professor Emeritus of Range Management with the lb .

White settlement became widespread after  1870, int roducing large herds of cattle and sheep which  often were grazed on a yearlong basis (Eva ns 1967).  Most of the more accessible grassland became depleted.  While much remains so at the present time, difficult  access, precipitous slopes and lack of water have acted  to protect some areas from overuse. Better range  management has improved others. As a result, the study  area contains numerous examples of relatively un­disturbed  vegetation, particularly in the central portion,  where white settlement was sparse and heavy livestock  use was restricted to lands close to homesteads.  The study area includes the main valley of the Snake  and its immediate tributaries from the area around  Lewiston in the north to Brownlee Dam at the south end  (Fig. I). I ncluded are portions of Nez Perce, Idaho,  Adams and Washington counties in Idaho; Whitman  and Asotin in Washington; and Wallowa and Baker in  Oregon. Most of the study was conducted in Idaho; a  few sites were sampled and observations made in the  other two states.  The tota l length of this area is about 192 km (120  miles); the width varies from about 2 to 25 km (1.2 to  15.5 miles). The topography is rugged, with elevation  ranging from a low of 214 m (700 ft) on the valley noor  near Lewiston to 2800 m (9185 ft) on the mountains for­ming  the canyon rim. Grasslands occur from the valley  noor to elevations of about 2400 m (7870 ft), but are  ~ Universityotldaho  WASHINGTON  ENTERPRISi.

Parts of the canyon have steep rock walls,  but generally the valley sides rise in a series of slopes  ranging from 20 to over 100 percent gradient. The ma­jority  of grassland slopes have gradients of 50 to 75 per­cent  (Fig. 2).  Climatic data are limited to stations at Lewiston and  Brownlee Dam. Both stations are located near the valley  bottom. Mean annual precipitation and temperature  data for these stations are presented below.  562  431  Mean Precip (mm) % Mean Temperature (""C)  Station Annual Nov- Mar Nov-Mar Annual Jan July  Brownlee 407  Lewiston 329  249  150  58.5  45.5  11 .9 -0.1 26.5  11.1 -0.3 23.3  The south end of the area is slightly warmer, but receives  more precipitation than the north end. No data are  available for intermediate points in the canyon.  The moisture pattern is characterized by a high  percentage of winter precipitation, mainly in the form of  rain. Mild winter climate is shown by the relatively high  mean temperatures for January, and by the presence of  di sj uncts such as Cellis relieulala (hackberry), a species  found primarily in the southwestern states.  The soils of the area are derived primarily from  Columbia River basalt or the older Seven Devils  volcanics, along with varying amounts of quaternary  loess. Recent alluvial deposits are found in limited areas  •  on stream fans and terraces. Most of the grassland soils  have formed on relatively steep slopes and contain a  mixture of residual and colluvial materials. The soils are  relatively stony, and depth varies greatly with aspect and  slope. Textures range from loamy-sand to clay loam,  with loams and silt loams most common. Taxonomical­ly,  loamy-skeletal Argixerolls and Haploxerolls  predominate (Barker 1976, 1978; Soil Conservation Ser­vice  1975).  The vegetation of the study area consists mainly of  grassland at the lower and middle elevations, with con­iferous  forest above. There is much interfingering of  forest and grassland, however, due to differences in  aspect. Communities dominated by shrubby species in­cluding  Cereoearpus ledifolius (curlleaf mountain  mahogany), Celtis retieulata, Amelanehier alnifolia (ser­viceberry)  and Prunus emarginata (bitter cherry) occupy  limited areas in the canyon. A narrow band of riparian  vegetation along the river and its tributaries is  dominated by Alnus rhombifolia (white alder) (Miller  and Johnson 1976).  The southern end of the study area lies in the ecotone  between the Pacific Northwest bunchgrass region and  the sagebrush-grass or sagebrush steppe region.  PREVIOUS STUDIES  Little published information exists on the vegetation  of the study area or of the canyon grasslands of the  Pacific Northwest. Daubenmire's (1970) detailed study  of the steppe vegetation of Washington covers the  Palouse and Columbia Basin areas but not the canyon  of the Snake River or its tributaries. Daubenmire  described several habitat types dominated by either  Agropyron spicatum or Festuca idahoensis. Most infor­mation  relating directly to the study area occurs in  theses and papers from the University of Idaho.  Campbell (1962) studied vegetation dominated by F.  idahoensis at the northern end. On a basis of very limited  sampling he described two climax communities:  Agropyron spicatum/ Festuca idahoensis and Festuca  idahoensis/ Koeleria cristata. Evans (1967) and Evans  and Tisdale (1972) reported on studies of lower eleva­tion  grasslands, mainly in the Salmon River drainage.  Emphasis was on the ecology of A. spicatum and  Aristida longiseta (three awn). Two seral communities  based on soil differences were recognized, both in the A.  spieatllm series. Huschle (1975) was primarily concerned  with a narrow strip of land immediately adjacent to the  Snake River, but his studies included some upland  vegetation. Although most of his sites were in depleted  condition, he described a climax Agropyron  spicatum/ Poa sandbergii community which appeared  more mesic than that recognized by Daubenmire (1970)  in Washington.  Fig. 2. Typical rough topography and grassland vegetation of the Mid·  die Snake River Canyon. Soils and vegetation are well developed on  Sleep slopes (foreground), but considerable bare rock outcrop occurs,  especially on south slopes (background).  METHODS  Field methods were designed for rapid sampling with  reasonable accuracy, and required only simple,  lightweight equipment. Most of the sites were reached  by extensive foot travel. A jet boat was used to reach  portions of the canyon not accessible by road.  Sampling was concentrated on areas selected to repre­sent  different portions of the study region. Criteria for  sample areas included a range of topographic situations  and soil types plus stands of vegetation in relatively un­disturbed  condition. Suitable areas were found in the  vicinity of Waha in the northern part, Sheep Creek in  the central part, and near the south end of the study  area.  Sampling involved the use of a macroplot for record­ing  general site characteristics and microplots for  detailed study of vegetation and soil surface features. A  macroplot of 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) was used, with 20  microplots, each 2 by 5 dm (8 by 20 inches) in size. These  Table I.

Plot locations were marked by  painted boulders or rock mounds and located on maps  and aerial photographs.  Physiographic data included elevation, aspect, per­cent  slope, and position on slope. Notes were made on  amount of erosion, signs of present and past grazing use,  and evidence of fire or other disturbance.  The soil profiles on each macro plot were exposed for  study with a pit. Parent material, profile development,  stoniness, solum depth, restrictive layers, etc. were  recorded. Samples were taken to determine texture, pH,  organic matter and color. Classification and  nomenclature were based on the U.S.D.A. Soil Tax­onomy  Handbook (Soil Conservation Service 1975).  Data obtained from the microplots included frequen­cy  of rooted vascular species, an estimate of their foliage  cover, and the percentage of cryptogams, litter, gravel  and bare ground on the soil surface. A species list was  made by inspecting the whole macroplot and adding  species present but not recorded on the microplots. Her­barium  specimens were collected for documentation,  with nomenclature based on Hitchcock and Cronquist  ( 1973).  Analysis of the data included preparation of associa­tion  tables and statistical treatment. The first order sort­ing  by cluster analysis was based on species presence or  absence, following which quantitative factors of fre­quency  and cover were considered. Classification was  based on the vegetation, but soils and physiographic  data. were correlated with vegetation and incorporated  Table 2. Vegetational and site characteristics of grassland habitat types.  into the description of each community. Soils were  classified to family and, where possible, to series levels.  [n recognizing communities, it was realized that the  vegetation of an area represents a continuum within  which groupings of similar stands can enhance un­derstanding  of ecosystems. In practice, physiographic  differences, especially aspect, produced reasonably  sharp boundaries for the communities recognized.  RESULTS  Forty-seven stands were sampled during the field  seasons of 1976 and 1977. Additional data were ob­tained  from 14 sites established earlier by Campbell  (1962) and Evans (1967). A summary of results is  presented in Tables I and 2. Analyses of these data in­dicate  the presence of two vegetational series. The series  is a group of vegetation systems, usually with a single  dominant climax species. [t corresponds to the term  ""vegetation zone"" used by many workers. The Festuca  idahoensis and Agropyron spicatum series recognized in  the present study belong in the Pacific Northwest  bunchgrass region.  Vegetational series are useful as a broad classification,  but the objective in the present study is recognition of  finer units. The habitat type is considered the basic  ecosystem unit, defined as ""the aggregate of all areas  that support or can support the same primary climax""  (Daubenmire 1970). The habitat type (ht) has relatively  uniform biotic and abiotic structure and is a primary  unit for management. The climax vegetation, considered  to give the most meaningful integration of environmen­tal  factors .affecting vegetation, provides recognition  features for habitat types (Steele et al. 1976, Hironaka  1977).

Phacelia heterophylla.  Scutellaria angustljolia -  Agropy ron spicatum/ Opuntia po/yacantha ht  FESTUCA SERIES  This series occurs in the moister and/ or cooler parts  of the grassland area. The elevational range of sites  sampled is from 540 to 1430 m (1770 to 4690 ft), but the  type at the lower elevations is confined to northerly  slopes. The series also extends to higher elevations. The  vegetation is characterized by the dominance of Fesluca  idahoellsis. Other common perennial grasses include  Agropyroll spicalum, Koeleria criSlala and Poa  sandbergii. A. spicatum is the most abundant of these  and is co-dominant with F. idahoensis in some cases.  Perennial forbs are abundant, with Achillea millefolium  va r. lanulosa . Balsamorhiza sagillata. Brodiaea  dOl/glasii, Caslilleja hispida, Lilhophragma parvijlora,  Lomalil/m Irilematum , Lupinus laxijlorus (spur lupine)  and L. sericeus most common. Annuals are less com­mon,  the only species with high constancy being a grass,  Brollll/s brizaeformis, and two dwarf forbs, Draba verna  and Slellaria nilens.  The soils have A horizons which are deep and dark  colored with an organic content of 4 percent or more in  the su rface 20 cm (8 inches). Most belong in the loamy­skeletal,  mixed, mesic Pachic Ultic or Ultic Argixerolls.  These well drained soils are dry in summer, but store  considerable moisture in the winter months. Dwarf  cryptogams and litter comprise most of the soil cover,  while gravel or rock and bare ground constitute much  smaller portions.  This series provides high quality forage best suited for  summer and fall use. It is relatively resistant to overgraz­ing,  but with continued overuse the cover of perennial  grasses and many perennial forbs is reduced , while an­nuals  and some perennial forbs increase.  HABITAT TYPES - FESTUCA SERIES  Fesll/ca idahoensis/ Koeleria cris/ala ht  This is the principal habitat type of the Fesluca series  in the study area. The vegetation is characterized by  dominance of F. idahoensis and constant occurrence of  Koeleria crislala. Agropyron spicalum is usually present  and often abundant, but with less cover than the F.  idahoensis. Perennial forbs constitute about 25 percent  of the total cover, with Achillea millefolium, Caslilleja  hispida, Lilhophragllla parvijlora, Hieracium alber/ilium,  Balsamorhiza sagillala and Calochor/us elegans most  common. Shrubs are represented only by Spireaea  betulifolia (shinyleaf spiraea) which occurs sparingly.  The soils are dark, with an average organic content of  7 percent. Most belong to the Lawyer series, a loamy­skeletal,  mixed, mesic Pachic Ultic Argixeroll, or to an  undescribed series which resembles Bluesprin, but is  darker and contains more organic matter. These  categories indicate relatively moist, cool conditions for  grassland soils, and correspond with the mesic nature of  the vegetation and the dominance of F. idahoensis. The  soil cover of dwarf cyptogams (lichens and mosses) and  litter is almost complete.  Festuca idahoensis/ Koeleria cristata represents a  habitat type not presently described in the published  literature, although Campbell (1962) used the term for  one of the communities described. It differs from any of  the habitat types described by Daubenmire (1970) in  eastern Washington.  This habitat type is highly productive and well suited  for summer and fall grazing. It is fairly resistant to  heavy grazing, but less palatable forbs such as Achillea  lIIillefolium and annuals increase with continued  overuse.  Festuca idahoensis/ Agropyron spicatum ht  This type occurs mainly in the drier parts of the study  area, at the north and south ends, usually on similar  aspects but slightly lower elevations than the Fesluca  idahoensis/ Koeleria crislala.  The vegetation is characterized by the shared  dominance of F. idahoensis and A. spicatum. virtual  absence of K. crislala, and by a lesser forb composition  and cover than that of the Fesluca / Koeleria. A  characteristic forb is Heuchera cylindrica, uncommon  elsewhere in the series. Shrubs are rare or lacking. The  soil cover of litter and cryptogams is comparable to that  in the Fesluca/ Koeleria, but gravel cover is higher.  Soils differ from those of the Fesluca/ Koeleria mainly  in having lower organic content and lighter color. They  belong mostly in the loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Ultic  or Lithic Ultic Argixerolls, but vary considerably.  Classification to series level has proved difficult to date,  although soils resembling Bluesprin, Riggins and even  Lawyer occur.  This community resembles in some respects the  Agropyron spicalum/ Fesluca idahoensis ht of Dauben­mire  (1970), yet differs considerably in species composi­tion.  Heuchera cylindrica, Balsamorhiza sagillata and  Eriogonum herac/eoides, all common in the Fesluca  idahoellsis/ Agropyron spicatum, are lacking in Dauben­mire's  Agropyron spicatum/ Fesluca idahoellsis. On the  other hand, Phlox longifolia and annuals such as Plan­tago  patagonica (Indian-wheat) and Festuca pacifica  (small fescue) are much more common in Daubenmire's  type. Differences also occur in physiography and soil s,  for Daubenmire's sites are mainly of gentle topography  with deep loessial soils.  Festuca idahoensis/ Symphoricarpos albus ht  This habitat type is confined to the northern end of  the study area, and sampling to date has been minimal  (4 stands). It occurs at middle elevations in the Festuca  series, on similar aspects to the Festuca idahoen­sis/  Koeleria cristata ht.  Vegetation ally it is closest to the Festuca/ Koeleria,  but differs in the presence of Symphoricarpos albus and  Rosa (nutkana/ woodsii), in the higher proportion of  Agropyron spicatum and in the less consistent occurence  of K. cristata. The soils are shallower, stonier, lower in  organic matter, and lighter in color than those of the  Festuca/ Koeleria. They seem closest to a dark phase of  Bluesprin, which is a loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Ultic  Argixeroll.  The presence of Symphoricarpos and Rosa might  suggest a more mesic comm unity than the  Festuca/ Koeleria, but the weight of evidence from  vegetation and soils indicates the opposite. This type  differs from the Festuca idahoensis/ Symphoricarpos  albus ht of Daubenmire (1970), which exceeds it greatly  in number and abundance of perennial forbs, as well as  in depth and fertility of soil.  AGROPYRON SERIES  These communities occupy the largest portion of the  canyon grasslands, extending from valley bottoms to  elevations of about \350 m (4430 ft). At higher  elevations they become increasingly confined to souther­ly  slopes and ridge tops.  The vegetation is characterized by the dominance of  Agropyron spicatum. The only other perennial grass of  high constancy, Poa sandbergii, usually constitutes only  a small part of the perennial grass cover. Annual  grasses, especially the bromes, occur commonly but with  little cover. A large number of perennial forbs occur, but  few species exhibit high constancy. The average number  of perennial forb species per site is only two-thirds that  of the Festuca series. The most common forbs are  Achillea millefolium, Balsamorhiza sagillata, LOlllatiulIl  triternatum, and Phlox spp. (P. colubrina and P.  longifolia).  Annual forbs are relatively sparse, the main species  being Draba verna, Stellaria nitens and Myosotis spp.  (forget-me-not). A succulent, Opunlia polyacanlha, is  common in one habitat type. Shrubs are sparse, with  Chrysothamnus nauseosus (rubber rabbitbrush) most  common. Soil cover consists of a low content of dwarf  cryptogams, moderate to dense litter, and a large  amount of surface gravel in one habitat type.  The soils are lighter colored, with lower organic con­tent,  more stones, and shallower horizons than those of  the Festuca series. Most are loamy-skeletal, mixed,  mesic Argixerolls, Haploxerolls or Xerorthents in­dicating  moisture and temperature conditions less  favorable than those in the Fesluca series.  This grassland is suited for fall and winter grazing and  can also be utilized in the spring if use is not continued  too long into the growing season. It is more easily dis­turbed  by heavy use than the Festuca series. Depletion is  shown by a decline in most perennials, especially  Agropyron spicalum, and by a marked increase in an­nuals,  including Bromus lec/Orum, other bromes and an­nual  forbs.  HABITAT TYPES - AGROPYRON SERIES  Agropyron spicalum/ Poa sandbergii (Idaho) ht  This habitat type is given the term ""Idaho"" to dis­tinguish  it from the Agropyron/ Poa described by  Daubenmire (1970). The ""Idaho"" type possesses a larger  number and greater total frequency of perennial forbs  than Daubenmire's habitat type. The more mesic annual  bromes, i.e. Bromus br;zae/ormis and B. japonicus. occur  commonly, but are rare or lacking in Daubenmire's  community. Huschle (1975) describes a similar  difference in annual brome species in samples of  Agropyron/ Poa in the middle Snake River Canyon. The  Agropyron/ Poa (Idaho) ht occurs throughout the study  area on slopes of relatively favorable aspect and on  deeper, less stony soils.  The vegetation is characterized by dominance and  abundant cover of A. spicatum, with P. sandbergii the  main ""filler"" species. Achillea millefolium, Balsamorhiza  sagillata, Phlox spp. (P. colubrina and P. longifolia ),  Lomalium triternalum and Brodiaea douglasii are the  most common perennial forbs. Shrubs are uncommon.  The ground surface is occupied mainly by litter and  dwarf cryptogams.  The soils are loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Calcic or  Ultic Argixerolls, most belonging to the Ta.1nahill series  or to one not yet named which shows some characters  resembling Bluesprin. These moderately deep soils  provide favorable growth conditions during the spring  months. Organic matter of the surface 20 dcm (8 inches)  averages just over 3 percent and the dry color of the A  horizon is dark grayish brown.  This is the most productive habitat type of the  Agropyron series.  Agropyron spicalum/ Opuntia polyacantha ht  This community occurs throughout the range of the  Agropyron series, but on drier sites, with more southerly  aspects than those occupied by the Agropyron  spicatum/ Poa sandbergii (Idaho) ht.  The vegetation is characterized by dominance of A.  spicatum, but with less cover than in the Agropyron/ Poa  ht. Poa sandbergii is sparse in cover and occasionally  absent. The perennial forb cover is less than that of the  Agropyron/ Poa and different in composition. The  characteristic species, Opuntia polyacantha, Phacelia  heterophylla and Scutellaria angusti/olia, belong to a  group associated with gravelly sites. The soil surface is  dominated by a gravel pavement which usually covers as  much area as cryptogams and litter combined.  The soils are shallower, stonier, lower in organic  matter and lighter in color than those of the  Agropyron/ Poa (Idaho) hI. Most are loamy-skeletal,  mixed, mesic Lithic Haploxerolls or Lithic Xerorthents  of the Lickskillet and Bakeoven series, respectively.  These are shallow, stony soils and constitute the poorest  sites for plant growth in the grassland area. Soils with  slightly deeper profiles also occur in this habitat type;  some of them resemble a shallow phase of Tannahill  series. The Agropyron/ Opuntia ht occupies the most  xeric aspects with the Agropyron series, and produces  less plant cover than the Agropyron/ Poa hI.  DISCUSSION  Within the confines of regional climate, topographic  variation constitutes the major ecological influence in  the study area. Aspect, and to a lesser degree elevation,  strongly inflence microclimate and hence the nature of  vegetation and soils. Steepness of slope appears to be a  lesser factor, at least up to the 75 percent limit set for  sampling in this study. Response to topographic varia­tion  has produced a mosaic of vegetation and soil types,  recognizable in the field and separable as taxonomic un­its.  One of the major objects of the current study is to in­vestigate  the relation between vegetation and soil units,  particularly at the level of habitat type and soil series.  Since vegetation and soils are developed by the same set  of formative factors (Jenny 1958), there should be a  close relationship. It is not total, however, for although  vegetation and soils develop together, they do not  directly determine one another (Major 1951). Further­more,  the taxonomic units of each are based on their  own characteristics, thus the properties used to separate  two soil series may not be critical for the vegetation of a  particular area.  Despite these reservations, significant correspondence  of vegetation and soils is shown in the present study.  Relationship between habitat types and soil series is well  marked for the two major habitat types, Festuca  idahoensis / Ko eleria cristata and Agropyron  spicatum/ Poa sandbergii (Idaho). In each case, two  closely related soil series are found conjoined with a  specific habitat type. The lesser degree of correlation for  the other three habitat types indicates a need for further  examination of both vegetation and soils of the areas in­volved.  A weakness of the present study has been lack of  joint field examination of vegetation and soils by  specialists in each of these disciplines. Identification of  soils from the study sites has been made on the basis of  my brief descriptions and from soil samples. The soil  surveys applicable to the study area were made at the  reconnaissance level and did not cover all units of  landscape, especially on the steep and relatively in­accessible  areas which contain much of the Snake River  grasslands.  I hope that this initial classification and description of  the principal grassland communities will be useful to  land managers and others concerned with the vegetation  of the area. Feedback and tests of these keys and  descriptions are needed to develop a more comprehen­sive  treatment of these canyon grasslands.

Christophersen, and Charles W. McKella  INTRODUCTION  There are 187 roadless areas con !aining 7.9 million  acres in Idaho's national forests. These areas have been  evaluated by the USDA Forest Service for possible wilder­ness  designation in the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation  process (RARE II) (USDA Forest Service 1978). An eco­nomic  and local impact analysis was also conducted at the  College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, University  of Idaho (McKetta et aI. 1978), using the Forest Service  data base. The latter study identified numerous areas which  rated high in wilderness benefits and simultaneously con­tained  substantial quantities of commercially valuable tim­ber.  These areas have the greatest potential for conllict in  the wilderness decision process.  Under the USDA Forest Service alternatives (except  H), entire roadless areas will be classified as either wilder­ness  or non-wilderness, or placed in a further planning  The authors are assistant professors of Forest Products and  Forest Resources, respectively. with the College of Forestry.

Presently,  roadless area boundaries are based on contiguous unroaded  acreages which must be a minimum of 5,000 acres per unit.  This boundary criterion offers little room for contlict  resolution. Each area is evaluated on an all-or-nothing basis  although the distribution and valueof resources contained  within it may not be uniform.  Conflict resolution could be achieved by changing  area boundaries such that a roadless area is defined on the  basis of resource character. The draft environmental impact  statement (EIS) for RARE II areas in Idaho recognized the  possibility of area subdivision but did not examine alter­native  ways of redefining boundaries. The Bighorn-Weitas  roadless area (1306), located in the Clearwater National  Forest, will be used as an example in which segregating  unlike resources could substantially reduce causes of  resource allocation conflict.  THE APPROACH  An area could be subdivided to reduce potential con­flict  by numerous criteria such as: administrative subdivision,  subdivision by site productivity, watershed boundary, con­tours,  individual stands, wilderness character, or by existing  land classifications. For simplicity, only the timber resource  ,,' .(.\;  fj Universityof Idaho  is considered as the basis for boundary redefmition in this  paper, although a combination of resource criteria should  be used in an operational boundary change proposal.  This case study subdivides areas based on existing  commercial timber land classifications from the USDA  Forest Service Manual, Section 2412.15: Standard, Special,  Marginal and Unregulated.  I. Standard-commercial forest land on which crops  of industrial wood can be grown and harvested  under the usual provisions of the timber sale  contract.  2. Special-areas needing timber resource treatment  specially designed to achieve landscape or other  key resource objectives.  3. Marginal-areas not qualifying as standard or  special, primarily due to excessive development  cost, low product cost, low product value or  resource protection constraints.  4. Unregulated- acreage that will not be organized  for timber production under sustained yield  principles. (Non-commercial, unproductive, and  water acreages were also included in this category  for analy tical simplicity.)  These timber land classifications are used only to  identify the potential for roadless area redefmition to reduce  the conflict with timber. This delineation is approximate,  and used for illustrative purposes. An actual boundary change  proposal might require additional detail in specific resource  measurements and separation criteria. This case study sub­area  delineation represents but one example of how area  boundaries can be changed. It should not be construed as  our recommendation . Our purpose is to show that boun­daries  can indeed be redefined and conflicts reduced.  Four subareas containing primarily standard acreage,  and two subareas with marginal and/or special timber man­agemen  t character were defmed within the original Bighorn­Weitas  area. The two marginal and/or special subareas con­tain  the majority of the scenic and water influence zones  and much of the high country.  The redefinition of area boundaries did not create a  clean separation of land classifications. Emphasis was placed  on achieving contiguity of all subareas with both high and  low timber resource character. Hence, subareas contained  some acreage in all of the land categories. Inclusion of pre­dominantly  standard acreage was the primary subarea  criterion for areas with high timber resource character.  Standard  Special  Marginal  Unregulated  Excluded From  Fig. 1.

A planimetered acreage measurement was used in  lieu of estimates from other sources to be consistent with  the subarea acreages. Next to the Sulphur (4066) and Mallard  Larkin (1300) roadless areas, the Bighorn·Weitas is the third  largest National Forest roadless area inventoried by the  USDA Forest Service in Idaho.  The acreage breakdown by land classification is given  in Table I. Standard acreage comprised 46 percent of the  total area followed by marginal (29%) and special (19%).  Figure I illustrates how these acres are geographically dis·  tributed within the area. Table I also gives the estimated  sawtimber board foot growing stock volumes by land  classification as reported in the Clearwater National Forest  inventory. Standard lands contain in excess of l.l billion  board feet followed by marginal (.72 billion), special (.31  billion), and unregulated (.017 billion).  Table 1.

Using a lab or coeffi·  cient of 16.17 per MBF (McKetta et al. 1978), this pro·  grammed annual harvest volume represents 588.6 jobs in  Nez Perce, Lewis, Idaho and Clearwater counties. If the total  area were designated wilderness, timber management would  be precluded, and the programmed harvest calculation base  eliminated. These jobs would then be lost within the multi·  county area.  Measured in timber values forgone, wilderness desig·  nation of the entire Bighorn·Weitas would amount to $2.98  million annually. This value is obtained by multiplying pro·  grammed annual harvest by $82.oo(MBF, the ~stimated  .,  '.~:"" . i;':i;. \.~';~ ,:. ,',~.~ ~~l;  average sawtimber stumpage price (net of development  costs) used by the USDA Forest Service for the Bighorn·  Wei tas area.  The Bighorn-Weitas subarea boundaries were rede­fined  to reduce the confiict with timber by delineating areas  containing contiguous blocks of acreages in the different  land classifications. Subareas containing largely standard  acreage might be considered for non·wilderness status, while  subareas containing predominantly special and marginal  acreages may be more appropriately considered wilderness.  Again, the criteria for delineation must be more complete  in actual application.  We redefined the Bighom-Weitas area as six subareas,  (1306·1 through 1306-6), all exceeding the 5,000 acre mini·  mum size (Fig. 2). Subareas I , 2, 4 and 6 contain predom·  inantly standard acreages and would have a higher timber  resource per acre tradeoff than subareas 3 and 5 which  contain substantial acreages in the special and marginal  categories.  Table 2 gives the acreage breakdown, the corre·  sponding apportioned growing stock, the programmed har·  vest by subareas, estimated jobs and resource values. The  subareas were then ranked by fewest jobs and resource  value impacts. Because of the subd ivision criteria, subareas  3 and 5 clearly have less impact on a per acre basis than the  other subareas.  Table 3 shows the cumulative changes in jobs and  resource values as all subareas are incrementally considered  for wilderness designation by the ranking given in Table 2.  Subarea 3 was ranked first, with lowest impact per acre,  resulting in an employment impact of 94.1 jobs and  $480,000 annually in resource value. [fboth subareas 3 and  5 should become wilderness, 159.9 jobs and $810,000  annually in resource value would be affected (Table 3). If  all subareas were designated wilderness the total impact  would amount to 588.6 jobs and $2.98 million annually  (Table 3).  SUMMARY  This study briefly documents the idea that present  roadless area boundaries need not be cast in stone. Much  can be done to reduce or resolve the economic roots of  allocation conflict bound to emerge from the wilderness  deSignation process. We have presented just one of the  numerous ways of subdividing areas to accomplish this  objective. We used criteria based on administratively  defmed land classifications. Results clearly indicate that  individual subarea evaluation, facilitated by redefming area  boundaries according to resource distribution, could sub·  stantially reduce the employment and resource value can·  fIlct.  ,,'  Table 2.

Part ridge and E.R. Canfield  ABSTRACT  Frequencies and volume-loss data derived from ten  years of forest in sect and disease survey work cover ten  important fore st-tree species native to the northern Rocky  Mountains. All important disease and insect causal agents  found during the surveys are listed . The amount of volume  lost from each tree species to each damaging agent is given.  Budworm, needle di seases, aphids and dwarf mistletoes  caused the most frequently found damage. However,  carpenter ants, heart rots, and root diseases caused the  grea tes t loss of volume . Spectacular or conspicuous agents  such as needle casts and in sects account for much less  volume loss than do the far less noticeable age nts such as  hea rt rots and root diseases.

This project has been supported by fund s from Mcin tire-Stennis  Research Project No. 23 and Forest Insect and Disease Manage­me  nt , Sta te and Priva te Fo restry , Int ermountain Reg ion, U.S.  Department o f Agr iculture - Forest Service.  The relative damage done by each agent remains ill-defined  even though inventories are an essential part of manage­ment  planning. Recognizing that it is impossible to assign  harvesting priorities correctly without estimates of real or  potential loss for an area, the University of Idaho assigned  forest entomologists and forest pathologists to initiate  surveys and studies of survey methods in 1968. Since then ,  tree data have been gathered each year throughout the  state. Additional finan cial aid from the U.S. Department of  Agriculture - Forest Service in 1978 permitted us to gather  sufficient information to report occurrences in the central  part of Idaho . All lands, regardless of ownership , were  included in our studies. The study area encompassed all  roaded portions of the Paye tte, Salmon, Boise , and Challis  National Forests and the Northern Division of the Sawtooth  National Forest along with included and adjacent lands  owned by other agencies and individuals.  METHODS  During the 10 years of study we compared several  systems of survey including studies from low-flying aircraft ,  random and nonrandom map spotting and modified random  se lections from stratified roadside locations. Repetition of  each system and comparisons of data indicated that aerial  surveys located the fewest problems and overlooked some  of the most damaging ones. Nonrandom selections heavily  favored spectacular problems while again overlooking major  damage . Modified random selections from maps or from  '&gt;103&lt;/ ISSN:00734594 ~ Universityof Idaho  --- --- - ---------------------------------  roadside provided essentially the same results as modified  random selections in nonroaded areas except in sparsely  wooded areas or exceptionall y steep or rocky terrain.  Therefore, the data reported here were ga thered from  randomly·loca ted sample trees not more than 800 meters  and not less than 40 meters from a road. Roads along which  trees were to be sampled were selected by aerial examination  of sample areas. We preferentially selected roads which  traversed cover types representing the sampled area. Roads  located on or near stream beds, non forested dese rt or  non forested alpine sites generally were eliminated or  used sparingly. However, we did not exclude recrea tional  areas, grazing lands with sparse tree populations or wa ter­sheds.  Judgment and expe rience rather th an strict adherence  to a statistical design were necessary parts of this survey  system . As we drove into each forested area, we selected a  number from a con tainer of tags numbered separately from  I to 10. These numbers then were considered selected  mileages at which we would stop to establish plots. This  procedure st ratified the presele cted road network in a  pract ical and unbiased manner. When each plot was finished ,  we aga in selected a number for the same road or on a  continuing side road. We emphasized unbiased selections  and rep resentative sampling rather than precision of location  throughout the selection processes. A toss of a coin at each  stop decided whether Ihe plot would be uphill or down­hill  , or to Ihe left or right of the road. We then chose a  series of five markers from a contain er with numbers 1-25.  The first of the 5 numbers was used to locate a plot center  from which stand measurements were made. A simple  count of trees beginning at least 40 meters from the road  edge or beyond obvious road disturbance was used to find  the plot-center tree, The other four chosen numbers were  used to select four sample trees , one upslope, one down·  slope, and two along slope in two directions. The four trees  were completely measured and described in their standing  conditions, then felied, measured , dissected and carefully  searched for any and all problems. Any tree, alive or dead,  having any remaining fo liage and a measurable diameter  at breast height (1.37 m) was el igible fo r selection as a  sample tree. The restriction of foliar presence prevented  sampling badly decayed, nonrecoverable specimens.  We compared the results of our roadside sampling  with resu lts of a similar sampling in nonroaded areas. These  tests were located at seven widely separated areas of the  Payette and Bo ise Nat ional forests (Table I), and each  included a similar readed and nonroaded area. In nonroaded  Table I.

When we arrived at the preselected mileages,  we moved at right angles to the t ra il , employing the se lection  process outlined previously and found four trees for examina·  tion. Data were recorded as for roadside selections.  During all parts of this survey we took unknown  insects, problems, fungi , stains, or decay to our laboratory  facilities for culturing, rearing, and iden tification.  After 10 years we have accumulated sufficient sample  trees to calculate the frequencies at which problems occur  and actual or potential volume losses for many problems.  Although gaps in information rega rding growth loss are  evident , we feel that our volume-loss calculations are the  best available data for the area of southern Idaho bounded  on the north by the Salmon River and on the south by the  Snake River. We will update and modify methods to enable  sophistication of our data as the project continues.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Although we recognize the interactions and asso­ciations  of fungi, insects, higher plants, and other agents in  causing mortality , growth Joss, or decay, we have included  only the more obvious ones in this report. This permits  simplifying this first presentation and comparing acti­vities  or prinicipal causal agents . The primary cause ascer·  tained by each involved scientist is reported as the destruc­tive  force. Our roadside sample included 545 trees of 10  species and our off-road comparison-sample included 136  trees of 10 species in eight locations. A list of the scien tific  and common names of causal organisms and associated  problems (Table 2) in the study area provides the names  used in our summaries. Common names have been employed  whenever practical, but scientific names and their synonyms  are included. The first scientific name listed is considered  the preferred modern name ; others are synonyms.  The distribution of tree species (Table 3) conforms to  expected frequencies for this area but includes insufficient  information about larch, whitebark pine , or poplars to  pennit drawing conclusions. We combined data covering  grand fir and its hyb rid in this area because of problem  similar ities and because few field foresters can identify  differen ces between these trees.  Data are presented in several forms (Tables 4 and 5)  to permit flexible comparisons and interpretations. All  volumes are given in cubic meters which can be roughly  converted to board feet by multiplying by 2001 Unus­able  or potentially unusable volume is reported as ""loss""  or ""potential loss."" Loss includes volumes that are now  I A cubic foot contains between 5 and 7 board feet of lumber  which we can convert to between 176.5719 and 247 .2007 board  feet per cubic meter. Our figure of 200 board feet is a rough average  of these estimates.  Table 3. Percentage of each tree species in the sampled forest  population of 545 trees.  Species  Abies grolldis (Dougl.)

Potential loss includes  both unusable wood and recoverable wood which is dead  or dying. This is the loss that will be realized unless recovery  occurs. Ordinarily it will be the same as real loss unless  extensive sa lvage is performed. We used the term ""recov·  erable"" in the broad sense to include all material that could  be utilized if it were accessible and marketable.  All species except Engelmann spruce and lodgepole  pine had potential loss values near 50 percen t of the standing  volume (Table 5). This startling figure is moderated by  figures for average recoverable volume . The latter imply  that the principal form of volume loss is that which exists  as dead or dying standing trees. The relatively high values  for average recoverable volume per tree also indicate  that this volume exists in large , often decadent, old  trees. Keep in mind that a matu re tree measuring 18 inches  (45.72 cm) diameter breast high (4.5 feet = 1.37 m) and 70  fee t (2 1.34 m) tall contains 1.16760 m3 of wood.  Trees with completely sound wood were relatively  small as indicated by the figures for sound tree volumes.  Throughout the samples ponderosa pine contained  the largest volumes of sound or recoverable wood ,indicating  that this large, dry-site species is rarely decadent in the  area surveyed. This is supported by the figures for average  volumetric damage in this species (Table 4).  The frequencies of problems encountered (Table 4)  do not correlate directly with the damage levels caused.  The most frequent problems in order were budworm  damage, needle diseases , spruce gall aphid, dwarf mistletoe,  and decay by Phellinus pini. The greatest volume loss was  caused by decays in general, followed by loss to carpenter  ants which were associated with decays and particularly  with decay by P. pini, followed by loss to root diseases.

This fact, obvious with carpenter  an ts and decays I often is overlooked when pine engravers  work in ponderosa pine. The beetle rilay build up and  attack healthy trees but more commonly attacks those with  root disease. Western spruce budworm also is responsible  for decay entry through dead tops which it creates.  Major causes of volume loss must be evaluated care­fully  because major loss does not equate with spectacular  damage. For example , while mountain pine beetles cause  localized, rapid, visible loss in lodgepole and ponderosa  pines of this area, many other agents, including various  root diseases, cause at least twice as much volume loss in an  innocuous way.  When we compared problems on nanroaded and  roaded areas (Tab le 6), few differences in the kinds or  amounts of problems were discernible , indicating that  our sampling procedure was adequate to describe conditions  in the areas studied. Objections to roadside survey under  such circumstances are invalid; however, we recognize  that our data permit no comparisons between intensively­managed  forests and extensively-managed forests.  A1so, summaries are limited in the following areas.  First, the data are not stratified by age or size classes, wltich  may drastically influence the impacts of certain problems.  The data (Table 5) imply that this is so for dead or dying  trees caused by problems like root diseases. Second, we  included only trees with a measurab le diameter breast  high, thus excluding seedling and some sapling problems.  Third , we have not developed adequate growth·loss measures  or estimates to include in loss estimates and are missing  impacts by several agents. Nonetheless, major problems are  well outlined by the data presented, and needs for manage­ment  are implied. It aJso is obvious that the interrelation  and interactions of fungi , insects, and predisposition must  become part of the data used to develop management  strategies.  LITERATURE CITED  u.s.

Ferguson and David L. Adams  INTRODUCTION  Advance regeneration of shade tolerant conifers  is commonly present under merchantable timber in  northern Idaho. OverstafY removal releases these trees to  conditions of increased sunlight, moisture, and nutrients. If  advance regeneration can adjust to the new environment  and grow well, it stocks the site for the next rotation.  ... Advance regeneration can sIlOrten the rotation and reduce  the need for site preparation and/or planting. However , if it  is not able to adjust or if adjustment takes too long, the  advance growth is occupying space better utilized by other  trees.

Site Conditions  I) Response of released trees is significantly lower  on the grand·fir/pachistima habitat type (Daubenmire and  Daubenmire 1968) than on western redcedar or western  hemlock/ pachistima habitat types.  2) Interaction of slope and aspect plays an imp or·  tan t role in response. Progressively steeper slopes on  northerly aspects help release, whereas increasing slopes on  soutllerly aspects have the opposite effect (Figure 2).  Southerly aspects are also associated with a higher prob·  ability that released trees will again become suppressed­this  time by shrubs or other conifer regeneration.  3) Shade received from scattered residual overstory  trees or other regeneration is beneficial to release, but  detrimental to growth after the tree has adjusted to its new  environment. Adjustment requires about 2 to 5 years.  Physiological Shock  Released trees have to make a tremendous"" adjustment  when their environment is changed by overstory remova1.  Time is needed to develop sun needles. Shade needles may  abscise prematurely due to sun scald or in an effort to  conserve transpirational losses. The tree must build up  crown and root volume to support normal growth.  The first opportunity to assess whether release  was successful is the second growing season following  overstory removal.

RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR RELEASING GRAND FIR  Cedar and hemlock habitat types are good for release  regardless of aspect. Grand fir habitat types are not  recommended for release unless the aspect is north·  erly, or some residual overstory trees are left for  shade, or the trees are not severely suppressed. Judge  the degree of suppression by comparing the last 5  years' height growth of suppressed trees with that of  grand fir trees growing freely on similar sites.  Severely suppressed trees or those on hot, dry sites  need special consideration prior to release. A two­stage  removal of the overstory is appropriate for these  trees. Wait 2 to 5 years between cuttings.  Avoid damaging the regeneration during logging  operations.  Release small, young trees. In general, tali, older trees  will not respond as well or as quickly as short, young  ones. Trees more than 30 years old should not be  released . This corresponds well with results of other  5.  6.  studies which indicate that 40 years of suppressed  growth can produce suitable entry courts for the  Indian paint fungus, Echinodontium tinctorium (Aho  1977).  Following overstory removal, regeneration may be  clumpy with planting needed between the clumps and  along skid trails. Also, thinning may be necessary  within the clumps. Wait 2 to five years after release to  thin or remove large residuals. Choose leave trees  according to height increment, looking especially at  height increment 2 or more years following release . If  possible, remove trees which have sustained logging  damage.  Follow the progress of the stand after release. Shrub  development may negate the effects of release and  again suppress trees , especially on southern exposures.  LITERATURE CITED  Aho, P .E. 1977.

Using the most recent forest inventory data available  for the commercial forest land within the state, timber  supply in units of net cubic foot volume per acre year  was projected from the present to the year 2045. Alter­native  timber supply estimates were developed and are  presented separately for northern and southern Idaho  by each of the following ownership groups: National  Forest. Other Public ', Forest Industries, Other Private. '  A forest stand table projection model was used to  develop the timber supplies presented in this study.

This paper is designed to give an overview of Idaho's  timber supply picture From 1975 to 2045. Timber supply  projections are explained and discussed. Individuals in­terested  in a detailed discussion of the methodology,  data bases and assumptions used in the Idaho timber  supply study are reFerred to College of Forest ry,  WildliFe and Ra nge Sciences Experiment Station  Bulletin No. 15.  TYPES OF TIMBER  SUPPLY PROJECTIONS  Factors strongly influencing the level of timber sup­ply  that can be expected From the commercial Forest  land in the state of Idaho are the number of acres in the  commercial Forest land base, the intensity with which  the timber resou rce is being utilized, and the growth and  mortality rates of the Forest stands.  Timber supply projections reported in this paper a re  developed For a commercial Forest land base of 14.7  million acres. It is assumed that the acreage will remain  at this level until 2045.  Timber supply projections reFlect two timber  reso urce utilization intensities:  I) 100 percent utilization intensi ty, and  2) 1975 util ization intensity.  Timber supply projections based on 100 percent utiliza­tion  intensity assume all commercial Forest land is  managed exclusively For timber production with com­plete  utilization of all trees 4 inches in diameter and  larger. Timber supply projections based on 1975 utiliza­tion  inten sity assume commercial Forest land manage­ment  at a 1975 level of emphasis on multiple-use, en­vironmental  and economic management objectives.  Timber supply projections reflect Four alternative  growth and mortality rates. Timber supply, the total  volume of annual removals, is equated to:  a) 1975 gross volume growth,'  b) 1975 net volume growth,'  c) a modified net volume growth computed with a  mortality rate twice the 1975 mortality rate, and  d) a modified net volume growth computed with a  growth rate 10 percent greater than the 1975  growth rate and a mortality rate 10 percent less  than the 1975 mortality rate.  ~Gross volume growth is defined as total volume growth before  deduct ions for losses due to morta lity.  ~Ne t volume growth is defined as total volume growth after deduc­tions  for losses due to mortality.  TIMBER SUPPLY PROJECTIONS  Timber supply projections For the state of Idaho are  illustrated in Figs. I through 10. Interesting and impor­tant  Factors portrayed in these graphs a re discussed in  the Following paragraphs.  Sustaining Current Level of Timber Supplies  The sol id dot in Figs. I through 8 indicates the 1975  level of timber removals For each ownership group. IF  the solid dot is at or below timber supply curve 2b. that  ownership group should be capable of sustai ning its  current level of timber removals through 2045. The  assumption in obtaining timber supply curve 2b is that  commercial forest land acreage, utilization inten sity,  and net volume growth rates remain at 1975 levels. As  indicated by the position of the solid dot with respect to  timber supp ly curve 2b, all ownership groups except For  Forest Indust ries in northern Idaho are capable of  sustaining their current level of timber removals. Forest  Indust ries in northern Id aho will have to reduce their  current level of timber removals beFore 2045. It sho uld  be noted. however, that by allowing timber removals to  exceed net growth during a short-term program, an  owner can increase the rate at which mature and over­matu  re stands are converted to you nger, more rapid  growing stands.  Two Factors could cause all ownership groups to  reduce their current level of timber removals. These are  a reduction in commercial Forest land acreage, and less  emphasis on timber production and/ or more restr ictive  environmental management conditions.  Effect of Utilization Intensity  In Figs. I through 8 a comparison of projected  timber supply curves Ib ( 100 percent utilization intensi­ty)  and 2b (1975 utilization intensity) indicate the  tradeoFFs in timber supply associated with esthetic,  watershed, other multiple-use, and environmental  management objectives. Management of commercial  Forest land exclusively For timber production is limited  by these objectives. Merchantability standards' are  aiso renected in the difference between these two curves,  but multiple-use and environmental management objec­tives  are the dominating Factors. The assumption in ob­taining  timber supply curves I band 2b is that commer­cial  Forest land acreage and net volume growth rates re­main  at 1975 levels.  Because of multiple-use, environmental and  economic management objectives, the timber supply  associated with curve I b is not a realistic goal on public­ly  owned commercial Forest land. It only becomes an at­tainable  goal on commercial Forest land where the  owner exclusively manages his land For timber produc­tion  .  'Merchantability standards include factors such as minimum  stump and top diameter criteria.  • !

Timber supply curve I b assumes each  .'~ forest stand in the commercial forest land base in Idaho  :, ::J is readily accessible. For numerous acres this is not the  case.  Effect of Increased Growth Rates  Increased net volume growth can be obtained  through forest management practices which simply con­trol  the density of forest stands. The increase in timber  supply that could be attained through regulation of  stand densities is shown by the differences between  timber supply curves 2d and 2b in Figs. I through 8. The  assumption in obtaining these curves is that commercial  forest land acreage and utilization intensity remain at  1975 levels. If increased timber harvest is desired, more  intensive forest management practices would need to be  employed. Such management practices could take the  form of genetically improved growing stock, fertiliza­tion  and regeneration of current non stocked acreages.  However, it should be recognized that increases in  growth rates may often be difficult to obtain when a  constant or increasing level of emphasis on multiple-use  and environmental management objectives is main­tained.  Increases in timber supply through improved  management, in most cases, are slight when compared  to gains that might be accomplished through the relaxa­tion  of multiple-use and environmental management  objectives. This is illustrated by the difference between  timber supply curves 2d and 2b as compared to the  difference between timber supply curves Ib and 2b.  Effect of Mortality  In Figs. I through 8, the comparison of timber sup­ply  curves la, Ib, and Ic indicates the sensitivity of the  timber supply projections to different mortality rate es­timates.  The assumption in obtaining these curves is that  commercial forest land acreage remains at 1975 levels  and is managed at a 100 percent utilization intensity.  Curve la renects timber supplies in the absence ofmor­tality.  Slight errors in the estimation of mortality can  substantially modify the timber supply projections. For  example, if actual mortality rates are in fact twice the  mortality rates obtained from current forest inventories,  timber supplies would be represented by curve Ic rather  than curve I b. It is important that this factor be  recognized since mortality rate estimates are most sub­ject  to error in current forest inventory procedures.  ,  It should also be noted that the difference between  1975 utilization intensity and 100 percent utilization in­tensity  would not be as great if current estimates of mor­tality  were half what they should be. This is illustrated  by the difference between timber supply curves I band  2b as compared to the difference between timber supply  curves I c and 2b.  Comparison of Timber Supplies by Ownership  Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate the domination of timber  supplies in the state of Idaho by the National Forest  ownership group. Over 50 percent of the projected  timber supply in northern Idaho and over 80 percent of  the projected timber supply in southern Idaho is produc­ed  by the National Forest ownership group. The  assumption in obtaining these timber supply curves is  that commercial forestland acreage, utilization intensity  and net volume growth rates remain at 1975 levels.  This domination is a direct result of the fact that in  northern Idaho over 55 percent and in southern Idaho  over 85 percent of commercial forest land acreage is in  the National Forest ownership group.  CONCLUSIONS  Using present forest management practices, com­mercial  forest land owners should be able to maintain  1975 levels of timber supply through 2045. If forest  management practices were implemented which would  regulate forest stand densities, projected timber supplies  would exceed 1975 levels.  The projected levels of timber supply can only be ex­pected  if the com mercial forest land base and emphasis  on social, economic and environmental management  objectives remain at their 1975 levels for the entire pro­jection  period. A reducti on in the commercial forest  land base would reduce projected levels of timber sup­ply.  M ore restrictive timber management practices  resulting from changes in the emph as is placed on social,  economic and environmental management objectives  would also reduce projected levels of timber supply.  Estimates of mortality are the component of growth  most subject to error using current forest inventory  proced ures. Since mortality directly innuences projected  timber supplies, it is important th at forest inventory  procedures be implemented which reduce the variability  of this estimate.  _ Projected Average Annual Timber Supplies - Southern Idaho  8  :; ! • .;  • ~ •  "" • •  ,£  ..:t;:  -£~  U  =!~  ~_------ Ib  I. .~ -~ u  Ib ""  '!  :::::::======= "" I, =- 2d  ~ ___ =-_--------'b .-z-- •  Fig. 5.

U1liman  ABSTRACT  Duplicate transparency images of ground targets on  photographs taken with two different cameras, the Itek  KA-80A Optical Bar Panoramic Camera and the Actron  HR-732 Large Format Camera, were examined to deter­mine  the ground resolution available. Both systems yielded  average resolutions in the neighborhood of 22-24 line pairs  per millimeter of fIim, allowing contrasting ground objects  about two feet wide to be distinguished at a nominal scale  of 1:30,000.  INTRODUCTION  The U-2 aircraft of the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration's Airborne Instrumentation Research  Project have flown numerous photographic missions in  recent years for the U.S. Forest Service's Nationwide For­estry  Applications Program. From the 65,000-fl. altitudes  at which the U-2 operates, two cameras in particular pro­duce  medium-scale ""resource"" photography: the Itek  KA-80A Optical Bar Panoramic Camera and the Actron  HR-732 Large Format Camera. Both have 24-inch focal  lengths, and therefore yield images in the I :30,000 scale  range ; both also produce photographs of unusual dimen­sions.  The HR-732 yields conventional ""frame"" photographs  which differ from standard aerial imagery only in being  twice as wide (9 by 18 inch. rather than 9 by 9 inch.).  The KA-80A produces a 120-degree panoramic photograph  50 inch. wide by 5 inch. long, which exhibits considerable  convergence and foreshortening across much of the fIeld  of view.  .:t. The authors are Research Associate, Research Professor and  These cameras have been employed in a number of  forestry-related studies in various parts of the country.  Klein et al. (1978) in California and Dillman et al. (1979)  in Houston undertook controlled comparisons of the effI­ciency  of the two cameras in detection of tree mortality .  However, little published information has been available  concerning the ground resolution obtainable on the products  with which resource managers must work- duplicates of  normal color and color infrared transparencies. When  flights were scheduled over northern Idaho in 1979, ground  targets of known size and standard arrangement were set  out in order to measure actual resolution.

S'~,N iIi1 'r:;'?~'  METHODS  Targets were designed after the standard U.S. military  pattern (U.S. Govt. Printing Office 1963), with perpen·  dicular sets of triple parallel bars (Figure I). The largest  target bars measured 3 ft. by 15ft., and the smallest  measured 6 inch. by 30 inch. Each target covered a resolu·  tion range from 16 tci 98 line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm),  at a nominal I :30,000 scale.  Seven identical, complete targets were set out along a  40-mile northwest·southwest line (Figure 2). Troy, Idaho ,  where north·south · and east-west U·2 flight lines were to  intersect, was at the midpoint of the line of targets. The  two outermost targets were intended to test resolving power  near the limits of the panoramic camera's scan; the next  pair toward the center would be photographed at moderate  scan angles. The three targets at and near the midpoint  would be viewed almost vertically on both fligh t lines by  the panoramic camera, and would appear on the large for·  mat photographs as well.  Figure 2. Seven target arrays were constructed, maintained  in the field for a week, and removed. Damage from weather  and domestic animals was repaired before each U·2 flight.  Labor costs were about $900; materials about S300.  The white paper targets were oriented in cardinal  directions, as were the planned flight lines. Target elements  were held down with stones; the ground surface- grass,  soil, or rock- provided the background. Location, elevation  and orientation were recorded as the targets were con­structed.  Reflected light from target and background was  measured with an Asahi Spotmeter. Approximate contrasts  ranged from 6: I against a disked summer-fallow field to  14: I against thick lawn grass.  The HR-732 photo mission was flown on 28 June  1979. One of the cameras aboard was loaded with Kodak  Aerial Color Film (Estar thin base) SO-242 and not fitted  with a filter. Another, aligned with the first and making  simultaneous exposures, carried Kodak High Definition  Aerochrome Infrared Film (Estar base) SO·I27 and a CC  .30B filter. The aircraft flew at an average altitudeof66,000  ft. above mean sea level. The KA-80A mission on 3 July  was flown at about 61 ,000 ft.; the panoramic camera carried  Kodak High Definition Aerochrome Infrared Film (Estar  thin base) SO·131 (like SO·I27 but with a thinner base)  and a CC .SOC filter.  ANALYSIS  First-generation duplicate transparencies of the  KA-80A and HR· 732 photographs were received a few  weeks after the flight. Targets were imaged 49 times on the  panoramic photos and 38 times on the large format photos.  Five interpreters viewed each target image rnonoscopically  on a Bausch & Lomb Zoom 70 microscope, and identified  all target elements in which they could distinguish three  separate bars at any level of magnification. Elements  aligned with the flight line were recorded separately from  those oriented across the flight line. When results were  collated for analysis, three interpreters had to agree before  a given target element was counted as ""resolved.""  Altitude of the aircraft for each flight line was deter­mined  from measurements of ground objects of known  size. In terpreters' results were then translated into line-pairs­per  ·millimeter (Ip/mm) terms at photo scales derived from  the flight altitudes and the mapped elevations of the  targets. This was a straightforward process with the large  format imagery ; on panoramic photos, however, the value  of a ""resolved"" target element in line pairs per millimeter  depended upon its location on the photograph and its  orientation with respect to the flight line. If an interpreter  could resolve 36·inch·wide target bars lying across the  flight path at a nadir scale of I :30,000, he was observing  an image resolution of 16.4 Ip/mm. If the same element  were oriented parallel to the aircraft track (so that the  operation of distinguishing the separate bars would be  performed in the cross-track direction), and lay at the  extreme 60·degree scan angle, an observer who distin·  guished the same bars would be reporting a 65.6 Ip/mm  image resolu tion.  RESULTS  Itek KA-80A Optical Bar Panoramic Camera  On the SO-131 color infrared (CIR) film, average  reported resolution was 24 line pairs per milHmeter, with a  standard deviation of ± 5 Ip/mm. (This resolution would  enable an interpreter to distinguish 2-ft.-wide objects of  similar contrast at a nominal I :30,000 nadir scale.) Highest  resolution value reported by at least three interpreters was  35lp/mm.  There was no appreciable loss of image resolution  (in line-pair terms) with distance from the flight line. This  is characteristic of panoramic cameras (Amer. Soc. Photo·  gramme try 1975 :283).  There was no significan t correlation of resolu tion  with ground-measured target contrast differences ranging  from 6: I to 14:1. These contrast ratios are approximate,  because targets of standardized reflectance could not be  used. Ground contrast ratios greater than 10: I are seldom  encountered on high altitude photography (HeUer 1970).  Targets to the south of the east-west flight line aver­aged  5 Ip/mm better resolution than targets to the north.  This is probably attributable to differential lighting. The  resolution difference was significant at the .05 level. In  general there was no difference between resolution averages  from east-west and from north-south flight lines.  Measured average resolution tallies well with system  resolution predicted from published component capabili­ties,  using the conventional approximation in which the  reciprocal of system resolution equals the sum of the reci­procals  of the components' resolving power:  Contrast Lens SO· 13 I 2447 Predicted  CIR film Duplicating system  mm resolution  1000:1 1/250 1/160 1/100 = 1/49  1.6: I 1/160 1/50 1/50 = 1/22  HR-732 large Format Camera  Average reported resolution with normal-color  (SO-242) mm was 22 Ip/mm, with a standard deviation of  ± 2 Ip/mm. Highest value reported by at least three inter­preters  was 24 Ip/mm.  Average resolution with color infrared film (SO-127,  equivalent to SO-13I) was 21 Ip/mm, with a standard  deviation of ± 2 Ip/mm. Highest value was 23 Ip/mm.  Paired comparison indicates that the difference be­tween  normal-color and CIR resolutions, though very slight,  is significant at the .05 level. Published resolving power of  SO-242 mm at low (1.6 :1) object contrast is 100 Ip/mm;  for SO-I27 it is 50 Ip/mm, which probably accounts for  the difference.  There was no appreciable correlation of resolution  with distance from the central point (principal point) of  the photograph, or with ground-measured contrast on  either film.  Paired comparison of targets appearing on both  panoramic and large-format CIR photography showed a  small advantage in resolution for the panoramic system  (24 Ip/mm) over the large-format system (21 Ip/mm),  significant at the .05 level. A similar comparison of CIR  panoramic Imagery with normal-color,large-format imagery  showed no significant difference. Comparisons are likely  to be confounded by the 5,OOO-ft. difference in altitudes  at which the two missions were flown.  LITERATURE CITED  American Society of Photogrammetry. 1975. R.G. Reeves, Ed.

Mahoney, James A. Moore, and Joseph J. Ulliman  A silvicultural prescription displays comprehensive  information and a plan of activities related to natural re·  sources production in a forest stand. Recent improvements  in site classification techniques and data analysis have made  forest measurement data much more useful, particularly  for projecting tree growth and stand response to silvicul­tural  practices. New data analyses and display techniques  may simplify choosing among alternative forest manage­ment  regimes; however, the data output depends entirely  on the format, sequence, completeness and accuracy of  the information provided by those who make silvicultural  prescriptions.  Most forest stands could be managed under several  silvicultural alternatives within the biotic potential and  constraints of the site and current stand.

An itemized stand and site evaluation form for silvi·  cultural prescriptions is provided and explained . The form,  designed for use by foresters and forest technicians in the  northern Rocky Mountains, could be used in other forest  regions with modifications for local conditions. Although  the infonnation level is well suited for field evaluations by  certified silviculturists, anyone with knowledge of forest  inventory techniques and local soil, vegetation, and protec·  tion needs should be able to complete the form adequately.  No specialized equipment or measurements are required,  and most items are evaluated on the basis of visual obser~  vation.  The evaluation should show which sites and stands  require additional examination by a specialist in road  engineering, vegetation or soils management, grazing, fire,  or insect and disease protection . The field evaluation can  be completed prior to, during, or following the stand  inventory, but should be a permanent and updated part  of stand records prior to any management activity.  This form is not intended to reduce writing a silvi~  cultural prescription to a series of mechanical steps, but  ~ Universityotldaho  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO LIBRARY J  L  rather it is designed to ensure that many prescription in ­fluencing  factors are considered during the first stand  examination. ~n addition, we feel that the information pro­vided  by the evaluation form should help refresh the  memory of a silviculturist who may write or review a pre­scription  at some future time after the field examination,  and would serve as a record for review by an incoming  silviculturist.  Itemized Explanation of Stand and Site Evalu­tion  for Silvicultural Prescriptions  I. Name of actual field observer(s).  2. Date of evaluation.  3. File or map number for the stand and other identity.  4. Legal description of stand location ,including meridian  (e.g., NW 1&lt;1, SE 1&lt;1, Sec 10 T41N R3W BM).  s. Stand size (identify if hectares or acres).  6. Check No if not cruised for inventory. If  cruised, record observers, date cruised, fixed and/or  variable plot size and break point, and the number  of sample plots. Check status of data processing.  7. Record elevation to nearest 100 feet.  8. Record average percent slope inclination to the  nearest 5 percent.  9. Record average stand aspect and note range of  aspects .  10. Check topographic position relative to local  topography.  11. Check the localized landform in terms of stand  contour.  12. Check the appropriate main access conditoh. Main  access refers to roads suitable for heavy-haul traffic,  A pn'mary haul road is a two or more lane, all­weather,  heavy-duty road with a paved or graveled  surface that is normally free of drainage and surface  problems or other factors that may limit access. A  secondary haul road may have one or two lanes with  a graveled surface, is capable of supporting heavy­duty  traffic on a seasonal basis, and may be limited  by poor drainage or other weather related factors.  If a stand does not have direct main access, estimate  and record the distance to main access along a route  suitable for road construction. Check whether  existing or proposed main access is above and/ or  below the stand.  13. Check the appropriate sub-access condition . Sub­access  refers to within-stand access required for  management and harvest activities, Excellent sub­access  includes proper design , location, and main­tenance  of existing stand roads, skid trails, and  landings, which are permanently established and  intended for reuse. Adequate sub-access means that  these fealUres are of less than excellent quality  and may cause some damage to the site and stand,  but are retained and reused to avoid losing additional  stand growing space to construction of a new road/  landing system.  Redesign of sub-access is required when increasing  loss of site and water quality and integrity will resu lt  from reuse of all or part of the existing system, or  where the design and location of existing stand  roads , skid trails, and landings are not adequate for  future management and harvest activities.  14. a.  b.  c.

Name the habitat type(s) or other ecological classifi­cation  and list authority.  16. Estimate the percent cover class for shrubs, forbs, and  grasses independently. For shrubs, indicate the  height class(es) under the appropriate cover class (i.e.,  low shrubs &lt; knee height , mid shrubs- knee height to  shoulder height; tall shrubs&gt; shoulder height). List  the shrub species that are dominant in terms of cover.  Total percent cover may exceed 100 percent.  17. Check the appropriate soil conditions using a soil  probe or auger, or clean a profile of a roadcut or gully  to estimate soil material and depth characteristics.  Visual observation and general knowledge of the  potential response of local soils to disturbance are  required to estimate the various soil characteristics.  18. Check the air drainage conditions for the stand area,  using topography as the main criteria.  19. Record the event of past fires, including year(s), and  cite evidence such as charred boles or stumps, char­coal  in the litter or soil proftie, etc.  10 CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS Fl.OOI  20. Record fuel size classes as large, medium, or small for  each fuel load class. Heavy fuel loads comprise a  continuous cover of all fuel sizes over most of the  stand. Moderate fuel loads either lack continuity or a  full range of fuel sizes. Light fuel loads contain  only patchy residues of large and medium fuels.  Large fuels are those greater than 4 inches in diam­eter.  Medium fuels include branches and other  woody material 14 inches in diameter. Fine fuels  include duff, litter, grasses and other non woody  fuels, and twigs and branches up to 1 inch in diam­eter.  21. Check the level of past grazing. Severe grazing  includes a majority of the stand having soil displace·  ment and compaction, erosion of heavily used trails,  bare areas, trees browsed, and shrub browsing past  the current year's growth. Heavy grazing includes a  patchy distribution of otherwise severe grazing  characteristics, or less deteriorating soil and  vegetation conditions. Moderate grazing includes  sites where the grazing resource is fully utilized with  little apparent degradation of the site. Light grazing  occurs in stands infrequently grazed for a short time  with little impact on soils or vegetation. Check the  animal(s) grazing or record the common name of  other domestic or wild animals.  22. Check the number of stories in the current stand, and  the percent cover of tree size classes (e.g., unstocked =  20%, pole = 30%, sawtimber = 50%. May exceed 100%,  especially in mixed species stands).  23. Record the cutting history, including commercial and  precommercial entries.  24. Check the site preparation for the current stand.  25. Record the planting history.  26. Indicate the condition codes of all tree species in the  current stand by size class. Indicate P after the  code to show potential conditions. Indicate the  extent of the existing condition by placing H (heavy  = &gt; 50%), M (medium = 25·50%), or L (light = &lt;  25%) after the code. Indicate the seed source paten·  tial after code 24.  27. Estimate and check the amount of time that can  elapse prior to implementing the prescription. This  will mainly depend on the changes in the stand and  site which would require a change in prescription.  For example, incipient insect outbreak, rapid loss  of vigor due to competition, or loss of stand volume  to disease may require that the prescription be  implemented as soon as possible (ASAP). A stand  that would not benefit from a thinning, but will  be more economically valuable given 20 years  additional growth, may be delayed for a harvest/  regeneration prescription.  28. List any additional stand and site evaluation by a  speCialist and state why such an evaluation is needed.  29. Describe the stand structure and proposed pre·  scription in general terms as indicated .  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  Preliminary versions of the evaluation forms were  tested for a number of forest stands by the following  foresters:  Russell Graham, USDA Forest Service, Inter·  mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station,  Moscow.  James Hertel, USDA Forest Service, Palouse  District, Clearwater National Forest.  Donald Larson, USDA Soil Conservation  Service, Moscow.

He is most likely to have a professional occupation and a  family income slightly over $21,000 a year. He drives a  half ton truck an average of 50 miles one way each trip to  cut almost 6 cords of wood on a summer or fall Saturday.  Although many forest managers view firewoqd collecting  activities as a form of recreation, the collector says that the  primary reason he is collecting is to save money. According  to the firewood collecting and wood heating behaviors  examined in this 1981 mail survey, the actual monetary  savings may be quite small in many cases.  OBJECTIVES  Firewood collecting is rapidly increasing on our  national forests (N.F.)' yet little is known about this  historically important and recently renewed use of our  forest resources. The three objectives of this study are: 1)  The author is Assistant Professor, College of Forestry, Wildlife and  Range Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho 83843.  r  tJ J?

This report,  largely descriptive, is primarily for the survey respondents,  and, therefore, mainly addresses objectives one and two. A  complete statistical analysis will be published at a later  date.  METHODS  According to USDA Forest Service supervisor's  offices, 80,902 personal use firewood permits were given  out during 1980 in Idaho. In April 1981, a randomly  selected sample of 1096 individuals from this population  was sent questionnaires. The sample was stratified by forest  to assure statewide representation. In most casesJ one  ranger district from each of the forests was randomly  selected. At least 2.5 percent of the permit holders on the  ranger districts which were sampled was selected by using a  random start and selecting every yth name. In order to have  at least 40 names per subpopulation, larger percentages  were taken on several districts.  Of the 1096 questionnaires which were mailed, 53  were not delivered, leaving 1043 eligible respondents.  Responses were received from 858 (82%) people. Six  (0.6%) reported that although they had gotten a permit,  ~ UniversityOfldaho  they had never collected any firewood; 22 others were  returned blan k, were returned too late, or were not able  to be coded. The results reported here are based on 830  (80%) usable questionnaires. Response rates by districts  ranged from 70 percent to 89 percent.  Dillman's (1978) Total Design Method (TDM) was  followed to develop the questionnaire and to carry out the  survey. This method is based on social exchange theory and  careful administration of the survey instrument. Two ver·  sions of the questionnaire were developed to expand the  information available without unduly taxing an individual  respondent. Thirty-nine questions were on every question­naire;  31 additional questions were on the version A ques­tionnaire,  and 28 additional ones were on version B.  Response rates for the two versions were 79 _6 percent and  80.7 percent, respectively ..  The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package  for the Social Sciences (SPSS) developed by Nie et al.  (1975) and updated by Hull and Nie (1981).  Although the response rate was very high, 28 of the  185 nonrespondents were randomly selected and reached  by telephone. Ten questions were asked, and the results  were compared with the responses of those who mailed  back the questionnaire. Three (11 %) did not receive the  questionnaire, three others could not complete it, and 5  (18%) received it but did not cut any wood on a national  forest. For those nonrespondents who did cut wood, there  was no statistically significant difference (,,; .05) between  them and respondents on the following variables measured:  1  -Coeur d'Alene  _ Orofino  2  _Challis  3 4  -Boise  5  T~ln Falls  Figure 1.

The nonrespondents were  younger than respondents and a higher proportion were in  forest-related occupations. Thus, the demographic charac­teristics  of nonrespondents may be slightly different, but  it appears that the wood use and collecting behavior of  nonrespondents is accurately reflected by respondents.  In the analysis, some variables were examined  according to the geographic area of the state in which the  respondent lived. The areas are delineated in Figure 1.  Areas 1 and 2 include forests in Region 1 of the Forest  Service. The others are in the Forest Service's Region 4 .  RESULTS  Demographic Characteristics of Firewood  Collectors  At the time of this writing the 1980 Census of the  Population is not available. The preliminary Census reports  state that the population of Idaho has increased over 32  percent in the last decade (U.S. Dept. Commerce 1980).  Because of this sizeable increase, it is of little use to make  comparisons between firewood collectors of 1980 and the  general population of Idaho in 1970. The Bonneville Power  Administration and the Pacific Northwest Utilities Con­ference  Committee (1980) conducted the Pacific Northwest  Residential Energy (PNRE) Survey between October 1979,  and February 1980. Idaho firewood collectors will be  compared to Idaho respondents in the residential energy  survey on several variables, as this statewide survey of  residential electric utilities' customers should be fairly  representative of the general population of adult Idahoans.  The average age of firewood collectors in Idaho is  44.2 years with a range of 16-88 years. The age distri­bution  is fairly even between 25 and 45 years with slightly  over half of the respondents in this bracket. There is a  slight drop, but still a fairly even distribution between 45  and 70 years (about 40%). The PNRE Survey reported a  slightly larger percentage of respondents in the over 65  age group. In general, it appears that firewood collectors  are fairly representative of the statewide adult population,  except for asomewhat smaller proportion of senior citizens.  The most frequent category for 1980 household  income of firewood collectors was $25,000-49,999 (24.5%),  although the arithmetic mean of the grouped data was  $21,198. Since the PN RE Survey reported 1978 household  income, there are not sufficient data available at this time  to say whether firewood collectors have an annual house·  hold income different from that of the general population.  Occupational categories of firewood collectors are pre­sented  in Table 1 .  Forty-nine percent of the respondents have some  education beyond high school. The average number of  years of education is 13.2 years. A higher proportion of  Table 1. Occupational categories of firewood collectors.

The PNRE Survey reported 27 percent of the Idaho  respondents living in rural areas (population 2500 or  less). Among firewood collectors, 16 percent live on a  ranch or farm, 19 percent in a town less than 1000 popu­lation,  and 23 percent in an urban area of 1000 to 5000  population. This difference in rural VS. urban residence is  not surprising, given the equipment and expertise necessary  to collect firewood, the storage space needed, and prox­imity  to forested areas.  The vast majority of questionnaires (93%) were  completed by men. Although the questionnaire was ad­dressed  to the person who obtained the permit from the  Forest Service, it is assumed that when it arrived,. the  household member who was primarily responsible for  firewood collecting filled out the questionnaire. No ques­tions  were asked about the involvement of other household  members in the firewood collecting activities.  Idaho firewood collectors are generally not new  residents of the state. Twenty-eight percent have lived here  all their lives. Both the mean and the median (the 50th  percentile) are 30 years of residence. Twenty-three percent  of the respondents have lived in Idaho less than 10 years.  The PNRE Survey reported 76 percent of the Idaho  respondents lived in single family dwellings, 13 percent in  mobile homes, and the remainder in multi-family dwellings.  The percentages for firewood cutters were 81, 12, and 6,  3  respectively. As might be expected, more firewood col­lectors  own their homes (90%) than PNRE Survey respon­dents  (77%).  Collecting Behaviors and Preferences  Firewood collectors are willing to invest a considerable  amount of time and money to obtain firewood available on  national forests. In addition to purchasing wood-burning  equipment, 85 percent of the respondents reported pur­chasing  their chain saw primarily for firewood cutting.  Two-fifths have a saw with a 16- or 18-inch bar and over  one-fifth have a saw with a 20- or 22-inch bar. It is likely  that over half of the firewood collectors invest at least  $250 in the purchase of a chain saw. The respondents were  equally split between repairing their own saws and taking  them to repair shops for maintenance.  Three-fourths of the respondents state that they spend  one-half day or less cutting a cord of wood and another  half day splitting and stacking the cord. Only 18 percent  of the respondents are willing to wal k more than 300  feet from their vehicle to collect firewood. At the same  time, firewood decks or slash piles, which would be most  likely to be near the road, are the least preferred form of  firewood. Seventy-five percent of the respondents most  prefer standing dead for their firewood, and 21 percent  chose it as their second most preferred. The first and  second preferences for dead and down were 20 percent and  68 percent, respectively. Two possible explanations are:  collectors enjoy felling trees; or they believe the wood has a  higher quality and is cleaner if they remove it from the  woods themselves. These preferences need to be considered  or investigated more thoroughly if forest managers are con­sidering  yarding firewood to the road and/or encouraging  firewood collectors to restrict themselves to slash piles.  The preferred species of wood for residential heat  varies with the forest where the respondent collects fire­wood  and often reflects the most common species of  wood available. Those who collect on the Boise N.F. listed  Douglas-fir as the most preferred species. Western larch  (tamarack) is the most preferred species on the Idaho  Panhandle, Nezperce, Clearwater, and Payette national  forests. The permit holders on the 5 other Idaho national  forests listed lodgepole pine as the most preferred.  Considering that the reason to collect firewood having  the highest relative importance is to save money, today's  cost of gasoline, and the average miles per gallon for most  trucks, one of the most surprising results of this survey is  the distances driven to obtain firewood. Statewide the  arithmetic mean' for the average number of miles driven,  one way, to collect firewood is 50.5 miles. The median  IThis is the sum of all responses divided by the number of  responses.  (50th percentile) is 44.6 miles. One-fourth of the respon·  dents drive 70 miles or more, one way, on the average and  also stated that the farthest they have driven is 90 miles or  more, one way. The arithmetic means for responses to the  questions, IIWhat is the farthest you have driven, one way J to  collect firewood?"" and IIHow far are you willing to drive,  one way, to collect firewood?"" are almost equal: 68.5  miles and 67.5 miles. The medians are both 60 miles. Thus,  the obvious conclusion is that on the average people are  willing to drive as far as they have ever had to drive at  this time.  The distances driven vary considerably among regions  of the state. Those in northern Idaho (Areas 1 and 2) and in  Area 4 drive less than 30 miles one way to obtain their  wood, whereas those in the rest of the state drive consid­erably  farther. The average one-way driving distance is  statistically significantly different (&lt;&gt; ; .10) between respon­dents  who use wood as a main heat source (47.7 miles) and  those who use it as a secondary source (53.5 miles). The  average miles driven and the miles willing to drive for the  various groups are shown in Table 2.  Nearly half of the respondents collect their wood in  a half-ton truck and one third use a three-quarter-ton truck.  One-ton and two-ton trucks are used by 7 and 8 percent,  respectively. Thirty-six percent of the respondents use 4-  wheel drive vehicles. Thirty-six percent also use a trailer.  Although the range in the size of the trailer varies from a  500-pound capacity to over 10,000 pounds, 60 percent  of the trailers have a capacity of one ton or less. Owners of  three-quarter-ton trucks are more likely to use a trailer  than are owners of other vehicles.  The average number of trips necessary to collect  enough firewood for a heating season is 6. Thus, the average  Table 2. Average one-way miles driven to collect wood and miles  willing to drive one way to collect wood by area and heat source.

Using an average cost of operating a truck (including  depreciation, maintenance, and fuel) of 30¢ per mile,  the typical wood collector spends approximately $180.00  to transport his wood from the forest to his home.  Motivation  The widespread use of wood heat in Idaho homes is a  recent phenomenon. In 1970, only 2.7 percent of the homes  in the Pacific Northwest were heated with wood (U.S.  Dept. Energy 1980). The PNRE Survey (1980) reports  that 45 percent of the Idaho respondents used wood as  their main or secondary source of heating fuel in 1980. This  recent change in the role of wood heat is also reflected in  the results of this firewood survey. Over three-fourths of  the respondents started using wood as a heat source in the  last five years, and over 50 percent purchased their present  wood-burning equipment in 1979 or 1980. Both the  number of people who began using wood as a heat source  and the number purchasing their present wood-burning  equipment were greatest in 1979 and declined slightly in  1980.  There is much speculation by forest managers and  others about the motivating factors underlying the recent  large increased use of firewood. The most frequent hypo­thesis  is that people are collecting firewood primarily as a  form of family recreation and because it is convenient in  Idaho. Many forest managers do not see it as an economical  activity for most citizens. These beliefs are not supported  by survey respondents.  The survey participants were asked to rate nine  reasons for using wood to heat their homes and nine reasons  for collecting their own firewood on a 6-point scale ranging  from extremely important to not important. The relative  importance of these reasons are exhibited in Figure 2.  Fifty-five percent of the respondents say that it is  extremely important to save money in both cases: using  wood heat and collecting their own firewood. Twenty-seven  percent say it is very important. liTo reduce my use of  utility company fuels"" is rated extremely important by  50 percent of the respondents. Since utility company rates  have been steadily increasing in recent years, the desire to  reduce the use of such fuels may be related to economic  reasons. However, the desire to be energy self-sufficient  may also be part of the high rating given this reason. The  fact that self-sufficiency is rated second highest as a reason  to collect their own firewood supports this interpretation.  More discussion on the economics of firewood coliecting  will be presented later in this paper.  Enjoyment of wood collecting as recreation has the  lowest relative rating -as a reason to use wood heat,  according to survey respondents. However, 50 percent ofthe  respondents say the enjoyment of wood heat in their homes  is very important or extremely important. Also, lito be in  the woods/' ""to be with my family,"" and ""to get some  exercise"" are all moderately important reasons to collect  firewood and are recreation·related motivations.  The motivations for using wood heat were also  analyzed for persons stating that wood is their primary  source of heat versus a secondary source and according to  various areas of the state. The relative importance of the  reasons changed very little when respondents were broken  into these different groups. The top two reasons and the  bottom one did not change for any group. The only dif·  ference between those using wood as a main heating source  and those using it as a secondary source is that the relative  importance of enjoying the use of wood heat is lower for  those using wood as a main heating source.  Reasons people decide to use wood heat  The enjoyment of wood heat is also relatively less  important to citizens in southeastern Idaho (Areas 6 and 7).  It is more important to citizens in Areas 3 and 5 lito take  advantage of firewood on public lands."" The citizens in  Areas 4 and 7 rate the reason ""to help reduce America's  consumption of oil and gas"" as more important than  respondents in other regions. The opportunity to use a  convenient Idaho fuel source is relatively less important  to Idahoans living in Area 4 than to other Idahoans.  Respondents were also asked to list other reasons that  were important to them besides those mentioned on the  questionnaire. Ten percent of the respondents did so. The  reasons most frequently given were lito keep warm,"" lito  use an alternative energy source"" and ""to clean up the  forest.

The  arithmetic mean for the number of cords burned is 4.7, and  5.9 cords are cut. The medians are 4.0 and 5.0 cords,  respectively (see Table 3). This 1+ cord difference between  burning and cutting is consistent for most subgroups  examined. The cords burned and cut were calculated for  the various areas and for the two types of heat source. In  general, given the climatic conditions, the differences  among areas are as expected: respondents in Areas 1 and 6  burn the most wood, and those living in Areas 3, 5, and 7  burn the least. Overall, the best estimate of the total  number of cords of firewood cut on national forests in  Idaho in 1980 is 480,000 cords.  Although the dimensions of a cord were given on the  questionnaire, some respondents may have overestimated  the number of cords cut. An examination was done on the  number of cords cut divided by the number of trips for  each respondent and grouped according to size of vehicle  used. The results are reported in Table 4.  Respondents were also asked about purchasing any  of their firewood. Twenty percent reported doing so at  some time during the past 3 years. The most frequent  number of cords purchased was 1, and the median was 1 .9  cords. The most frequent kind of wood purchased was  pine, and the average price per cord ranged from $47 in  1980 to $42 in 1978. Twenty-five percent of those pur­chasing  wood in 1980 paid $60 or more. Nearly half (43%)  of the respondents reported that the most important  reason they might purchase wood in the future is a udecline  in personal health."" Other frequently given reasons (in  order) were: less wood available in the forests; higher  prices for oil, gas, or electricity; and having to drive further  to firewood areas.  Table 3.

The wood-burning equipment used by respondents  is presented in Table 5. A wood stove is much more  common if wood is the main source of heat. However, a  surprising number of such homes use a fireplace, and  7 percent have only a fireplace_ Among those who consider  wood heat a secondary source, 39 percent have only a  fireplace. Slightly more Idaho residents use wood stoves  than reported by Dalton et al. (1977) in astudy of fuel wood  use in New Hampshire (62% vs 57%).  Table 5.

Table 5 also shows the alternate sources of heat  available in respondents' homes. More firewood collectors  have electricity available and fewer have natural gas than  reported in the PN RE Survey (40% and 28%, respectively).  Sixty percent of respondents' fireplaces have glass  doors, and 57 percent have a heat exchanger. The PN RE  Survey reported 44 percent and 28 percent respectively.  Three-fourths of the stoves are considered airtight by the  respondent. Only 18 percent of the respondents are con­sidering  an equipment change before the next heating  season. Another stove is being considered by over half of  this group of respondents and glass doors and/or a heat  exchanger by nearly one-third.  A larger percentage of those using wood as a main  source of heat live on a ranch or farm or in a village of less  an 1000 population (40% vs. 30% for secondary users)  and are in forest-related professions (8% vs. 3%). Those  using it as a main heat source are also slightly younger  (42.7 yrs. vs. 45.2 yrs.) and have a lower average income  ($19,500 vs. $23,000).  Information Needs  There are many opportunities to learn more about  the use of firewood for home heating. The USDA Forest  Service and other forest managers often provide such infor­mation,  both in forest offices and through other communi­cation  channels. The Cooperative Extension Service is also  a good source for such information (see Appendix).  Over 60 percent of the survey respondents stated that  they would like to have more information on cleaning  their chimneys, energy conservation in their home, and  where they should cut firewood. Information on the kind  of firewood to cut and firewood species identification is  needed by nearly half of the respondents. Thirty-eight to  forty-four percent of the respondents would like infor­mation  on felling trees, chain saw safety, use, maintenance  and repair, installing a wood stove or fireplace insert and  types of wood burning equipment. Half of the respondents  would most prefer to receive firewood information via  brochures and one-fourth prefer the newspaper.  Fees  Statewide, 57 percent of the respondents are willing  to pay a permit fee to cut firewood. Fifty-two percent  prefer that the fee be charged per cord, and 48 percent  prefer it be a one-time charge. Only 30 percent of those  responding are willing to pay a fee to be used to yard wood  to the roadside or for road oiling and maintenance. There is  considerable variation in these responses when analyzed by  area of the state and by forest district where the permit  was obtained. There were also a number of comments, both  pro and can, written on the questionnaires about fees. A  more complete analysis of the fee questions and other forest  management-related issues is being prepared for another  publication.  7  Safety Factors  One out of six respondents reported having had a  chimney fire . The chimney cleaning behaviors of this group  are not obviously different from those who did not have a  fire: 38 percent of all respondents state that they clean  the chimney lias needed""; one-fourth do so once a season;  17 percent have never cleaned the chimney; and the other  respondents do so every month or every other month.  When the data were analyzed according to those who had  had a fire and those who had not, none of the above  responses changed by more than one percent. In both cases,  14 percent of the respondents hire a chimney sweep and  pay an average of $40 for this service. The respondents who  clean their own chimney spend about one hour on this task  and their investment in chimney cleaning equipment aver­ages  $36. A more in-depth investigation of the occurrence  of chimney fires is necessary to establish or refute any rela­tionship  between fire occurrence and type of equipment  used or species of wood burned or other variables.  Chain saw use was the other safety related topic  investigated. Although only 3 percent of the respondents  have been injured seriously enough to require a doctor's  care and none required hospitalization, few use the standard  protective equipment available to loggers. Two-thirds of  the respondents never wear hard hats or ear plugs, 93  percent never wear leg chaps, and 42 percent never wear  safety glasses. Most respondents wear long-sleeved shirts and  gloves. However, this is often for warmth rather than safety.  Vandalism  Several private and public forest managers are con­cerned  that increased vandalism and other forest damage is  occurring as a result of firewood gathering. Survey partici­pants  were asked to indicate how often they had observed  or seen evidence of a number of improper activities when  they had been collecting firewood.  Twenty percent of the respondents reported seeing  other firewood collectors frequently driving off roadways  and leaving high stumps. Over half of the respondents  reported observing the following activities from once to  occasionally: cutting live trees, driving on very wet roads,  and leaving a mess on the road. Improper felling of trees,  such that equipment, roads or culverts were damaged, was  never observed by 73 percent of the respondents. From 82  to 92 percent of the respondents stated they had never seen  evidence of other firewood collectors driving past or  removing road barricades (82%). taking logs from logging  operation log decks (87%), or using logging equipment  which was left in the woods (92%).  Although these data can provide a benchmark of  citizens' reported observations of such activities in 1980,  additional research and analyses of both private and public  forest records are required to determine if known damage  and real dollar losses have been adversely affected by in­creased  firewood collecting in Idaho's forests.  UNiVtliSif'i OF WAHiJ LIBRARY  CONCLUSION  Although an examination of the economics of fire·  wood collecting was not a specific objective of this study,  the results of the study raise many economics·related  questions. The most important reason survey respondents  gave for their engaging in firewood activities was the desire  to save money. Slightly over half of the respondents believe  they are saving $300 or more a year on their heating  bill by burning wood. However, if we use the figures and  assumptions suggested by Hanley (1981) and the average  round trip miles driven by respondents, the average cost of  collecting and burning a cord of wood is $59.90 ($11.67/  cord for purchasing and self·maintenance of the wood·  burning unit; $7.83/cord for chain saw costs; and $40.40/  cord to drive a half ton truck 101 miles, round trip). Since  the average collector cuts 5.9 cords, his estimated cost of  collecting is $353.41 per year. More research and analysis  is needed, including obtaining utility rates, before the  break-even values of the wood and the maximum allowable  transportation cost can be determined.  Firewood availability and its management on the  nati onal forests of Idaho is a serious concern of many  Idahoans. This is evidenced not only by the results of and  interest in this study, but also by the presence of firewood  as one of the current forest planning issues on many of the  forests. It is hoped that this study will serve as a useful  reference both now and in the future for understanding  firewood use in Idaho in 1980.

INTRODUCTION  An annotated list of the parasites, predators and  other associates of mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroc­tonus  ponderosae Hopkins, in lodgepole pine (LPP), Pinus  contorta var. lalifolia Engelm., and western white pine,  Pinus monticola Douglas, was published by DeLeon (1934).  The list provided information on feedi ng habits, seasonal  occurrence and abundance of many species. Quanti tative  data on abundance of many species were lacking, and little  in formation on emergence periods and within-tree distri­bution  was provided. This paper presents additional infor­mation  on relative abundance, within-tree distribution and  emergence periods of insect species associated with MPB·  infested LLP in central Idaho and northeastern Oregon.  Feeding habits for each species, as reported in the literature  (Bush ing 1965, Dah lsten and Stephen 1974), also are pre·  sented.  ~ Universityotldaho  r  METHODS AND PROCEDURES  Sampling was conducted in seven LPP stands located  in the Payette National Forest in Idaho and in the Wallowa­Whitman  National Forest in Oregon (Tab le 1). The stands  were se lected because each contained a declining infest;ltion  of MPB, where higher populations of associated entomo­phagous  insect species were expected (Bi llings 1970).  Most stands were sampled several times during the  3-year study to assure representation of differing genera­tions  and developmental periods of MPB in a variety of  geographic areas. However, some stands were sampled in  on ly one year. For example, Paddy Flat stands 14 were  sampled in October 1977, and again in both Ju ly and Octo­ber  of 1978 and 1979; the McCubbin stand was sampled  in September and November of 1979; and the Sled Springs  and McCall stands each were sampled in May 1978.  At each sampli ng date, two currently infested (b rood)  trees in each of four, 5-cm diameter (breast height) classes  (17, 22,27 and 32 cm) were fe lled at 40-m intervals in each  of the seven stands. An equal number of emergent trees  (from which the beetles had re ce ntl y emerged) in each of  the four DBH classes also were selected in the McCubbin  stand in November 1979 to determine whether the inci­dence  of various insect species differed between brood and  emergent trees for a given time and stand .  Slab samples (15 x 30 cm) were removed at 2-m inter­vals  along the north-facing aspect of each fe lled tree in all  stands. Three additional slabs from the 0 .8, 1.3 and 1.8-m  (upper dimensions) leve ls were removed from the lower  bole along the same aspect to increase sampling in tensity.  Slabs from all but the McCall stand in 1978 were stored at  10°C for subsequent examination, at which time the num­ber,  stage and feeding site of each insect species present  were recorded to determine relative abundance and withi n­tree  distribution. The slabs obtained in 1978 from the  McCall stand were enclosed with nylon screen cages in early  June. These were exam ined at weekly intervals until  December 1978 to determine the emergence periods of  each species present at the time of cagin g, and to obtain  specimens for identification.

The six scolytid  species were present in substantially greater numbers than  all other insect associates, with Pityopthorus confertus  Swaine the most abundant species. The within-tree distri­bution  for each bark beetle species was fairly constant  among trees. However, the abundance of anyone species  var ied among trees even within the same stand. No attempt  was made to determine the causes for this variation, but  previous studies have shown that such factors as climatic  conditions (Safranyik and Jahren 1970), food quant ity and  quality (Berryman 1976), inter· and intra-specific competi·  tion (Cole 1962, 1973 a, b, 1974, 1975) and tree resistance  (Berryman 1976) may affect bark beetle host preferences,  survival and abundance. These scolytids normally feed on  injured, dying and recently dead trees, but when such  material is no longer available, they may attack and ki ll  some residual trees (Chamberlin 1935, Furniss and Carol in  1977, Reid 1955, Sartwell et al. 1971) .  Fourteen predaceous and 3 parasitoid insect species  were collected, in addition to 4 species considered facu lta­tive  predators by De l eon (1934) . The number of indio  vidual predators usually was greater than parasitoids. The  most commonly collected entomophagous insect species  were: Medetera aldrichii (Wheeler). Lonchaea sp. , Coeloides  rufovariegatus (Provencher), Rhopalicus pulchripennis  (Crawford ). Enoclerus sphegeus (Fabricius) and Thanasimus  undatulus (Say) (Table 2). These and other entomopha·  gous species often occurred th roughou t the MPB·infested  portions of trees . However, predators were concentrated in  the lower to mid-bole, while parasitoids were found more  frequently in the upper bole. These distribution patterns  may be related in part to varying bark thicknesses along the  tree bole. For example, Rhopalicus pulchripennis (Craw·  ford), a hymenopterous parasitoid of MPB, prefers to ovi­posit  in smooth rather than rough bark in sugar pine, Pinus  lambertiana Douglas (Ball and Dah lsten 1973). However,  many other factors, such as host density and moisture  content of the inner bark surface (Billings 1970), also may  have influenced within-tree distribution patterns of these  species.  The adult emergence period for many of the entomo­phagous  species lasted several weeks (Table 2), with several  '.  beginning before and ending during MPB emergence. In the  McCubbin stand, many of the entomophagous insect  species were present in samples removed from both brood  and emergent trees. This suggests that such species emerging  before MPB emergence may oviposit in brood trees at­tacked  the previous year, while individuals of a species  emerging during MPB emergence may oviposit either in  recently-attacked trees or in trees attacked the previous  year. Several entomophagous species (e.g., Enoc/erus  sphegeus F.) were capable of completi ng development in  MPB vacated (emergent) trees, emerging the following year,  and ovipositing in trees recently or currently under attack  by MPB.  These preli minary observations of within - and be­tween-  tree distributions of the various entomophagous  insects, and the suggestion that emergent trees provide a  breeding habi tat for those species, ind icated that emergent  trees should be left in the stand for at least one year follow·  ing MPB emergence. This practice, with the concurrent  removal of brood trees during harvest (salvage) or control  cuttings, would conserve a proportion of the entomopha­gous  insect population, and reduce MPB populations.  Testin g the above hypothesis and the efficacy of a phero·  mone-based control tactic served as objectives for subse­quent  studies in the same stands.

Hanley, Said Messat  INTRODUCfION  Small private woodlands throughout the Pacific North­west  frequently do not attain maximum wood fiber produc­tion  because they receive little or no stand management. In  many cases the attainment of sawlog-sized trees is seriously  reduced by the overcrowding of individual stems. Thinning  is a simple method that land managers employ to alleviate  overcrowding, thereby reallocating the available growing space  to selected crop trees. Crop trees from thinned stands will  grow more rapidly than comparable trees from unthinned  stands, thus producing more usable, high-value wood products  for the landowner.  The authors are, respectively, Professor and Associate Extension  Professor of Forest Resources; Extension Forester, Washington State  Unil'ersity; and former graduate student, Department of Forest  Resources.  Published as Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station  Contribution No. 521.  A 1976 paper in this series reported on the excellent  growth responses obtained by thinning twenty-year-old pon­derosa  pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) plantations in the  Palouse Range of northern Idaho (Hanley and Adams, 1976).  This paper updates the progress of the same plantations, in­cluding  the results of a second thinning undertaken at approx­imately  age 35 years.  STUDY METHODS  I l\~ ISSN :0073-4594  Ponderosa pine plantations were established on the  University of Idaho Experimental Forest from 1941 to 1943.  Between 1958 and 1964, twelve study plots were installed  averaging .25 acres in size. All twelve plots were thinned from  below at time of establishment, removing the smallest, least  vigorous trees. Six of these plots were subject to a second  ""low"" thinning in 1976. Three unthinned control plots were  established in 1975, and tree ring measurements were used  to recreate tree diameters at the time adjacent plots were  thinned. Control plots were used to compare unmanaged  growth with results in thinned stands .  . l40 ~ Universityof Idaho  The first thinning reduced the average tree density by  28 percent. Numbers oftrees per acre after the first thinning  ranged from 147, with an average spacing of 17 ft x 17 ft ,  to 355, with an average spacing of II ft by II ft . The second  thinning removed an additional 20 percent of the trees. Tree  density per acre after the second thinning ranged from a mini­mum  of 130, with an average 18-ft x 18-ft spacing, to a maxi­mum  of 318, with an average 12-ft x l2-ft spacing.  STUDY RESULTS  The responses reported in this paper are based on di ­ameter  breast high (dbh) and total height measurements tak­en  in 1&lt;JI7 and in 1987, providing average annual growth values  for 10 growing seasons. Table I shows bas ic information for  the thinned and unthinned plots. Average yearly growth data  are presented in Table 2 . Table 2 and Figure I show that di­ameter  increment on once-thinned plots (0.22 inch/yr) was  120 percent greater than on the unthinned plots (.10 inch/yr).  Average annual diameter growth on twice-thinned plots was  .27 inch/year, a 170 percent increase over unthinned plots and  a 23 percent increase over once-thinned plots. Stated anoth­er  way, the number of years required fo r a selected crop tree  to grow an additional inch in diameter was 10.0 years in the  unthinned stands, 4.6 years in the once-thinned pl ots, and only  3.7 years in the twice-thinned plots (Table 3).  Dramatic differences were also exhibited in cubic-foot­volume  growth per tree (Table 2 and Figure I). One thinning  increased individual tree growth by 188 percent; two thin­nings  increased tree growth by 227 percent. For a tree to pro­duce  one cubic foot of wood volume required about 3 years  on unthinned plots, I year on once-thinned plots, and less  than one year on twice-thinned plots (Table 3).  However, total per-acre annual fiber production was  decreased by the thinnings during this IO-year period. As com­pared  with the unthinned control plots, one thinning decreased  net per-acre volume growth by 50 percent; two thinnings by  54 percent.  Table 1.

Additionally, thinning overcrowded pine plantations  results in a more vigorous plantation which is usually less  vulnerable to insect and disease problems.  LITERATURE CITED  Hanley, D.P. , and D.L.

L. Williams  D. R.Cox  L  Station Paper No. 1  December, 1966  SUMMARY  This study was initiated to explore the feasibility of in­creasing  employment and income in northern Idaho through  the development of the cut-up lumber industry. In the first  phase of the study, questionnaires were sent to firms in sel­ected  industrial categories to determine the wood products  they utilized; t he desired characteristics, important species,  and volumes used of cup-up lumber; and the potential for in­creasing  its use.  The firms which responded to the questionnaire indicated  that 35 percent of them used cut-up lumber. In total they re­ported  using 1,800 million board feet of cut-up lumber an­nually.  While hardwoods were most frequently rated as the most  important species of cut-up lumber, western pines were rated  as the second most important species group.  Resistance to splitting was the characteristic of cut-up  lumber most desired with machineability, dimensional stabil­ity,  glueabi lity, paintability, and durability following in order  of decreasing desirability.  There is an interest in increasing the use of cut-up lumber.  Over 20 percent of the responding firms indicated they were  interested in the future use of cut-up lumber or in expanding  their present use.  The strongest interest in the expanded use of cut-up lum­ber  was indicated in the Western, North Central, and Middle  Atlantic regions.  ' "" ' ; ~~ -.. -';~ \  4 , ' .. .. ~ f-.  (2)  , ..

The forest products industry, based on an  abundant forest resource, is now Idaho's second largest industry.  The industry provides jobs for over 12,000 people and a payroll of  over sixty million dollars.' Although this resource has provided  the base for industrial growth, many forest areas show signs of  hosting udepressed economies,"";.!  This study is the first of a series exploring the feasibility of in­creasing  employment and incomes in northern Idaho through the  development of cut-up lumber"" operations. The development of  these cut-up lumber plants would reduce the seasonal fluctuation  in employment common in logging communities.  The decision to explore the feasibility of using cut-up lumber  plants as a means for improving income and employment was  made for several reasons. First, Idaho has an abundant supply of  western white and ponderosa pines, some 38.5 billion board feet.  These species are rated as premium material by many cut-up  lumber users because of such desirable characteristics as their fine  texture, machineability, and paintability. Second, the transporta­tion  costs of cut-up lumber are reduced relative to standard size  lumber because most of the waste is eliminated at the mill and  maximum utility is delivered to the customer. With Idaho distant  from most of its markets, cut-up lumber would allow the producer  to extend his market area while operating under the same trans­portation  costs. Third, small plants are often involved in cut-up  lumber operations as they are frequently more efficient than large  plants for this type of production. Such small cut-up lumber plants  require a relatively low capital outlay to construct and maintain  and are particularly well adapted to the sparsely populated areas  that occur in northern Idaho.  In this phase of the study, the objectives were to delimit:  1. The wood product inputs used in designated product cate­gories.  2. The volume of cut-up lumber used.  3. The use of western wooel species as cut-up lumber, compared  to other species.  4. The characteristics desired in cut-up lumber.  5. Conveyance in which received.  6. Potential for future use of cut-up lumber j ' :he selected  product categories.  lAnonymous. 1965. Covered Workers in the Lumber Industry (Report),  Idaho Department of Employment.  :!""Priming the Pump of Regional Growth,"" Business Week, Oct. 9, 1965. p. 96  :ICut-up lumber stock is lumber that has been pre-cut to specific customer  specifications (not standard size lumber).  (5 )  METHOD AND SCOPE  The selection of the initial sample population was based on the  present use of industrial standard-size lumber, the quality of the  lumber material used, and .the type of product produced. The origi­nal  sample population was selected using the Standard Industrial  Classification (SIC) categories listed by the U.S. Forest Service  publication ""Wood Used in Manufacturing Industries. '"" An SIC  category was selected only if it consumed .04 percent of the total  national volume of industrial lumber. A few others were chosen  because of the type product they produced or because they were  considered to use a high quality lumber material.  The SIC categories selected were as follows: 2431, millwork  plants; 2433, prefabricated wooden buildings and structural mem­bers;  2441, nailed and lock corner wooden boxes and shook; 2442,  wirebound boxes and creates; 2443, veneer and plywood containers,  except boxes and creates; 2445, cooperge; 2449 wood products,  not elsewhere classified (n.e.c.); 2511, wood household furniture,  except upholstered; 2512, wood household furniture, upholstered;  2515, mattresses and bedsprings; 2521, wood office furniture; 2531,  public building and related furniture; 2541, wood partitions, shelv­ing,  lockers, and office and store fixtures; 2591, venetian blinds  and shades; 2599, furniture and fixtures, n. e.c. ; 3421; cutlery;  3423, hand and edge tools, except machine tools and hand saws;  3741 ,locomotives and parts; 3742, railroad and street cars; 3751,  motorcycles, bicycles and parts; 3791, trailer coaches; 3799, trans­portation  equipment, n.e.c.; 3931, musical instruments and parts;  3941, games and toys, except dolls and children's vehicles; 3942,  dolls; 3943, children's vehicles, except bicycles; 3949, sporting and  at hletic goods, n. e.c. ; 3951, pens, pen points, fountain pens, mech­anical  pencils and parts; 3952, lead pencils, crayons, and artist s'  materials; 3981, brooms and brushes ; 3988, mor t icians' goods;  3993, signs and advertising displays.""  The fi rms in the above SIC categories used 7,840.8 million board  feet or 67 pe rcent of the total 11,742.9 million board feet of in­dustrial  lumber used in 1958. These industries consist of 40,107  firms, or 13 percent of all manufacturing firms according to the  1963 Census of Manufacturing.'  Of these 40,107 firms, those having a net worth of over $50,000  were selected for the mailing sample. This net worth quantification  reduced the sample to 16,422 firms. The decision to sample only  the f irms with a net wor th of over $50,000 was made because the  larger firms consume the great majority of lumber.  Questionnaires' were sent to 16,422 firms throughout the United  States. The recipients were asked to reveal the type of products  4U.S. Forest Service. 1965. Wood used in manufacturing industries.

If  the respondents indicated they used cut-up lumber, they were asked  to disclose the volume used, conveyance in which it was received,  the species class of cut-up lumber used, and the characteristics  they desired. The respondents were also asked to indicate if they  would consider using cut-up lumber in the future.  QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSE  There were 16,422 questionnaires mailed and 3,870 or 23.6 per­cent  were returned and analyzed. This is well above the expected  return for national surveys.  Response by Region  The Intermountain Region showed the highest rate of response,  with 31 percent out of those contacted (Fig. 1). The West North  Central region followed with a 27.1 percent response. The Pacific  Coast region returned 26.1 percent of the questionnaires, and the  East North Centr al region returned 24.8 percent.

The reSponse from the North Central regions might be attributed  to familiarity with and interest in Idaho lumber products as Idaho  markets almost half of its lumber in the North Central regions.S ""  14  8~  8  MILLWORK  WOOD BOXES  WOOD FURNITURE (UPHOLSTERED)  WOOD FURNITURE (UNUPHOLSTERED)  MATTRESSES B BEDSPRINGS  OFFICE B INST.

(8)  Response by Product Manufactured  There was a well-balanced response from manufacturers of  every type product in the questionnaire. The response by the type  of product produced varied widely, with millwork being the domi­nant  product. Figure 2 shows the products produced by the re­spondents.  Of the 3,870 respondents, 807 or 21 percent indicated they pro­duce  millwork. There was little difference in the remaining per­centage  spread, with morticians' suppliers constituting 2 percent  of the respondents, and metal fabricators constituting 14 percent  of the respondents. Several categories with fewer total firms, such  as morticIans' supplies and tools, showed a low total response.  USE OF WOOD PRODUCTS  Standard size lumber and plywood were the two types of wood  product inputs most used by the responding firms (Fig. 3). Over  50 percent of the respondents used standard size lumber and 43 per­cent  used plywood. Standard size lumber was particularly import­ant  to the millwork, woodbox, furniture, and transportation equip­ment  producers with over 70 percent of the firms in each of these  categories using standard size lumber. Plywood was reported to  be used by over 70 percent of the millwork, unupholstered wood  furniture, office equipment, transportation equipment, and adver­tising  sign producers.  50  r.:-:  35  r.:':':  STANDARD CUT-UP  SIZE  LUMBER  43  ~  27 27  r.-:-:"" r.-:7  22  ~ .t:.~  PLYWOOD HARDBOARD PARTICLE NONE  8  fLAKE BOARD  Figure 3.

Some of the larger groups in this category were  wood pallets, prefabricated homes, trusses and laminates, and specially wood items.  The responding firms revealed that cut-up lumber was their  third most important type of wood product used. About 35 per­cent  indicated that they used cut-up lumber. Such material was  used extensively in every SIC prod uct category except for the  machinery and metal product groups (Table 1). Firms producing  mattresses a nd bedsprings, toys, and tools showed cut-up lumber  to be their most frequently used wood product. More than 45 per­cent  of the respondents producing millwork, woodboxes, wood fur­niture,  and transportation equipment used cut-up lumber.  The use of hardboard and par ticle and flakeboard was not as  wide spread as the other three wood products used by t he firms  studied. However, 50 percent of the responding firms producing  millwork; office and institutional furniture; unupholstered furni­ture;  partitions, shades, and fixtures; and advertising sign cate­gories  used hardboard or particle board products.  VOLUME OF CUT-UP LUMBER USED  The cut-up lumber consumers are characterized by a la rge num­ber  of firms using small volumes and a few f irms using large  volumes of cut-up lumber (Fig. 4).

( 11)  ing firms which used cut-up lumber reported that they consumed  in total over 1,800 million board feet annually. About 1.2 percent  of this volume was consumed by 67 percent of the cut-up lumber  using firms at a rate of less than 200 thousand board feet per firm  annually. The remaining 98.8 percent of the volume was used by  the remaining 33 percent of the f irms using over 200 thousand  board feet. The 3 percent of firms using 10-30 million board feet  of cut-up lumber per year consumed 65 percent of the total volume  reported.  Although the use is skewed toward the large firms and the  sample skewed toward the smaller firms, when desired character­istics  of cut-up stock were compared, they were found to be similar.  USE OF CUT-UP LUMBER SPECIES  Species Used by Product Produced  Table 2 shows selected cut-up lumber species used by firms in  the indicated product categories. The respondents were asked to  rank up to three species in order of importance to their firms. The  figures appearing in Table 2 were the sums of the weighted rank­ings.  Table 2.

First ranked  species were weighted with three; second ranked with two; and third ranked  with one.  (12)  The respondents showed that hardwood and western pine cut-up  lumber were the two main species groups used. They were followed  by fir-larch and southern pine. Hardwood cut-up lumber was the  predominant species used (by frequency) in 12 out of 14 product  categories, and western pine was first in the other two. Western  pine was ranked as first or second in all but two categories. West­ern  pine cut-up lumber was revealed to be the most important  species in the millwork and morticians' supply categories. It was  second in all others except for the machinery, transportation equip­ment,  and metal fabric groups.  The firms manufacturing machinery, transportation equipment,  and metal fabrics showed hardwoods as their most important  species followed by either fir-larch or southern pines. These species  were generally regarded as stronger and tougher, thus fulfill ing  the needs for trailer bodies, frames, truck beds, and crating.  The other western cut-u p' lumber species listed in the question­naire  were shown to have lIttle importance in the majority of the  product classifications.! Hemlock, alder, and cedar-redwood species  were used only in small quantities. Cedar-redwood, however, was  the third most important cut-up lumber species in the morticians'  su pply category.  Species Used by Regional Location  The species ranked ""first in importance"" by each respondent  was closely related with the species class of lumber manufactured  in the respondent's geographical area (Table 3). This was to be  expected, as an industry will naturally utilize the least expensive,  and thus usually local, material available.  Those respondents in the Southern and Middle Atlantic reg­ions,  in particular, appear to have developed industries that use a  preponderance of hardwood cut-up material. Hardwoods were im­portant  as a ""first-ranked"" cut-up lumber species class in every  region, but heaviest use was in the East North Central, East South  Central, Middle Atlantic, and Southern Atlantic regions.  Western pines were shown to be most important ""first-ranked""  species in the Pacific Coast, West North Central, Intermountain,  and New England regions. They were the most important ""second­ranked  ""species in five of the other nine regions. The West South  Central, and Middle Atlantic regions were the only regions with  less than 30 percent of the respondents showing western pines to  be the most frequently ""second-ranked"" cut-up lumber species. The  respondents in the West South Central and East South Central  regions indicated that southern pine was their most important sec­ond-  ranked species.  These facts point out that cut-up lumber will only be shipped  long distances to consumers when it is needed to fill some special  requriements. The respondents have located their businesses in  proximity to the major species used by their firms, but when a need  for ""secondary species"" arises that the geographical region does  not provide, they ship long distances for the needed products.

Those producers using fir-larch and hemlock had  resistance to splitting ranked second. M achineability and dimen­sional  stability were also very important desired characteristics in  most species. The respondents showed that the lack of odor and  color were not important characteristics for most of the species  listed.  Table 4 shows the relationsh ips between the characteristics of  cut-up lumber the r espondents desired and the species of lumber  they were using. This table indicates whether the respondent was  actually using cut-up lumber species that possess the characteristics  he desired or merely ""substituting"" other species because of cost or  availability limitations. For example. a white-pine cut-up lumber  user who showed that his most desirable characteristics were tough­ness  and dark color was obviously not receiving the product he de­sired.  A comparison between the characteristics desired by western  pine and hardwood users is shown in Figure 5. This figure shows  a similarity between the characteristics desired.  Those respondents r anking western pines as the most important  species listed resistance to splitting as the most desirable characte r­istic.  followed in order of decreasing desirability by machineability.  dimensional stability. glueability. paintability. and durability.  67  r.;::: 61  '::. ~  65 = "". 57 .:-:-: r----  ' ifi  "". ·~l  55  51-  .,.""  ::: I!'l  WESTERN PINE CONSUMERS  HAROWOOD CONSUMERS  46  ':':':'  :-"":-:''13-4'-  "" f  ':-::t  . :.\  57 -  RESISTAf'.4CE MAC~'NEABILITY DIMENSIONAL GLUEABIUTY PAINTABILITY STRENGTH  TO STABILITY  SPLITTING  Figure 5.

These were the  only variations between the two in the six most desired character­istics.  There was also a similarity between the characteristics desired  by f ire-larch and southern pine cut-up lumber users (Figure 6).  Fir-larch consumers ranked strength as the most important char­acteristic,  followed by resistance to splitting. Southern pine users  listed res istance to splitting as the most important characteristic  followed by strength. This was the only variation between these  two species classes in the ranking of their five most desired char­acteristics.  56  64  TO  SPLITTING  r:::::::::::::: FIR-LARCH CONSUMERS  [=:J SOUTHERN PINE CONSUMERS  48  DIMENSIONAL  STABI LITY  DURABILITY SCREW HOLDING  ABILITY  Figure 6.

Characteristics Desired, According to Product Produced  Table 5 shows the relationships between the product produced  categories and t he characteristics t he f irms though t were impor t­ant.  Although the characteristics desired varied widely in the dif­ferent  categories, the respondents indicate that machineability, re­sistance  to spli tting, strength, and dimensional stability were the  most desired characteristics.  Machineability was shown to be first in importa nce to those  manufactUl'ers producing millwork ; unupholstered furn iture ; of­fice  and institutional furniture; a nd part itions, shades, and fix­t  ures . Resistance to splitting was shown to be second in importance  to the same manufactu rers.  (17)  Resistance to splitting was shown to be the most important  characteristic to those firms manufacturing wood boxes, uphol­stered  f urni ture, mattresses and bedsprings, toys, morticians' sup­plies,  machinery, and others.  Strength was the first or second characteristic desi red by those  firms manufacturing transportation equipment, machinery, steel  products, wood boxes, upholstered fu rniture, and mattresses and  bedspr ings.  Characteristics Desired, By Volume of Cut~up Lumber Used  Table 6 shows diffe rences that exist between the characteristics  desired by small cut-up lumber consumers and large cut-up lumber  consumer s. This table shows there was little variation between the  characteristics desired by small consumerS and large consumers.  Resistance to s plitting was the most impor tant characteristic in  every volume size class. It was generally fo llowed by machineabil­ity,  strength, and dimensional stability.  The la rgest size class, or those using 10 to 30 million board feet  of cut-up lumber annually, placed more importance on dimensional  stability and durability than smaller users.  Table 6.

Over 40 percent of the respondents in  the West North Central, East North Central, West South Central,  and the Middle Atlantic regions indicated making carload pur­chases.  Over 40 percent of the respondents in all nine regions in­dicated  making truckload purchases. It is important to remember  that these percentages represent the method of purchases only, and  not necessarily the volume purchased.  In every region except the West North Central, more cut-up  lumber purchases were made by truckload than by carload. The  higher percentage of truckload purchases may indicate the import­ance  of central distributing or wholesale centers that distribute the  orders by truckload.  c= TRUCKLOAD  G:ZZ:J  66  CARLOAD  ~ = 57 56 r:::: c::::: 49 49 49 ...  ... ~. 43 ::::::: ~ 45 = ...  42 43 ::: ,.;.; ~ i' ~ .. ::: 35 ~ ~ ~  ... ... .. &lt;::::= . .. ... ... , ...

In t he smallest size class, less than 30 percent of the respondents  made ca rload purchases, whereas over 50 percent of the respond­ents  made t ruckload purchases.

As was shown by t he respondents, these f irms also  do some supplemental buying in truckload orders.  POTENTIAL USE OF CUT-UP LUMBER  Although t here was wide f luctuation in the respondents' an­swers  to t he question, ""If not already doing so, would your com­pany  consider using cut-up lumber mater ial in ex isti ng products?""  ( 20 )  a good deal of inte rest was shown in the use of cut-up lumber. In  total, some 406 or lOA percent of the 3,870 total respondents indi­cated  they were interested in the future use of cut-up lumber,  though they were not now using it. An additional 446 firms or 12  percent of the respondents who were already using cut-up lumber  voluntarily revealed they would like to use more cut-up material.  Potential Use, By Type of Product Produced  Wood box producers showed t he greatest interest in expanded  use of cut-up lumber as 46 percent indicated they would consider  newly using it (Figure 9).

Machinery, metal stampings and speciality metal products pro­ducers  showed little interest in cut-up lumber. Less than 12 per­cent  of the respondents in these categories indicated interest in its  future use. These manufacturers were included in the study be­cause  they use large quantities of standard size lumber. They use  lumber in packaging and crating, but t hey indicated it was more  practical to purchase standard size lumber material and cut it to  size themselves.  Potential Use, By Region  The responding firms indicated that there is more interest in  increased use of cut-up lumber in the West Coast, the North Cen­tral,  and Middle Atlantic states than the other regions (Figure 10).  Fourteen percent of the firms interested in the future use of cut-up  lumber were located in the Pacific Region, 38 percent were in the  two North Central regions, and 16 percent were in the Middle At­lantic  region.  14 r.:-:  C""o  7  r.::::  27  :-;--:-:'  7  t';':'.  ,.1,.,6..  : :  ,'. 9  "",::,  : :  :  PAcmc INTER WEST WEST EAST !AST NEW 11110 SOUTH  MOUNTAIN NORTH SOUTH NORTH SOUTH ENGLAND ATL.ANTIC ATL. ...

Schenk, Robert H. Giles, Jr., and Frederic D. Johnson'  Within the past decade there has been increased interest in  research on the biology and control of cone-infesting insects, and  recognition of the need for additional information concerning the  influence of insecticides on the treated trees, seed germinat ion, and  seedling development. Insufficient data on the effects of insecti­cides  on other animal life continues to create concern and contro­versy.  Insects attacking conifers have been successfully controlled by  means of trunk application of systemic insecticides; however, many  failures also have been reported. Watchtendorf (16) applied oxy­demetonmethyl-  impregnated bands to the trunks of spruce, but  failed to control certain species of Ips and Pit yo genes bark beetles.  Using similar methods with demeton, Vite' (13) also was unsuc­cessful  in preventing either the formation of galls by two adelgid  species, or in killing the nymphs within the galls. On the other  hand, Kinghorn (7) obtained systemic control of the mountain  pine beetle, Dend1""octonus ponde1""osae Hopk. (= monticolae Hopk.) ,  in lodgepole pine using bands impregnated with demeton and  schraden, but did not achieve control of the Douglas-fir beetle,  Dend?'octonus 1)seudotsugae Hopk., in Douglas-fir. Vite' (13) did  obtain good control of the adelgid, D?'eyfusia musslini C.B., on pine  with the use of oxydemetonmethyl-impregnated bands. Vite' (12)  also found that both demeton and oxydemetonmethyl-impregnated  bands gave acceptable systemic control of a thrips species and  young larvae of the casebearer, ColephoTa la.?·icella Hbn., on larch.  Oxydemetonmethyl apparently was more rapidly translocated than  demeton.  Vite' (14) reported that efficient control of the thrips species  and the casebearer also was obtained by trunk injection of oxy­demetonmethyl,  but that similar use of demeton resulted in some  phytotoxicity. Giese, et al. (5) tested five systemic insecticides,  including demeton, against a midge by trunk injection into balsam  fir. This insecticide provided the most rapid and complete kill of  the midge larvae at the lowest dosage (1 gm active per tree) ;  however, phytotoxicity was serious enough to preclude usage of  IPublished with the approval of the Director, Forest, Wildlife and Range  Experiment Station, University of Idaho, Moscow.

(3 )  even this low dosage in balsam fir. Of special interest was the find­ing  that tree diameter was positively correlated with the time re­quired  for complete kill of the midge larvae for any given concen­tration  of insecticide.  Pitkin and Portman"" tested eight systemic insecticides in pole­sized  Douglas-fir during 1963. Varying dosages of each insecticide  (actual toxicant per diameter inch) were injected in holes drilled  near the base of each tree. Only dimethoate at 13.9 gms and oxy­demetonmethyl  at 3.7 gms per diameter inch showed promise. No  symptoms of phytotoxicity were found.  Johnson and Rediske (6) developed and used an isotope tech­nique  in testing systemic insecticides for the control of cone and  seed insects. Of the eight tested, only dimethoate, schraden, and  demeton gave good control of the seed chalcid, Megastigmus spel'­moth1'  Ophus Wachtl., and both dimethoate and demeton produced  some symptoms of phytotoxicity, even at the lowest dosages. Pub­lished  accounts of studies of phytotoxic reaction in seeds or seed­lings  were not found.  Translocation of inorganic salts in conifers was traced by  Moreland (9), Fraser and Mawson (4), and Ferrell, et al. (2),  among others. Translocation of organic compounds, such as growth  hormones and some phytotoxins, in trees was reported by Ferri  (3), and Beckman and Kuntz (1). Vite' and Rudinsky (15) have  investigated the importance of water conducting systems in coni­fers  to the distribution of trunk-injected chemicals. Wedding (17)  has explored the plant physiological aspects of the use of systemic  insecticides, including studies of deposition patterns and rates of  movement.  Leedy (8) and Rudd (10) pointed out the need for a cooperative  approach to pest control programs, and in the development of  methods that minimize hazards to fish and game. Systemics seldom  have been investigated for their effects on wildlife, although lab­oratory  tests for toxicity have been conducted. Rudd and Genelly  (11) did not report on the effects of systemics on wildlife in their  intensive treatment of the subject. These omissions may be due  to the relatively recent development and use of systemics, to the  rapid absorption by the plants, and to the initial unavailability of  the toxicant to wildlife. To date, no studies on the effects of  systemic insecticides on wild vertebrate populations have been  found in the literature. N. B. Kverno (pers. communication) told  of a study with tetramine to produce Douglas-fir seed repellent to  rodents using a bioassay with wild-trapped Pe""omysclts Zeucopus  Fisher as his only method of analysis. The method proved un­successful.  The need for such an evaluation wnl become even more  manifest as the use of systemics increases, and if low toxicity  insecticides show effects on populations of the smaller forest mam­mals.  JPitkin, F. H. and R. W. Portman (University of Idaho), unpublished data.  ( 4)  Descri ption of Test Areas  In 1964, the treatments were applied to Rocky Mountain  Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii var. giauca (Beissn.) Franco,  on the University of Idaho Experimental Forest near Princeton,  Idaho. The site is located on a flat bench in the foothills of Moscow  Mountain at 2,800 feet, and is dominated by seral Douglas-fir and  lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia Engelm. Other tree  species include: grand fir, Abies gmndis (Doug!.) Lind!.; western  larch, La,-;x occidentalis Nutt.; western redcedar, Thuja plicata  Donn; ponderosa pine, Pinus ponde1'osa val'. ponde,'osa Laws.;  and western white pine, Pinus monticola Doug!. The stand is quite  open due to past selective logging and intensive grazing. Some of  the trees approach 100 percent living crown. The understory is  dominated by Poa pratensis L. and T,-;folim/t ""epens L., with  scattered herbaceous weeds and small shrubs. The climax associ­ation  is Thuja plicata/ Pachistima mY1'Senites.'  The 1965 site is on the St. Joe National Forest, southern  Benewah County, approximately 1 mile northwest of Baldy Moun­tain  a long the ""Palouse Divide Road"" at an elevation of 4,050  feet, on a steep, north-facing slope. The site is dominated by seral  western white pine and Douglas-fir, with scattered western red­cedar,  grand fi r, and western larch, in order of decreasing abun­dance.  The undet'story is dominated by scattered, 10 to 15 foot  Scouler willow, Salix scoule""iana Barr., and relatively dense, 5 to  7 foot, Sitka alder, Alnus sinuata (Req.) Rydb., and various other  members of t he Pachistima union. Conifer reproduction is chiefly  western redcedar and scattered grand fir; the climax association  is Thuja plicata/ Pachistima my,·senites.'  Procedures  In 1964, two r eplicates of six Douglas-fir were selected as  test trees, with two in each r epl icate ser ving as controls. All were  selected for heavy, curr ent cone crop and suspected cone-insect  populations. Additional characteristics of the test trees are given  Table 1.

(5)  dosages during preliminary screening tests by Pitkin and Port­man3  .  The chemical was injected during the ear ly afternoon of J une  22 by means of ""Mauget Tree-lnjector Units,"" each of which con­tained  3 gms active toxicant (cover photo). The weather was  sunny and warm (70"" F) with a gentle breeze. Cones were pendent  and approximately 11/~ in. long, and shoot growth had reached 1-2  in.; thus both were in periods of great metabolic activity. The con­tents  of 8 units (24 gms) were introduced into each t ree (ca 1.7 to  2.7 gms per diameter inch) to a depth of % to 1 in. into t he sap­wood.  The times required for total absorption of the chemical  were recorded.  Cone and branch-tip samples were collected one week after  the treatment (June 29) and at two-week intervals t hereafter.  Samples of 24 cones each were obtained by handpicking 6 f rom t he  outer most one-foot portion of a single branch in each cardinal di­rection  of the cone-bearing crown of each tree'. Four, one-foot  branch-tips were collected from four different sides in each of the  upper, middle, and lower thirds of the crown. Sub-samples of both  cones and branch-tips (foliage) were ground in a Waring blend­er,  placed in plastic sacks labeled as to date and crown position, and  stored at 30"" F for subsequent determination of toxicant concen­tration'.  Branches in all parts of both test and control trees were  examined for signs of phytotoxic effects before and during t he  sampling period, and subsequent to the end of the 1964 tests.  Twelve cones from each tree and collection wer e placed in  rearing containers to obtain supplemental biological data. The  remaining cones from each tree and collection were examined, first  by the axial-slice method, and finally, by a scale-by-scale examina­tion.  The following information was recorded for each method:  number of insect damage and filled seed; species a nd number of  insects responsible for the observed damage; and insect mortality  by species. A representative sub-sample of larvae and pupae was  dissected to ascertain the percent parasitism of the host insect  species that were sufficiently abundant to provide an adequate  sample. All insect data were processed by IBM computer.  To examine the effects of oxydemetonmethyl on seed germina­tion  and early seedling development, cones were collectd in Sep­temb~  r from all crown levels and aspects from treated and control  trees; and the seed was hand-extracted. Empty seeds were elimi­nated  by water flotation. The seeds from all control trees were  combined to constitute one source, and those from all treated trees  r.trhe first cone sample from each branch was placed in a plastic bag, sealed,  and stored at 34 0 F until examined for seed loss and insect mortality. This  procedure caused 100 percent insect mortality in all cones, and subsequent  samples were placed in paper sacks.  dlnitial plans called for both qualitative and quantitative analysis for oxy­demetonmethyl  in cone tissue, twigs, and foliage, with subsequent determi­nation  of insect mortality-concentration curves, rates of translocation, and  metabolic by-products of the insecticide. Interference due to resins prevented  consulted chemists from obtaining this information.  (6)  constituted the second source. Moist seeds were stratified in plas­tic  sacks in the University of Idaho Forest Nursery cold house for  three months at about 40"" F, following standard nursery practice.  Three flats were prepared, each with 50 treated and 50 untreated  control seeds planted % in. deep in a randomized block design.  Each seed was located by a colored toothpick. The flats contained  a 1:1 mixture of nursery sand and ground peat, with 1 in. top­ping  of coarse sand. Flats were kept in a greenhouse in full light  with temperatures averaging 40-50"" F night and 65-78"" F day.  The number of germinated seed was recorded every other day  until all germination had ceased. More extensive tests were not  possible due to the low supply of seed remaining after intensive  cone sampling for insect activity.  A live-trapped colony of the deer mouse, Pe""omyscus leucopus  Fisher, and a colony of the laboratory white mouse, Mus musculus  L., were established and maintained in the laboratory to ascertain  the effects of a diet of seeds and cone tissue from treated trees.  Two groups, each made up of 5 deer mice, ,vere provided a diet of  treated and untreated cones, respectively, supplemented occasion­ally  with Purina Dog Chow. Both groups were stressed with in­adequate  food, and later, with water removal. Similar tests were  conducted for 15 months with 70 deer mice and some 400 white  mice. Records on mortality, weight, repellency, and behavior were  maintained. Exploratory dermal toxicity tests with 50 percent  technical material also were conducted.  In 1965, extensive cone-crop failure, an aerial spray for a  Douglas-fir tussock moth outbreak, and inability to obtain quanti­tative  analysis of the insecticide concentrations in the foiJage and  cones, resulted in a number of procedural modifications and  changes in research emphasis: (1) the study area was shifted to  a small group of cone-bearing Douglas-fir found in southern Bene­wah  County; (2) sixteen cones were collected from each of 20  trees making up two replicates of 10 control and 10 treated trees.  Eight cones were selected from each of the upper and lower halves  of the cone-bearing crowns, with no more than two selected from  anyone branch; (3) four cones from each tree were placed in  rearing and the remainder examined for seed loss and insect mor­tality,  using the axial-slice method only; (4) the dosage of oxy­demetonmethyl  was standardized at 1 gm per diameter inch for  each tree, which constituted a reduction in dosage from the pre­vious  year. Characteristics of the test trees used in 1965 are given  in Table 1. High cone losses to squirrels, and low insect popula­tion  complicated analysis of data. Weather at time of treatment  was cloudy, humid, and calm.  Four western white pine trees, supporting very light infesta­tions  of the cone beetle, Corwphtho?'t's monticolae Hopk., and the  cone moth, Eucosma Tescisso,'iana Hein., also were treated with  approximately 1 gm of oxydemetonmethyl (actual) per diameter  inch. Two untreated trees served as controls. The untreated trees  averaged 14.3 inches dbh, 56.5 feet in height, and were 93 percent  (7)  crown. Untreated trees averaged 12.8 inches dbh, 46.5 feet III  height, and were 86 percent crown.  Results  Efficiency of Procedures  A total of 1.75 hours were required by a 3-man crew to select,  prune, tag, and treat eight trees. Actual treatment, including  placement of feeder tubes and positioning eight injector units, re­quired  an average of 8.75 minutes per tree. Absorption of the sys­temic  into the Douglas-f ir trees was complete in 2.0 to 2.4 hours  under the variable weather conditions prevailing during t he 1964  treatment. A substantitally longer time of 3 days was requi red  the following year when cloudy, cool, and humid weather prevailed.  The feeder tubes were inserted deeper into the sapwood in 1965,  which also would tend to increase the time of absorption. Ab­sorption  by white pine was not complete until July 1, or about one  week after treatment.  In 1965, the odor of insecticide was detected in the crowns of  treated Douglas-fir during the first collection (July 1) one week  af,ter treatment, but was most apparent during the third collection  (July 29) . No odor was detectable during the fourth collection  on Aug. 12, nor on subsequent collection dates. No chemical odor  emanated from the foliage of treated white pine, except for a trace  on July 1, one week after treatment. Continual inspection for ab­normalities  such as chlorosis and changes in growth patterns, re­vealed  no differences between test and control trees.  Relationship Between Sample and Total Seed Counts  Cor relation analysis of 1964 seed counts obtained by the axial­slice  method and by total dissection confirmed the validity of the  sample method. Correlation coefficients by collection date ranged  from 0.54 to 0.97 for estimates of damaged seed, and from 0.49  to 0.61 for estimates of total seed per cone. All r-values were  highly significant.  Species Present  Four insect species were responsible for most, if not all, de­tectable  damage to the cones and seeds of Douglas-fir. These were:  Two cone moths, Ba1'bam colfaxiana (Kearf.) and Di01l1ch-ia  abieteUa (D. & S.) ; a gall midge, Conta1-inia sp.; and the seed  chalcid, M egastigmus spennoh'ophus Wacht!. All determined in­sect  specimens recovered from the Douglas-fir cones are presented  in Table 2. Identification of many specimens has not yet been  made. Some of the t reated trees had heavier infestations of tus­sock  moths than control trees, probably due to chance selection.  Effectiveness of Treatment  Reduction in seed loss .

Although significant variation appeared between trees  and replicates, percent seed losses from all causes in treated trees  averaged approximately one-fifth the losses in untreated trees.  For example, 20.3 percent of the available seed was destroyed in  the check trees, while only 3.6 percent was lost in the treated trees  21 days after treatment. The maximum reduction occurred 63  days afer treatment when 28.6 and 3.8 percent seed losses were  recorded in all check and t reated trees, respectively (Table 4, Fig­ure  1). In one instance (Rep. 26, 35 days), over half the available  seed from two untreated trees was destroyed in contrast to ap­proximately  9 percent of the seed from four treated trees in that  replicate. Seed losses from a single untreated tree in 1964 ranged  from 9.5 to 57.2 percent, and from 0.2 to 27.8 percent in a single  treated tree. The minimum in the untreated and the maximum in  the treated categories were unusual occurrences, and may reflect  potentials for improved treatment procedure and technology.  A comparison of 1964 average losses by major causal species  (Table 4) indicated a fairly even distribution between B. colfaxi­ana  and Conta,inia sp. on the basis of total available seed destroy­ed;  however, the between-t ree variation for Conta,inia was much  (10)  .... 0  ...J ...... .,  ~  ..,,  0  ...J  C  w  w  en  ~  ''0'  ...J  .c. .w,  0~  100  90  80  70  GO  50  40  30  20 UNTREATED_ -- 10  ----- --- - - TREATED  21 35 49 6 77  DAYS AFTER TREATMENT REP.  10  50 ...- ---- - 40 ....- - --- --- -- 3°b REATED'-  20  10 TREATED  21  100  90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20 UNTREATED_  10 TREATED -  21  I I I I  35 49 63 77  DAYS AfTER TREATMENT REP. 2  -----  35 49  I  63  ----  7~  DAYS AfTER TREATMENT REPS 1+2  Fig. 1.

Losses from both the  cone moth and the midge were reduced by the t reatment, but  Conta,'inia assumed a greater role as the cone moth population was  red uced. The phenomenon is even more evident when seed loss  data is presented as percent of damaged seed (Table 5), and is  believed to be due to the application of the insecticide after gall  formation (and seed destruction) was well advanced. Although  examinations of t he midge larvae were not made in all galls, ""spot  checks"" in treated and untreated cones from each collection indi­cated  complete mortality of the species in the treated cones, and  resulted in an overall red uction in number of galls initiated a nd  completed (Table 6).

In 1965, trunk injection of oxydemetonmethyl in Douglas-fir  at 1 gm per diameter inch fa iled to produce consistent significant  reductions in seed losses in bi-weekly collections. In most cases  there was as much variation between replicates as between treat­ments.  Significant red uctions in seed losses from all causes oc­curred  only at 7, 35, and 49 days after treatment; and from all  insects only at 35 and 63 days after treatment. However, losses  in the treated trees were slightly below those in the untreated  trees at each examination date (Table 7, Figure 4).  Seed losses in 1965 were assigned to all causes, to each causal  insect species, to all insect species, and to unknown causes (Table  7). Losses to B. colfaxiana (the major causal species) within  single replicates ranged from 2.6 to 38.8 percent in the untreated  and from 0.0 to 24.7 percent in the treated trees. Intensity of loss  due to this insect species tended to increase from a minimum at 7  days after treatment (July 1) to a maximum at 35 days after treat­ment  (July 29) in both untreated and treated trees.

Another cone moth, Dior'yct1-ia abietella, was not observed  until July 15 (21 days after treatment) when it was recorded in  small numbers in occasional cones from untreated trees.

Seed losses from all causes in untreated and treated Douglas-fir.  Northern Idaho, 1965. A. Replicate 1; B. Replicate 2; C. Combined  replicates.  (16)  Losses in the untreated trees from unknown causes ranged  from an average of 3.9 to 36.8 percent of the available seed, while  these losses in treated trees ranged from 2.8 to 51.3 percent (Table  7) . The substantial increase in seed loss from unknown causes  between the 35th and 49th days may be due, in part, to the increas­ing  difficulty in distinguishing between causal agents late in the  season.  Insufficient insect population in the western white pine treat­ed  in 1965 precluded statistical analysis; however, the data sug­gest  that treatment of this tree species at 1 gm per diameter inch  did not effect control of either the cone beetle, Conophth01'US  nwnticolae Hopk., or the cone moth, Eucosma ,-escisso""iana Hein.  Insect mortality. In 1964, highly significant differences in  mortality of B. col/axian(t were obtained between the untreated  and treated cones of Douglas-fir (Table 6). There also were sub­stantially  fewer larvae of this species recovered from the treated  than from the untreated cones, probably due to the rapid disinte­gration  of the small early-instal' larvae killed by the insecticide.  Samllle counts of dead and living midge larvae (Contarinia sp.)  withm the galls indicated that mortality of this species also was  very high, which was reflected in t he substantially fewer galls  produced in the treated cones. The effectiveness of the treatment  on other insect species could not be statistically determined; how­ever,  it was apparent that little or no control of the seed chalcid,  M. spe""nwth""ophus, or the cone moth, D. abietella, was achieved.  In the latter case, the reason may be t he appearance of t he insect  after maximum effectiveness of the insecticide (late July). The  parasitic species associated with B. col/axiana also were adver­sely  affected, with consistently fewer species and individuals  emerging from treated than untreated cones placed in rearing .  .. !..:.  ~  II: o  2  TREATED  UNTREATED  7  /  EFFECTIVE FEEDING PERIOD  21 56 4'  DAYS AFTER TREATMENT  Fig. 5. Percent mortality of Barbara colfaxiana in treated and untreated  Douglas-fir cones. Northern Idaho, 1965.  (17)  The results of the 1965 treatment were not as conclusive as  those of 1964, primarily because of insufficient data due to ex­tremely  low insect populations and to the reduced dosage of sys­temic.  Significant differences in percent mortality of B. colfaxiana  occurred only in the first and second cone col1ections, 7 and 21  days after treatment, respectively; however, there was lower mor­tality  recorded at each col1ection date in the untreated cones  (Figure 5). The seed cha1cid and the gal1 midges were not ki11ed  by the low dosage, although there were fewer midges recovered  from the cones of treated trees in al1 col1ections. Data on parasite  emergence were insufficient.  Seed ge""mination and seedling growth. Germination percent­ages  of treated and untreated seed were virtual1y identical. Of the  450 seeds sown in each treatment, 74 percent of the treated and 75  percent of the untreated seed successful1y germinated. The elimi­nation  of empty seeds and the relatively smal1 sample may have  been influential in the uniformity of germination obtained.  Seedlings were careful1y examined twice-weekly, and weekly  height measurements were taken for the first two months. They  were examined and measured once a month thereafter. In mid­May,  when germination was almost complete, the flats were set  out in dappled shade under field conditions. No abnormalities of  color or growth pattern were observed. Seedling development was  fol1owed through two growing seasons and then terminated.  Mammalian toxicity. No differences in general conditions,  behavior, mortality, fecundity, or survival of young were recorded  between either deer mice or white mice fed treat~d cones and those  fed only untreated food. Continuous contact with ""contaminated""  material in the cages also had no adverse effect. Dermal toxicity  tests were discontinued after extreme variability in effects oc­curred  with weight, age, and condition of the treated animals.  The deer mice, however, were less affected than the white mice.  Summary and Discussion  Introduction of a systemic insecticide into the trunks of Doug­las-  fir by means of ""Mauget Tree-Injector Units"" was proved  feasible. Injections of oxydemetonmethyl at 24 gms per tree (ca  2 gros per diameter inch) significantly reduced insect-caused seed  losses in open-growing, pole-sized trees in 1964. Percent seed  losses in treated trees averaged approximately one-fifth the losses  in untreated trees. In 1965, injection of the systemic at 1 gm per  diameter inch failed to produce consistent, significant reductions  in seed losses; however, losses in the treated trees were slightly less  than those in the untreated trees at each examination date.  Highly signif icant differences in mortality of Ba""bam col­faxiana  were obtained between untreated and treated cones in  1964. Sample counts of dead and living midge (Conta""inia sp.)  larvae within the gal1s indicated that mortality of this species also  (18)  was very high, and was reflected in the substantially fewer galls  produced in the t reated cones. The effectiveness of the 1964  treatment on other insect species could not be statisictally deter­mined  due to low population numbers; however, little or no con­trol  of the seed chalcid, Megastigmus spe'·""tot,·ophus, or of the cone  moth, DiO?""yctria abietella, was achieved. With the reduced dos­age  in 1965, significant differences in percent mortality of B.  colfaxiana occurred in only two collections, although there wa'  lower mortality in the untreated cones at each collection date.  Oxydemetonmethyl at either dosage did not produce discern­ible  phytotoxic symptoms in treated Douglas-fir, did not affect  geminative capacity, and had no apparent effect on seedling  growth or development. Test colonies of white mice and deer mice  fed treated cones showed no difference in behavior, fecundity, and  survival of young from those colonies fed untreated material.  It is believed that an experienced, 2-man crew, using an ef­ficient  carrying device for the insecticide-filled inj ector units,  could reduce treatment time substantially below the 8.75 minutes  per tree required in this study. Units of larger capacity also would  be advantageous, particularly in the treatment of large diameter  trees. Excessive displacement of the tube during insertion, or  positioning of the unit on the tube, may result in the loss of in­secticide  externally. Some leakage of insecticide from the in­jector  units occurred during storage and handling. Subsequent  modifications in unit construction by the manufacturer may have  eliminated this problem.  Although more detailed investigation of the effects of dif­ferent  dosages of oxydemetonmethyl on t he tree and its seed, and  on the various insect species contributing to seed loss in Douglas­fir  would be desirable, the results of this study show t he feasibil­ity  and effectiveness of ""selective treatment"" by use of trunk­injected  systemics. If only genetically superior cone bearing trees  in a seed production area or forest stand were treated, the impact  of the cone and seed insects could be utilized to establish a more  productive stand by destroying seed (reproduction) from inferior  trees. This practice would be less costly than broadcast applica­tion  and less distrupting to the faunal ecology. Returns from  marketable material and increased yield might further justify the  practice if it was done in conjunction with commercial thinings  or sanitation cuts.

More recently, color and color infrared (CIR)  photography have been found usefu l for inventory of  natural resources. In an investigation on Nevada  marshlands, Seher and Tueller (1973) reported that  color photography, combined with on-ground ana lysis,  provided permanent records of seasonal and yearly  marsh changes. They found evaluation of land treat­ment  and management practices possible with color  photography.

Montana has found low altitude 35mm color and CIR  photography valuable in range inventory ana lysis, as  well as for ident ifying waterfowl habitat condition and  potential (Cosgriffe et al. 1973, Meyer 1973, Meyer and  Gerbig 1974). Colwell (1960), using tones and textures  on infrared film, found the photography useful for dis­tinguishing  vegetation heights in the management of  wildland areas. Meyer and Gerbig (1974) noted that  CIR film exposed at photographic scales of 1:2000 and  I :3000 was adequate for assessing waterfow l habitat  with 35mm camera systems. Other studies uti lizing the  70mm CI R system found larger scales (I :600-1 :2000) ex­cellent  for distinguishing several forb and shrub species  (Driscoll 1971).  Driscoll (1969) states that an object's identification in  an aerial photograph should be based on characteristics  of the object as recorded by the remote sensor (camera  and film), and not as viewed firsthand. That is, featu res  of an object as seen with the naked eye may differ in  appearance on photographs, depend ing on t he  characteristics of film and camera.  Color infrared photography relies on both visible and  infrared light renectance from objects photographed.  The degree of absorption or renectance is dependent  upon the morphology and physiology of the objoct. For  example, actively growing vegetation registers as red or  pink on CIR film , differing in shade with vegetation  type and species. In active vegetation, while appearing  green to the human eye, may appear a dark shade of red  or brown on CI R film . Bare ground or rocks will appear  white on CI R; litter appears light brown. Water, depen­ding  on depth and movement, will appear either light or  dark blue, or bl ack if stagnant.  Cooperative investigation between the University of  Idaho and the U. S. Forest Service was initiated in 1974  to evaluate the effects of a grazing system on stream­meadow  ecosystems in central Idaho. One of the major  objectives of the project was to devise procedures for  maki ng an evaluation. CIR photography was tested as a  means of providing a permanent base for monitoring  both vegetation and stream channel changes. Identifica­tion  of vegetation strata was an additional asset offered  by the CIR film .  Project study areas were chosen within the Idaho  Bat holith , and include portions of the stream-meadow  complexes of Elk Creek (Corduroy Meadows), Joh nson  Creek (Tyndall Meadows), and the South Fork of the  Salmon Ri ver (Stolle Meadows). Meadows along Elk  and Johnson creeks range in elevation from 6400 to 6700  ft (1951 m to 2042 m), and are under three-pasture rest­rotation.  Lodgepole pine vegetation borders these  meadow areas. Stolle Meadows ranges in elevation from  5300 to 6700 ft (1615 m to 2042 m). Lower elevation  areas are enclosed in Lodgepole pine while the upper  meadow sites occur within the Spruce-Fir zo ne. The  Sto lle Meadow a rea has been ungrazed for at least a  decade.  PROCEDURE  Permanent line transects were employed to gather  data on vegetat ion attributes (compositio n. and cover).  animal behavior and stream channel stabi lit y.  Photography (CIR) was obtained with a 70mm  camera mounted in a vertical position in a small, high­wing  ai rcraft. The 70mm system has been found to have  sig nificant adva ntages over conventional 35mm camera  types. Capabilities of the system, when combined with  low-level !light, allow for high resolution stereoviewing  with a small, 70mm x 70mm format (Driscoll 1971).  For this stream-meadow assessment, two !lights were  made: the first on 14 July of 1975 and the second on 24  September of 1975. Since specific study sites had not  been selected, the first !light generally covered the three  stream-meadow co mplexes. Scales of I :2000 and 1:8000  were photographed. The fall flight was restricted to  I :8000 sca le, and covered the study sites within each  complex more specifically. A Hulcher 70mm camera  (M odel 102), equipped with a Schneider Xenutan  150mm lens, was used on both !lights. Eastman Kodak  Aerochrome Infrared film (Type 2443)' was exposed  and processed by the Remote Sensing Research Unit in  the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences.'  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Despite some camera malfunctions on the fir st !light,  the CI R photography has proven extremely useful for  the assessment of grazing systems on st ream-meadow  ecosystems.  Site Evaluation  The knowledge of existing environmental conditions  affec tin g vegetation cha ra cteristics is key to successful  in ventory and evaluation of vegetation with aerial  photography.  With CI R photography of I :8000 scale, vegetal  ""zones"" have been identified within the stream-meadow  ecosystems se lected for study. These zones are  predominantly rel ated to soil depth and available  moisture. The stream bank area is characterized by a  mixture of Carex species and rhizomatous forbs and  grasses. An interm ed iate zone exists between the st ream­bank  and the drier, outer meadow a reas, containing a  mixture of Carex. Juncus. and Salix species. Bunchgrass  species and taprooted forbs comprise the majo rity of  vegetat ion of the outer meadow area. Each zone was  identifiable during the growing season and in the fall.  Moisture being the determinant for zone separation,  growth periods were re!lected on CIR through dormant  or active vegetati on. Seher and Tueller (1973) in their  work on marshlands, found that photographic cover  ana lysis cou ld adequately quantify emergent and sub­mergent  vegetation. Meyer ( 1974) was able to classify  aquatic vegetation types through CIR ph otography with  a minimum of ground sa mpling.  Within the stream-meadow complexes, identification  of woody shrub species, such as Salix, is possible with  1:2000 scale CIR photography. Life form identification  (g rasses-grassl ikes versus shrubs) was also possible with  the same scale CI R photos. As other work has shown,  larger scale photography (I :600-1 :2000) may permit  ident ification of individual species. Driscoll (1971) was  able to identify several species of shrubs and larger forbs  with CI R photography at scales of I :600. Seher and  JReference to this IiIm type is not meant as an advertisement.  4The assistance of Robert Heiler, Dr. Joseph Ulliman. and graduate  assistants Hal Anderson and Wayne Miller of the Remote Sensing  Research Unit. is greatly appreciated for photographic support of this  manuscript.  10 CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN TH.IS FLOOR  Tueller (1973) were able to construct CI R photographic  keys for identifica tion of 10 major types of marsh  vegetatio n, utilizing pl ant height, color, and texture.  C I R photographs (I :2000-1 :8000 scale) can clea rly  define a lterati ons in vegetation cover and subsequent  changes in bare surface area . The abundance of vegeta­tion  or plant ma terial in the form of litter on stream­meadow  sites allows for easy detection of bare ground  with C IR, both during and after the growing season.  Also noticeable in areas dominated by forbs such as  mulesears (Wyethia ampiexicaulis), is the increase of  bare ground in CIR photos taken in the fall. While  providing an a lmost continuous cover in July (appearing  red dotted on 1:8000 CIR), these forbs become dorm a nt  in late summer; by fall the same area shows an increase  in bare ground. The resulting image appears light brown  or white.  The innux of sediment from direct runoff due to iden ­tifiable  causes, such as road construction or logging, was  identified with CIR photography of 1:8000 scale. For an  invento ry analysis on Nevada rangelands, Tueller ( 1975)  utilized C IR photography (1:600 scale) for marking  areas susceptible to erosion increases. With additional  work other possibilities for detection of susceptible ero­sion  areas will be feasible.  Indication of range trend appea rs as subsequent  cha nge in vegetation communities due to treatments or  practices. Though not recognizable from existing  photography, future CIR photos taken of these stream­meadow  ecosystems may reveal changes in life form  abunda nce or perimeters of vegetation zones. The first  CI R photos could serve as a base to observe vegetation  and erosion co nditio ns through future years.  Stream Channel Stability  The nat ura l process of stream channel alteration has  been noted with color photography (Watson and Hoyle  1975). Whet her grazing systems influence this process,  by enhancing or inhibiting change, is a major source of  connict. Thro ugh the use of CIR photography, com­pari  son can be made of any change occurring seasonally  o r yea rly. Cha nnel alterations such as bank slough-off  o r c han nel obstruction can be detected on CIR  photography. Ground checks and monitoring with sub­sequent  photography enable the manager to evaluate  stream cha nnel alteration. Comparison with simil ar but  ungrazed stream-meadow complexes, as has been done  with the current cooperative study, a ids in determining  Ihe effect of a grazi ng system on stream habitat.  Animal Behavior  Color infrared photography offers insights into the  little understood field of animal behavior. In slTeam­meadow  complexes, recognition of fecal material was  possible with I :2000 scale photos. Photography of la rger  scales ( I :600-1 : 1000) could reveal more identifiable fecal  g ro upin gs, indicating a reas of concentrated use .  Seasonal changes of fecal distributions could be es­pecially  releva nt in meadow ecosystems. Tueller (1975).  with C I R photography of I :600 sca le, was able to  recog nize evidence of grazing pressure through the  amount of fecal droppings located on the photographs.  Cattle trai ls within these meadow areas have a lso been  delineated with both 1:2000 and 1:8000 sca le CIR  photos, in both summer and fall seasons. The use or  avoidance of vegetation zones has been recognized, as  well as watering areas. As present photography of these  stream-meadow complexes taken in the fall indicates,  larger sca le CIR photos (1:600-1:1000) could a id in  detection of differences between grazed and ungrazed  a reas with in a single complex.  SUMMARY  Color infrared photography of large scales (I :2000-  I :8000) can provide the resource a nalyst with a method  fo r observing the innuence of ma nagement systems  (specifica lly grazing programs) on stream-meadow com­plexes.  Vegeta l stratification and identification can be  accomplished, as well as providing a base for further  observation of vegetation change. C I R use enables  current and future evaluation of range condition and  trend. Stream channel stability and alteration can be  monitored. CIR photography can aid the manager in his  understanding of grazing animal behavior, and provide  info rmation on the effect this behavior has on the  stream-meadow environment.

Fosberg'  INTRODUCTION  Inventory of range lands to determine their current  cover and actual potential is a basic requirement for  management. The problem of obtaining adequate range  inventories and periodically updating them has been a  critical one since the earliest days of range manage­ment.  Difficulties have resulted from a number of factors,  including the large size of the areas involved, their  diversity, and the severe limitations of funds available  for inventory purposes. In addition, subsequent changes  in land use often render parts of an inventory obsolete  soon after it has been made. All of these conditions  exist in Idaho where a 30 million acre (12 million hal  area south of the Idaho batholith contains some 25  million acres (10 mill ion hal of rangeland. Most of this  range is in the sagebrush-grass zone, and despite  superficial uniformity, contains many different types of  range vegetation.  Much of the vegetation has been drastically altered  by fire and past abusive grazing use. To further compli­cate  the situation, exotic annuals from the Mediterran­ean  reg ion presently dominate the landscape over ex­tensive  ar( ~o S , and vegetation cover types not present  in presettiament per iods are widespread. Moreover,  nearly 2.0 mill ion acres (0.8 million hal of depleted  ranges have been artificially seeded to c rested wheat­grass  and other introduced forage speci es, thus pro­ducing  additional range types. In addition to these  sources of range variability rapid changes in land use  are now occurring, especially in the conversion of range  to irrigated crop lands. As a result of all these factors,  classification of range lands in southern Idaho and  monitoring of changes in their use has not been car­ried  out in a comprehensive and continuing program,  but has remained spotty and incomplete.  lPublished with approval 01 the Director, Forest, Wil dlife and Range Ex­periment  Statton, Unn/ersity of Idaho, Moscow.

The communities in /he lower  center are Burley-Rupert, and American Falls in the lower  right corner.  2  One of the more promising methods for supplement­ing  ground procedures for the inventory of range or  other natural resources is by means of remote sensing.  This term refers to acquiring information about objects  from a distance, whether from a satellite vehicle, an  aircraft or a platform a few feet from the ground. Aerial  photog raphs taken from elevations of 5,000-25,000 ft  (1,500-7,500 m) represent a common type of remote  sensing, and until recently were the only form available  for range inventories. Photos of this type have been  used in range inventory during the past 25 years, but  they have certain limitations for this purpose. First, the  area covered by each photo is relatively small, so that  r1)any photos are needed for a sizable range area. Also,  there is significant distortion on the edges of photos  taken from such elevations, and a large degree of over­lap  is required in order to provide accurate mosaics  which must be made from the central portions of the  photos. Another adverse factor is the time required to  cover a large range area, making it difficult to obtain  uniformity of lighting over the entire area. Finally, photos  of this type were usually made with a standard black  and white film, sensitive only to a portion of the visible  spectrum. Recently color film has received increased  use fo , fo restry purposes, but its use increases the  photographiC costs considerably.  Improvements in techniques, equipment and films  made during and since World War II have greatly ex­tended  the utility of remote sensing for inventory of  natural resources. Improved lenses and other equip­ment  have made it possible to obtain images of great  clarity and definition from much higher elevations than  was possible in earlier years. The development of im­proved  films and filters sensitive to different parts of  the visible and the infrared spectrum has also greatly  increased the amount of information available by re­mote  sensing.  Fig. I. Black and white print of band 5 ERTS-I (now ('ailed  LANDSAT-I ) imagery of southwest Idaho, October 1972.  Portions of Treasure Valley (Boise) and Magic Valley (Twin  Falls) are located in the upper len and center right, re­speC'tively,  wilh the Snake River tra versing east /0 west  acrOIlll the mid por/ion of the photograph. Other than the  major drainage systems, dark images were identified as  areas supporting actively growing vegetation (coniferous  forest at top of photograph ) or irrigated crops. Various  shades of grey were areas of dormant or sparse range vege­tation  and harvested croplands.  The most spectacular recent advance in remote  sensing has been the development of the Earth Re­sources  Technology Satellite by the National Aeronau­tics  and Space Administration (NASA). This satellite  was put into orbit in July 1972, and functioned for over  two years before reaching the end of its working life.  During this period it produced an extraordinary amount  of information regard ing the natural resources of earth.  ERTS-1 revolved in a circular orbit 570 miles (917  km) above the earth. Fourteen orbits were made each  day, obtaining imagery of strips 115 miles (185 km)  wide, with a 14 percent overlap between orbit paths to  provide limited stereo coverage. Anyone location of  the earth's surface was covered every 18 days in a  continuing sequence. Earth resources data were col­lected  by a multispectral scanning device (MSS system)  which operates in two wave bands of the visible spec­trum  (green and red), and two in the near infrared.  This information was actually obtained as impulses of  reflected light energy impinging on ,filtered detectors  and transmitted to earth as electrical impulses where  they were reproduced as photographs, or as digital  tapes for computer analysis. Each photoframe covered  an area of 8.5 million acres (3.4 million hal and an  image was obtained simultaneously on each of the four  bands.  It appeared that this high altitude, multi band, re­petitive  imagery might provide a valuable approach for  classify ing major range types and monitoring their use.  The slowness and difficulty of studying a 25 million acre  (10 million hal area entirely by ground methods sug­gested  the value of testing the ERTS imagery. The op­portunity  arose in September 1972, when the authors  obtained a grant from NASA for this purpose. The re­search  reported here was conducted during 18 months  of the contract with NASA. Southern Idaho was chosen  as the study area because of the extensive range re­source  it contains and because of the large amount of  ground truth already obtained on the vegetation and  soils of the area.  THE STUDY AREA  Most of the cultivated, irrigated lands of south­western  Idaho are restricted to a 10-20 mile (16-32 km)  zone along the Snake River and the lower drainage of  the Boise and Payette rivers. Outside of these areas,  rangelands dominate the landscape, exceRt where the  precipitation exceeds 20 in (500 mm) annually and for­est  vegetation becomes important. Preci pitation in th is  portion of the state ranges from less than 7 in (175  mm) to more than 30 in (760 mm) annually and the  elevation varies from 2,100 ft (1 ,200 m) to more than  10,000 ft (3,000 m) above sea-level. Soils are highly  varied and are derived from parent materials that in­clude  loess, basalt, welded tuffs, rhyolite. granite and  alluvium, each occurring over extensive areas. The  orig inal vegetation, being the product of climate, soil,  relief and time, varied from xeric salt-desert shrub  vegetation to the mesic Douglas-fir and spruce/fir for­ests  at the higher elevations. Man's manipulation of the  landscape has affected all of the original vegetation  through varying degrees of disturbance by grazing,  cultivation, fire, and logging, and through the intro­duction  of exotic plant and animal species. These in­fluences  have further increased the variability of the  vegetation.  4  METHODS OF INVESTIGATION  The present study was conducted using only thl  photographic material from ERTS-1 , in the form of 71  mm (2% x 2% in) transparencies and enlarged print  made from these.  Sets of ERTS photos of the study area taken at fou  different dates during 1972 and 1973 were used t,  determine seasonal differences in the imagery of rang'  types and to detect changes in land use.  The relative effectiveness of the different wav(  bands in delineating landscape features was first testee  by viewing each one separately as a black and whitt  image. Further information was then obtained by view·  ing the different band in combinations of 2, 3, or 4 b\  means of a color additive viewer and projector. Th(  false color images produced by this procedure werE  helpful in further recognition of ground features, par·  ticularly vegetation.  Viewing of the ERTS films was followed by makin~  enlarged prints in black and white, on a scale 01  1 :500,000. In addition, paper tracings' were made on &lt;  scale of 1 :250,000 from projected images. Color en·  hanced imagery was used for the latter, and all observec  images were delineated. Both enlargements and trac·  ings were used to check against ground truth in the  field.  Field inspections were made primarily in areas  where prior ground truth information was deficient. AI  each inspection site the vegetation was characterized  by abundance ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 (rare to domi­nant).  In addition to describing the prE'sent plant cover,  the site was classified by its probable potential vegeta­tion.  A description of the soil profile was made in ac­cordance  with standard survey procedures, and the soil  was classified according to current soil taxonomy.  These ground truth observations were supplemented  by a road log of vegetation which totaled 1,200 miles  of vegetation traverse. These data helped in determin­ing  the distribution of vegetation types.  Due to the large size of the study area. it was de­cided  early in the investigation to confine the most  detailed work to rangelands in southwest Idaho. The  area was chosen for the variability in range types and  the amount of ground truth available.  Limited coverage by another kind of remote sensing  imagery from high elevation aircraft was obtained  through courtesy of the Ames Research Cenler of NASA,  localed at Moffett Field, CA. Coverage was made for  one time only on pre-designated flight strips in several  parts of the study area. This imagery, taken from an  elevation of 65,000 ft (19,500 m) was used to aid in  the interpretation of features not shown clearly by the  ERTS imagery and photos.  RESULTS  The results obtained to date in this study are pre­sented  here in three main groups: image recognition,  vegetation mapping and monito ring land use.  Image Recognition and Interpretation  An ERTS image of the study area (Fig. 1) illustrates  the kinds of in formation available from satellite imagery  without color enhancement. Land features such as  major drainages, mountainous areas, lava flows and  playas are shown clearly. Man-made features including  large reservoi rs, urban areas and major highways can  also be recognized. Land use patterns and natural  vegelation types are also discernible, but with varying  degrees of d istinctness. It was for these features espec­ially  that further utilization of multiband, sequential  imagery was necessary for recognit ion and interpreta­tion.  Usefulness of Different Wave Bands  Significant information was obtained from viewing  individual wave bands of the black and white trans­parencies,  but additional data were provided by multi­band,  color enhanced imagery. Band 5 (600-700 nano­meter)  covering the red part of the spectrum showed  the distribution of the major vegetation types and dis­linguished  these clearly from cultivated lands. Band 7  (800-1,100 nm) in the near infrared was useful for dis­tinguishing  bodies of water, drainage channels and  most geological features, but was inferior to Band 5 for  showing vegetation. Dry and dormant vegetation was  trendered poorly in both bands. The other two bands,  ros. 4 (500-600 nm) and 6 (700-800 nm), also showed  any features, but were not as useful as bands 5 or 7.  Color . nhanced, multispect ral imagery composed  f bands 5 and 7 with green and red filters proved to be  he best combination for the purpose of this study.  egetational features which were subdued or obscured  n black and white single-bbnd imagery showed well  n these color-enhanced photos.  alue of Sequential Imagery  Although multispectral, color enhanced imagery  rom a single ERTS recording was highly useful in de­icting  veg etation, much additional information was  btained by viewing the same scene during different  tages of vegetational growth and activity. For example,  agebrush stands could be separated from cheatgrass  ith imagery obtained in the spring due to high re-  I'ectance from the rapidly growing grass. Later in the  season these two vegetation types were often indis­'  lingUiShable, due mainly to the low infrared reflectance  rom both sagebrush and dried cheatgrass.  ecognition of Specilic Features  Using the combined inlormation provided by multi­Dand,  sequential ERTS imagery and the interpretive  kxperience of the authors, supported with additional  ,round observations, many images 01 more subtle land  'eatures were recognized. Heavy reliance was placed  )n color, density, texture, shape, and pattern for image  nterpretation. Evaluation of the accuracy with which  mages were identified as compared with subsequent  ~round checks was biased because of the interpreters'  revious familiarity with the area under investigation.  hus, no quantitative analysisof the expected accuracies  ~ hen using ERTS data was undertaken.  5  Cultivated vs. Uncultivated lands  One of the most clear-cut distinctions found on  ERTS imagery was that between cultivated and un­cultivated  lands. The cultivated areas could also be  subdivided into irrigated and dry land operations, as  determined primarily by the amount of infrared re­fl  ectance from the crops produced. A further division  of irrigated fields into annual row crops such as beans  and sugar beets, versus perennial forage crops or pas­tures  was also possible with the aid of sequential  imagery. Dry farmi""ng areas with vigorous growth and  relatively high productivity could likewise be distin­guished  from marginal areas with sparse production.  Identification of specific cultivated crops was beyond  the scope of this project, but prel iminary examination  of the color enhanced imagery and the results of re­mote  sensing research in other parts of the country  indicate that much can be done in this regard.  Another category of land treatment shown by the  ERTS images was that of reseeded rangelands. These  are common in southern Idaho where a major form of  range improvement consists of conversion 01 depleted  sagebrush-grass range areas to a more productive  forage cover by reseeding to suitable species, mainly  crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum). The pro­cedure  for conversion generally involves removal of  most of the sagebrush and other existing vegetation by  shallow disc plowing, spraying with herbicides or burn­ing,  followed by seeding of the forage speCies with a  drill. Reseeding of sagebrush areas has attained a high  degree 01 success, but attempts to reseed areas domi­nated  by cheatgrass or other annual grasses have been  less satisfactory due to difficulty in reducing competi­tion  from the existing plant cover.  Only qualilied success was obtained in identifying  reseeded ranges in the study area. Highly successful  and relatively recent seedings were indicated by their  distinct edges and difference in tone Irom adjacent  vegetation. Crested wheatgrass stands, however,  showed low inlrared reflectance even during the period  01 lush growth in spring. This effect was contrary to the  results 01 the closeup color inlrared photography, and  is believed to be due to the high percentage of bare  ground present in most reseeded ranges. As a result,  the majority of seedings could be identilied only by  sequential imagery which distinguished them from the  high reflectance of cheatgrass stands in the spring, and  from sagebrush stands by differences in tone on either  black and white or color images. Older seedings or  those containing a high percentage of annuals or sage­brush  were difficult to identify or delineate.  Native Range Types  Much variation was found in the extent to which  native range vegetation types would be identified on  ERTS images and in the characteristics which proved  useful for this purpose. For example, the shadscale  zone, located in the driest part of the study area, with  an average annual precipitation of about 6 in (150 mm)  exhibits sparse plant cover and light colored soil sur­face.  The high amount of reflectance from the soil  tended to mask the effects 01 vegetation in ERTS  imagery 01 this zone. The presence of other salt desert  shrub communities within the shad scale zone could not  _ Ronge ... dinG'  _ Irrigol.d c,opron~  C=:t low .ogebrtnh / f"".e"".  for •• tf Douglas-fir / A$pen)  VEGETATION TYPE MAP  • Mt.

The mountain big sagebrush/Idaho fescue  type was differentiated from the basin big sagebrush­I  bluebunch wheatgrass type by the greater reflectance  lot the former shown in spring and summer imagery. At  higher elevations, analysis of fafl imagery separated  I the mountain shrub and aspen-dominated communities  from adjacent sagebrush-g rass vegetation.  Many other types of sagebrush-grass vegetation  known to exist in the study area could not be differenti.­ated  by ERTS imagery. The low refl ectance from all  major sagebrush species throughout the growing sea­son  made many of these types look alike in the ERTS  imagery.  Range Burns  I  Recent burns in sagebrush-grass type areas were  visable in detail for one to two years after the fire. It  appeared that ERTS imagery could provide a rapid and  accurate method of delineating and measuring burned  areas. Burns in annual grass areas were more difficult  to recog nize after a few months.  VEGETATION MAPPING  The vegetation map of the Mountain Home-Jar­bidge  Mountain area shown in Fig. 2 was produced  from ERTS imagery, supplemented by ground truth  l  information. All divisions shown on the map could be  seen in ERTS imagery. This is a second generation  map, derived from the study and interpretation of images  riginally delineated at a scale of 1 :250,000. The vege­ation  type lines shown on the map were based on in­erpretation  of these images, and on the use of ERTS  equential imagery. In portions of the mapped uma for  hich U-2 high flight coverage was availab.e, this  imagery was used to check the accuracy of the ERTS  image ry. In cases where discrepancies were found be­ween  photos from the two sources, the U-2 imagery  ·nterpretation was accepted.  While this vegetation map does not show alt pos­ible  separation of range types, it does include all the  roader types, plus various forms of land use, range  reseeding, etc. It is the most comprehensive and up to  ate land resource map available of the area, and was  repared at a small f raction of the cost that would have  een required for a purely ground study approach. This  map should be valuable to all agencies or individuals  oncerned with land use in the area.  MONITORING LAND USE  One of the more desirable features of ERTS  Imagery for land managers is the possible recurring  poverage of the same site at relative ly short intervals  (18 days). Seldom does an investigation receive cover­~  ge this frequenlly, because of Clouds or equipment  Fig. 2.

Original scale 1:250.000.  7  malfunctions; however, even with imagery from only  four to five passes during parts of two yea rs we were  able to monitor the following changes:  (a) Conversion of rangeland to cultivated and ir­rigated  crops, particularly in areas adjacent to the  Snake River where pump irrigation is feasible. In some  cases the whole conversion process occurred in less  than six months. Such changes would be difficult to  monitor over so large an area by any other method.  The type of irrigated crop, whether row crop or perennial  hay or pasture could also be determined.  (b) The location, extent, and configuration of burns  in sagebrush-grass range was also detected by the  sequential ERTS imagery. Such quick and accurate  information is basic for land managers in evaluating  the impact of fire for a given year, and for planning  rehabilitation measures.  Other examples of monito ring land use would un­doubtedly  be found if sequential coverage were con­tinued  for a longer period.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  An initial evaluation of ERTS imagery as a tool for  classification of range and associated lands and for  monitoring and planning land use was made during an  18-month period in 1972-1973. While all of Idaho south  of the central mountainous area was included, particu­lar  emphasis was placed on study of an area about 115  by 110 miles (185 by 177 km) in extent, which for the  most part was included in the coverage 'f a single  ERTS image.  ERTS imagery was used in the form of both single  waveband black and white frames and color-enhanced  imagery produced with a color additive viewer and  projector. Repetitive coverage for four passes of ERTS  was used, covering the fall of 1972 and spring and sum­mer  of 1973. Interpretation of the ERTS imagery was  assisted by ground truth from previous research and  by additional field work in 1973.  The results indicate the capability of ERTS imagery  when combined with small-scale CIR photos and ground  truth to provide timely information on a variety of physiO­graphic  and cultural features, differentiation of cultiva­ted  versus rangeland use, and classification of many  major range types. Disturbance factors such as recent  burns in sagebrush-grass ranges and many range re­seeded  areas were also identifiable.  Many physiog raphic and cultu ral featu res showed  clearly on single-band, black and white ERTS photos.  Better results for the interpretation of vegetation were  usually obtained from color enhanced imagery pro­duced  by superimposing two or more of the four bands  available for each scene. Bands 5 and 7, covering the  red and near infrared portions of the spectrum re­spectively,  were found to be the mas! useful of the fou{  bands whether used singly or in combination.",,,2014-09-03,2018-11-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/fwres/id/100,100,19.pdf,/fwres/image/19.pdf,fwres100

INTRODUCTION  Small private woodlots throughout the Pacific North­west  frequently do not attain maximum wood fiber pro­duction  because they receive little or no stand management.  In many cases productivity, and hence the attainment of  merchantablt:' trees, is seriously reduced by the o vercrowd­ing  of individual stems. Thinning is a simple method that  land managers employ to alleviate overcrowding, thereby  reallocating the available growing space to se lected crop  trees. Crop trees from thinned plots will grow more rapid ly  than comparable trees from unthinned plots, reSUlting in  the production of more usable, high-value wood products  for the landowner.

Stated another way, this  means that the number of years required for a selected  crop tree to grow 1 inch in diameter was 4 .5, while I inch  diameter growth for a tree from an unthinned plot required  16.7 years or over three and three-quarter times ~s long.  Ave rage annual basal area growth increased from 2.5 sq ft  per acre on the un thinned plots to 4.0 sq ft per acre , or a  160 percent increase from thinning. Net volume growth  averaged 42 .4 ell ft per acre per year for the unthinned  stands, while thinning resulted in a yearly average increase  of over one and one-half times (165 percent) to 68.8 cu  ft per acre per year.  Additionally , volume growth per crop tree increased  from 0 .07 cu ft per year to 0 .32 cu ft per year. Thus, the  average crop tree after thinning is producing four and  one-half times as much wood fiber per year as the average  tree from an unthinned plot. Testing has shown stati stically  significant growth differences in the fou r comparisons  between thinned and un thinned plots.  WHAT THIS MEANS TO THE LANDOWNER  The thinning of young-growth ponderosa pine is  beneficial to the landowner in a variety of ways. This  study has iUustrated that thinned pine plantations can  result in:  1. increased growth of the se lected crop trees,  resulting in  2. more rapid attainment of a marketable high ­value  wood product, resulting in  3. a faste r and usually higher monetary return to  the landowner.  Addi tionally, thinning overcrowded pine planta­tions  results in a more vigorous plantation which is usually  less vulnerable to insect and disease problems.  GLOSSARY  1.  2.

Pitkin 2:  INTRODUCTION  Many acres of potential forest land in the United States remain unstocked  beca use landowners are aware of the high incidence of unsuccessful pla ntations  a nd are unwilling to accept plaming ri sks. Reforesta tion by planting does  involve considerable ri sk whenever it is practi ced, but in northern Idaho the hot,  dry summers make the possibility of' fai lure particula rly ac ute. However, the  increasing demand for wood a nd wood products, together with the increasing  emphasis on planting as a method of reforestation, requires that technjques  be developed to insure the survival of a higher percentage of planted seed­lings.  T oward this end, most investigations have been concerned with meth­ods  of si te modification and genetic improvement of planting stock. The pos­sible  alteration of the growth cha racteri stics of seedlings with plant growth  regulators as a mea ns for increasing survival has, on the other ha nd , received  little attention .  When soil moisture is at or below the wilting point , seedlings with small  tops a nd la rge root systems should theoretically have a higher potential to  survive than seedlings with large tops and small root systems. The root system  of the former type of seedling would be able to extract moisture from greater soil  volumes whi le transpiration from their smaller tops would be lower than of  seedlings with la rger tops. Thus, the internal water relations of such pla nts  should be improved. Si nce Loewenstein and Pitkin (196 1) reported that the  major cause of high seedling mortali ty in northern Idaho is the lack of available  soil moisture during the latter pan-of the grow ing season , it seems probable  that the su rviva l o[ pla nted seedlings would be favored i[ seedlings developed  a small top, but large root system , during the first growing season. If seed­lings  could be chemica lly treated so that root growth would be favored over  ShOOl growth during the first critical year after planting, the chances of sur­viva  l under droughty conditions might be improved.

TO CIR( I 2 TE SEE  L'r{~ '"" Q! ~N. i HI."" ~ _001(  Maleic hydrazide (M H) is a plant growth inhibitor which has been used IIi  horticultura l a nd agri cultural practices for about 25 yea rs. Used primarily to  prevent sprouting of stored potatoes and suckering in tobacco, MH more  recently has been used to increase the length of the dormant period in citrus  trees (Hendershott, 1962). Greulach and Haesloop ( 1954) had earlier shown  that internodal elongation in certain plants was reduced by MH. These  findings suggest that MH may red ace the shoot growth 01"" conifer seedlings.  Other workers have reported some root gro~vth inhibition by MH in certain  pla nts, but not in others (Naylor and Davis, 1950). Leopold and Klein ( 1952)  were the first to suggest that this inhibition could be reversed with au~i n . Vogt  and Cox (1970) recentl y showed that MH exerts an antagoni stic effect on the  inhibitory action of high levels of the a uxin indolacetic acid (IAA) on stump  sprouting by oaks.  The objective of this resea rch was to determine if the growth characteri st ics  of Douglas fir (Pseudo/suga menziesii var. glauca ) seedlings could be a ltered  with NIH and certain a uxins, and to eva luate the effect of the a lteration , if a ny,  on the surviva l of planted seedlings under field conditions.  METHODS  Two greenhouse experiments and one field study were utilized during the  course of the in vestiga tion. Field work was not a ttempted until greenhouse  ex periments revealed treatments of potential value to seedling survival in the  natural environment.  The initial greenhouse experiment was designed to ascertain the effects of  MH, when used a lone, on growth and development of Douglas fir seedlings.  The second experiment again included the MH treatment , but in  addition root systems were treated with va rious aux ins. Seedlings were  trea ted by immersing either tops or roots in a glass vessel containing a parti­cular  growth substa nce solution. Treatment solutions of MH were prepared  by di ssolving the powdered substance in a few milliliters of diethylamine  and wa ter a nd diluting to the desired volume with di sti lled water. Treatment  solutions of the auxins were prepared by dissolvi ng indolebutyric acid (I BA)  a ndt or lAA in a few milli liters of 95 percent ethy l alcohol a nd di luting to  volume with di stilled water.  In the first experiment , four groups of twelve 2-0 seedlings were root-pruned  to 5 inches and trea ted with MH (T a ble I ). During the topsoak period , root  systems were enclosed in a moist polyethylene bag to prevent desicca tion.  Treated seedlings were pla nted in a completely ra ndomized design 10 glass­faced  root boxes filled with sterile sa nd. Seedlings were grown under natural  photo-periods (mid-June) for one month, during which tap water was added as  needed.  Treatments imposed on seedlings in Experiment 2 are a lso li sted in T a ble 1.  Each treatment included 18 seedlings whi ch were plantr.d in pots (completely  randomized design) containing equal pa rts of sa nd , pea t, a nd soil. Seedlings  used in this experiment were 2-1 , rather than 2-0, a nd root systems were pruned  to 8 inches instead of 5 inches. The experiment lasted for 2 months, during  which natura l daylight was supplemented with Gre-Lux lights set for 14- hour  photoperiods. Approximately 1 inch of tap water was applied to each pot per  week.  OF RAttY  In the first experiment the total number of buds broken at the end of one  month was recorded. Seedlings were then lifted from their containers and top  and root growth measured. The longest new shoot a nd root was measured from  the point of growth inception to the tip of the organ. In the second experiment,  the number of broken buds was recorded at interva ls of severa l days. Also, the  number of roots with new growth in excess of O.S inches were counted on each  seedling.

The  field study si te was located on the Rathdrum Pra irie near Athol, Idaho in  Kootenai County. The average a nnua l precipita tion is about 22 inches with  only about I inch coming during the cri tical months or June, July, August , and  September. The soil is deri ved from sa ndy and gravelly glacia l oUlwash  composed ma inly of grani te, schi st, slate, and quartzite. The texture of the  surface soi l is a gravelly sandly loam with a pH of about 6.1.  Field trea tments (T able 2) were a pplied in a ra ndomized comp lete block  design. E.ach treatment consisted of 100 2-1 seedlings which were root-pruned  to 9 inches prior to treatment in the field with growth substa nces. Seedlings  were planted in early April , 1967, about one week a ft er the planting si te had  been plowed . At weekly interva ls, beginni ng on April 15 and continuing unti l  July 12 , the tota l number or broken buds per seed ling was counted.

""Vide va riation in percent bud break among  seedlings within a given treatment was noted . For eXJ.mple, two seedlings in  treatment A had no broken buds after one month while another ~eed ling in the  same treatment had 100 percent broken buds. There was less variation in bud  break among seedlings in the control group. Results of this experiment  demonstrated the large inherent differences in sensi tivit y of indi vidual seedlings  to plant growth substances.  Shoot growth after one month was signi fi ca ntly reduced by the :vlH  treatments (T able 3). Shorter shoots .on seedlings treated wi th MH are  probably the result of two factors. Fi rst , since bud break was delayed , the  shoots of :VI H treated pla nts grew for a shorter period than did shoots of control  planlS. Secondl y, Greulach a nd Haesloop (1954) reported that :vi R not only  delays bud break but also inhibits elongation of in ternodes.  All three YlH concentrat ions were detrimental to root growth (Tab le 3).  Actua ll y, in most cases, there was no new root growth at a ll on YlH treated  plants. In comparison , the control seed lings showed, on the average,  considerably greater root grow th . It seems likely that MH was transported to  the root system where it adversely affected both root in itiat ion a nd growth .  Crafts ( 196 1) has demonstrated that radioacti ve ly labeled NIH applied to the  tops of barley pla nts would accumulate in the roots. The mecha ni sm by which  YlH interferred with root growth is not known . However, Pilet ( 1957) found  that high concentrations 01 .\1H 1_1 0-3 'vI) increased the acti vi ty 01 lAA­ox  idase, an enzyme which destroys IAA in Lens culinaris. Thus , ylH may be  reducing the level of endogenous auxin to a growth li miting level.  Although the inhi bit ion of top growth by :vlH was the desired resu lt, the  inhibition of root growth was unsatisfactory. The two higher concemrations of  :vIH a lso produced some chlorosis and necrotic spotting at the needle tips.  It was decided , therefore, to reduce the :vi H concemration to 1000 ppm and  the length of the top-soak period to 15 minutes in the next experiment. In  addition , roots were soaked in auxin solutions in the hope of counteracting  the rlet rimenta l effect of M H on root growth .  5  Table 3.

After one month signifi ca ntly fewer buds had opened on seed lings treated with  ~1 H as compa red to seedlings in the two con trol treatments (E AND f ).  However, by the end of the second month only treatment 0 had significantly  fewer broken buds. Thus, the effect of MH on bud break , under the conditions  of this experiment, was (0 genera lly delay, rather than completely inhibit  opening. As far as ShOOl growth was concerned , a ll groups of seedlings treated  with MH, with the exception of treatment B, produced significantl y shorter new  shoots than did seedlings in the two control treatments.  ~1 a le i c hydrazide, when a pplied a lone (treatment A), reduced root growth  but not nearly to the extent as in the first experiment. There are several reasons  for thi s. First, duration of the top-soak was on ly fifteen minutes in the second  experiment rather than one hour, so less MH was a bsorbed . Also, root-pruning  was less severe and the roots had an extra month to grow in this experiment. It  is a lso probable that the mixture of sa nd , pea t, a nd soil was a more favorable  rooting medium than sa nd a lone. In three or the I'our trea tments where MH  was used, the number of roots with new growth greater than 0.5 inch was  great l), reduced from that of control seedlings (T able 4). However, treatment B,  which emplo)'ed a root-soak in I ppm IBA and 10 ppm IAA in combination  with the top-soak in MH, produced an average of 100 such roots, the highest  number of any treatment. There was no signifi ca nt difference for this  pa rameter of root growth among treat ment B and the two controls, indicating  that the negati ve effect of MH on the regenerating potentia l of the root system  had been elimina ted . The average length of the longest new root ranged from  5.3 to 8.1 inches (T able 4). The two control treatments produced the longest  roots, but becuase of wide va riation within treatments, no significa nt differences  were indica ted.  It was noted that the top-growth of the control group a nd the group treated'  with the solvent for MH was slightly more vigorous than that of other groups of  seedlings . A subjective rating of seedling vigor gave the former two groups a  rating of 4.0 out of a best possible score of 5.0. The average vigor of the latter  groups of seedl ings , a ll of which had been treated with MH, ra nged from 3.4 to  3.9. The mai n reason for the lower rating was the deve lopment of a slight  chlorosis on the older needles.  The green house experiments showed tha t top growth of Douglas fir  seedlings cou ld be reduced temporarily without signigica ntl y a ffecting root  growth if the proper combinat ion 01' MH a nd a uxins was employed . Under  the conditions of the greenhouse ex periments in this stud y, the proper com­binat  ion was 1000 ppm M H for the top-soak solution and a mixture of I ppm  [BA a nd 10 ppm IAA for the root-soak solution . It was decided to evaluate  the effects of this treatment, a long with severa l others, on the survi val of  field pla nted seedlings. One of the field treatments (C) had gibberellic acid  included in the root-soak because Brian and Hemming (1957) postulated  that MH inhibits the action of a ""gibberellin-like"" hormone in dwarf pea  pla nts.  The summer of 1967 in northern Idaho was one of the hott est and driest on  record . Daily air tempera tures in excess of 100 degrees F a nd rela tive humidity  readings of about 10 percent were common from la te June to the midd le of  September.

Thus, it was an ideal situation  for test ing the effects of the growth substance treatments on increasing drought  resistance of planted seedlings.  During the early pan of the summer the only seedling mortality was cuased  by the nonhern pocket gopher, Thom omys talpoideL and the Columbian  ground squirrel , CitelLus columbianu.1'. A total of 35 seedlings of the 500 pla nts  were destro yed by these animals. Afte r J une there was no fu rther loss to this  source, probably because forbs and grasses had become abundant on the  planting site by that time.  Fig. 1 graphi ca lly depicts survival percentages of seedlings from the  various treatments. On August 2, seedling survival exceeded 95 percent  regardless of treatment. During the early weeks of August, seedli ng survival  in treatments A, B, and D ranged from 10 to 20 percent higher than that of  the contro l. The relatively lower surviva l rate for the control during early  August was actually treatments A and D still exhibited surviva l rates higher  than that of the control. However , beca use of the wide va ri ation among  replications within treatments, these differences were not significant. By  September 26 only trea tment D seedlings had a higher survival rate than  the control seedl ings. The final survival count was taken on October 10,  at which time survival ranged from a low of 0.0 percent for treatment C to  a high of 16.5 percent for trea tment D.  100  90  "" III  «~ 70  &gt; ;; 60  ~  ~  ~ 50  'z""  c~ &lt;00  t:j  ~ JO  1Il  10  0 ABC DE  Aug. 2  Fig. I.

UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO lIBRARV  Although final survival rates were extremely poor in all treatments. it is  noteworthy that. for most of the season, treatments A and D produced the most  favorable result s. Treatment A had also yielded the most favorable results in  the greenhouse. Treatment D had the same root-soak solution (I ppm IBA and  10 ppm IAA) as treatment A, but the top-soak solution was cut to only 10 ppm  ~'lH . At this low concentration . there was no significa nt inhibition of bud break  (Fig. 2) , although the rate of bud break was significa ntly reduced in the three  treatments where 1000 ppm MH was used. For example, on May 28 •. only  39.S, 33.2 , 3 1.4 percent of the buds in treatments A, B, and C had opened ,  whereas 90.1 and M 1.7 percent had opened in treatment LJ and the control.  Uespite the fact that 1 U ppm MH did not detay bud' break, the auxin  combination used in 'the root soak solution may have stimulated root growth.  thereby increasing the abi lity of seedlings to survive.  The length of the longest new shoot on each seedling was measured on June  21. This parameter of shoot growth averaged from .80 to .85 inches for  treatment D and the control , respectivel y. The latter two treatments did not  significa ntly differ from each other , but were significantly longer than the  former three treatments. Thus, the field results supported findings from  greenhouse experiments that NIH concentrations of 1000 ppm dela y and inhibit  bud break of Douglas fir seedlings, as well as suppress shoot growth.

However, it is doubtful that any type of treatment , excluding irrigation,  would have greatly increased seedling surviva l rates during this extremely  dry summer. Treatments A and D perhaps would have increased survival  ra tes under modera tely droughty conditions, since for much of the growing  season their surviva l ra tes were higher than that of the control seedlings .  SUMMARY  T he effects of MH, a pla nt growth inhibitor, a nd two auxins (l BA and IAA)  on growth a nd survival of Douglas [ir seedlings were exami ned in greenhouse  and fie ld experiments. In the first greenhouse experiment , it was found that top­soaking  seedlings for one hour in concentra tions of 1000 to 5000 ppm MH  would inhibit budbre~k and shoot growth. However, root growth was a lso  seriously curtailed and seedling vigor declined .  An attempt was made in the second greenhouse experiment to overcome  these negative effects of MH on root growth and vigor by utilizing a shorter  soaking period a nd by supplementing the MH treatment with a rool-soak in  certain a uxin solutions. MH at a concentration of 1000 ppm was still effective  in delaying bud break and reducing shoot growth , even after the roots were  soaked in auxin solutions. Furthermore , a root-soak in a combination of I ppm  ISA a nd 10 ppm IAA prevented the reduct ion in root growth ca used by MH in  other trea tments.  Theoreti ca ll y a reduction in top-growth coupled wi th an adequate root  system shou ld provide seedlings with greater abi lity to withstand drought.  ·i ·his hypotheses was tested with a fi eld experiment a t Atho l, Idaho, in 1967. As  in the greenhouse, bud break was suppressed by top-t reatment with 1000 ppm  MH. The effects of the root-soak treatments on root growth of fi eld planted  seedlings is not known. However, in those treatments where a combinat ion of 1  ppm IBA a nd 10 ppm IAA were used, surviva l rates of seedlings for much ofthe  growing season ' vere higher than that of control seed lings. The growing season  in 1967 in northern Idaho was so severe that it is unli kely that any growth  substance treatment could have signifi ca ntly increased survival of planted  seedlin gs. Further study will be required to determine if a lterations in the  seedling's growth pattern with plant growth substa nces would be beneficial for  survival.  11  LITERATURE CITED  Bria n, P.

The work included the  intraecotypic pollinations of lO-tree diallel crosses; interecotypic pollina­tion  between Arizona, Oregon, and the local Idaho ecotypes; and selfing  experiments.  POLLINATION PROCEDURE  Fresh pollen was used in controlled pollinations with the exception of  a few occasions in interecotypic crosses. The pollen was collected by  forcing nearly matured male strobili 5 to 10 days before natural pollen  shedding. The pollen was extracted, screened, and stored at about 40° F.  in a desiccator unti l used.  Female flowers were isolated by using transparent sausage casi ng bags.  The reusable, nonwoven plastic pollination bag, with or wi thout wi ndows,  also was tried with equal success. The inside temperature of the reusable  type is probably lower than the sausage casing but the sausage casing  is more visible and considerably cheaper than the former.  The isolated flowers were dusted with pollen using a syringe pollinator.  The needle puncture on each isolation bag was sealed with masking tape  after pollination. One flower-bearing shoot was included in each bag.  The flowers developed into a cluster of cones after fertilization . Each  cluster on the average included two cones (Table III) but the number  varied from one to nine.  lThis study was supported in part by the Mcintire-Stennis Research Program,  and published with the approval of the Director of the Forest, Range and Wildlife  Experiment Station, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.

Female strobili  were generally found at the upper part of the crown.  4  FLOWERING OF PONDEROSA PINE  The time when female strobili became receptive for pollination fluctu­ated  from May 17 to June 6 during 1964-70. Roeser (1941) observed a  close synchronization of ponderosa pine flowering and the last spring  frost in Colorado. In northern Idaho, the beginning of pollen shedding  (Fig. 1) as a rule preceded the blooming of female flowers by about two  to five days. The time of flowering (Table I, Fig. 3) as indicated by the  number of days from the beginning of the year was found positively  correlated with the last spring frost of the year (r - 0.868).  Table I. Flowering of Ponderosa Pine.

(Day 1964·70 ).  A good seed crop always was associated with an ample pollen supply,  and ponderosa pine was most lavish in pollen production. The last good  cone year was 1958 in southern Idaho and at the height of the blooming  season, pollen was so abundant that views beyond one to two hundred  yards were obscured (Curtis 1962).  The size of male strobili varied considerably between trees, and seemed  to be a consistent individual tree character. About four to ten grams of  dry pollen could be extracted from one hundred male strobili (Table II).  Phenological observations of six natural stands of ponderosa pine  on open slopes and sheltered valleys within a range of 30 miles in  Latah County showed that the flowering date among trees within a stand  and bet wen stands varied less than two days. The female flowers re­mained  susceptive for about a week. The shedding of pollen continued  5  for several days depending on the weather, although the bulk of pollen  was depleted in a few hours on a w arm and w indy day. No evidence  of phenological breeding barriers were observed. However, there was  greater chance of genetic isolation by flow ering time between eleva­tions.  The ponderosa pine of Bald Mountain (5,500 ft.) blooms ten days  later than Idaho City (4,200 ft.) less than 20 miles apart.  Table II. Pollen Production of Ponderosa Pine.

INTRAECOTYPIC POLLINATION  In the intraecotypic pollination of ponderosa pine, a total of 22 trees  in six natural stands were used as seed trees and pollen sources. They  are natural ly regenerated trees of Latah County in northern Idaho. In the  four cone crops so far obtained, intraecotypic crosses produced 69.05  seeds per cone. This was nearly as many as those produced by wind  pollination in the same group of trees (Table III). For comparison, the  cumulative average of seeds per cone for controlled pollination in the  three pollination years, 1964, 1966 and 1967, was 69.75 and the average  seeds per cone produced in w ind pollination by the same group of trees  during the three-year period was 70.92.  About four to fi ve weeks after artificial pollination, when the isolation  bags were removed (Fig. 4), the fertilized strobili had developed into  succulent conelets, deep purplish red in color. The average survival of  the control pollinated cones at the time of harvest was 52.10 percent.  Destruction of matured cones was done mostly by squirrels shortly before  cone collection. The damage was especially serious in years of poor cone  crop such as in 1967 and 1968.  6  Table III. Cone and seed production in intraecotypic pollination of ponderosa pine.

INTERECOTYPIC POLLINATION AND THE EFFECT OF POLLEN STORAGE  In the interectotypic poll inations, pollen from Arizona (Flagstaff),  coastal Oregon (Corvall is), and eastern Oregon (Lost Forest) were used in  hybr idization with ponderosa pine of northern Idaho (Table IV). When  fresh pollen was used, interecotypic pollinations produced as many seeds  per cone as the intraecotypic crosses by the same seed trees in the same  crop year.  8  :cz::::  ~- ~ =&lt;  c:::;:,  ~ -c::J  ~  c=  3; ;=;  ~  ~~  •  Fig. 4.

One-year-old pollen produced about 20 percent less seed than freshly  collected pollen. The stored pollen was kept at about 40° F. in a desic­cator.  Pollen in storage for more than two years deteriorated consider­ably  under this condition.  INBREEDING, OUTCROSS, AND WIND-POLLINATION  In the three crop years self-pollination of ten seed trees (Table V)  produced on the average 66.40 well formed seeds per cone. This is ap­proximately  as many seeds as those produced in outcross (64.68) and  wind pollination (67.27) by the same mother trees in the three-year  period.  According to the study of ponderosa pine embryogeny by Bucholz and  Striemert (1946) the fertilization of embryo takes place nearly 12 months  after pollination. The year-old cones and the unfertilized seeds are a lready  fully grown in size but not yet hardened (Fig. 5). A seed in which fer­tilization  fails to take place remains as a full size empty seed in which  the stony seed coat may be as fully developed as in a sound seed.  A comparison between the self-pollinated and wind-pollinated seeds  of nine mother trees of the same crop year showed that the self-pollinat­ed  seeds are considerably lighter in weight and low er in germination ca­pacity.  The average 100-seed weight of self-pollinated seeds of the nine  mother trees is 4.14 grams and that of the wind-pollinated seed is 5.05  grams. This difference is statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01 ). A germina­tion  test including four of the above nine pairs of self-and wind-pollinated  seed samples are given in Table V I:  11  Table V.

The obvious low germination capacity of the wind-pollinated  seed in comparison with ordinary commercial sources of ponderosa pine  seed essentially was caused by the nature of the test materials. In this  study every well-developed seed from the self-pollinated, as well as the  wind-pollinated cones, w as extracted. This included those in the lower  part of the cone which were possibly low in viability and not extractable  by ordinary means of tumbling. Seedlings of self-pollination origin were  also low in first-year survival.  UNIVERSITY OF DAHO UBR~RY  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  The flowering of ponderosa pine during 1964-70 was found positively  correlated with the last spring frost (r - 0 .868).  The differences in flowering time of a year in the six natural stands  of Latah County were not more than two days. This condition permitted  panmictic pollination in the natural population. But between different  elevations the differences were found to be great enough to become  effective phenological breeding barriers.  On the basis of seed count of well-formed seeds, there were as many  seeds per cone produced in controlled pollination as in wind pollination.  Self-pollinated seeds were lighter in weight and lower in germination ca­pacity  than wind pollinated seeds.  In both the control-pollinated and wind-pollinated seed the well-formed  seeds may be full , empty or half-full with embryos and endosperms in  various degrees of development. The differences in seed development  may be caused by genetic incompatibility. In controlled pollination of  local trees the pollen was from a specific male parent, while in wind pol­lination,  the pollen was probably from several adjacent trees. The differ­ences  in seed development and germination capaci ty between the con­trolled  pollination and wind pollination reflect the possible differences in  compatibility between the specific parents. In a seed orchard the seed  production is from the restricted pollination of a limited number of select­ed  parents. In light of the present study the compatibility between the  individual parents should be included as a criterion for selection of the  breeding materials.  14  LITERATURE CITED  Bucholz, J.

Two north­ern  Idaho plantations served as experimental sites, observations  in each being made over a six·year growing period. Because seed­ling  survival was poor on one of the sites, actual data presented  are from a single plantation. Similar trends, however, appeared  to be equally evident at the second location.  Based on the work reported here, only three strains of Scotch  pine can be unreservedly recommended to Idaho growers. These  are: ( I ) Spanish Burgos (preferred ), (2) Spanish Segovia, and  (3) Polish Riga. A minimum of cultural operations are required  to produce quality Christmas trees from these strains. Two French  strains, although better than the average, were rated below the  three strains listed. Mainly because of excessive growth rates,  the cost of developing acceptable trees from many of the other  strains investigated makes their selection unwise.  Future seedings of Scotch pine at the University of Idaho  Clarke McNary Nursery will be of the Spanish Burgos strain ex­clusively.  ji"" .

Loewenste in and F. H. Pitkin2  INTRODUCfION  Production and marketing of Christmas trees from northern Idaho  have rapidly expanded in recent years. Most of the trees involved have  been 'wild,' i.e., they have been cut from the native forest. As in other  parts of the country, this pattern is gradually shifting to a plantation  type of operation.  Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris) has become by far the leading species  of Christmas tree sold in the United States, accounting for almost  30% of the market. Scotch pine is not yet grown extensively in Idaho,  but consumer demand makes it likely that large acreages will be de­voted  to this species as more and more plantations are established  within the state.  The seed source utilized is of tremendous importance when Scotch  pine is to be planted. Trees grown from seed of one source may be  excellent specimens at harvest time; those grown from a second source  may have such poor form and color as to be unmarketable. Those  grown from one source may need a minimum of cultural treatment;  those from a second may require economica lly unfeasible effort to pro­duce  saJeable trees. Complicating the choice of seed source is the fact  that seed from a source proved superior in one geographic area may  produce inferior Christmas trees when used in another locali ty.  The work reported below was undertaken to find a seed source or  sources that would produce high quality Christmas trees with little  or no cultural operations under environmental conditions generally  prevailing in northern Idaho.  METHODS  Seed from 14 geographic varieties (proveniences) of Scotch pine  were obtained from commercial dealers in 1959 (Table 1 ). These seeds  were sown at the nursery ,and the resulting seedlings were raised in  the beds for two years. The two-year-olcl seedl ings were field planted  at hvo locations in northern Idaho during the spring of 1962. One site  was located on a terrace bordering the south side of the Clearwater  River about 10 miles west of Orofin o.

Soil in the planting  area has silt loam texture and a Ph of 6.0. The second plot was located  within the Rathdrum prairie, about 15 miles northwest of Coeur d'Alene.  During the course of the study the most intensive observations were  made on the Clearwater River site. The results enumerated in this paper,  therefore, are based on data collected from that particular area. Exami­nations  of the Hathdrum Prairie site indicated that trends established  on the main study area were equally evident there.  Table 1. Sources of Scotch Pine seed used in the experiment.

Both areas were clean cultivated prior  to the planting operation. Supplemental irrigation and periodic weed  control during the year of establishment enhanced survival on the Clear­water  site. These operations could not be performed on the Rathdrum  plot, and as a consequence seedling survival was relatively poor.  In an effort to stimulate survival and earl y growth, a fertilizer pellet  (composition-24% nitrogen, 2.6% phosphorus ) was placed in the plant­ing  hole of the first 13 seedlings of each 25 tree replicate.  During the summer of 1964, cu ltural treatments were initiated.  Operations included leader pruning, basal pruning, and shearing of lat­erals  for form improvement. These treatments were applied to 9 of the  14 proveniences involved in the study, being judged unnecessary on  the remaining 5, (except for pruning to a sa tisfactory basal whorl ).  In order to ascertain the effect of time of cul tural treatment on subse­quent  development, half the trees within the varieties involved were  treated on July I, whi le the remainder were treated late in th e growing  5  season, on August 29, Two trees within each replicate received no  treatment, serving as controls,  In 1965 it became necessary to shear individuals of the five sources  which were not involved in the 1964 cultural operations. Additionally,  the trees of the other nine varie ties again required cultural treatments  (same as pattern in 1964). In 1965, all cultural operations were per­form  ed on July 8.  Data concerning growth and quality fa ctors were obtained yearly  from 1962, the year of planting, through 1966. After measurements  and eva luations were made in the fall of the latter year, selected whole·  sale buyers were allowed to mark and remove trees from the experi­mental  site, In order to determine buyer preference, a record of each  tree so removed was maintained.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Fertilization  The placement of fertilizer pellets in the planting holes had no appar­ent  benefi cial effects. Survival of non-fertilized seedlings equalled that  of treated specimens. Height measurements made after the first and  subsequent growing seasons fa iled to reveal any stimulation resulting  from the fertilization treatment. Analyses of foliage for nutrient con­tent,  carried out after the first growing season, showed that fertilized  and unfertilized tissue did not differ Significantly in percentage of nitro­gen,  phosphorus, or potassium. It should also be stressed that no im­provement  in foliar color resulted from use of the fertilizer pellets.  Lack of response to fertilizer was experienced in this experiment  on both the Hathdrum ( unirrigated) and Clearwater ( irrigated ) plots.  The negative results obtained on the latter site are particularly worthy  of note. If beneficial effects cannot be obtained in situations where  soil moisture conditions are excellent, it is doubtful whether a grower  can expect any response where suppl emental applications of water are  not feasibl e. Scotch pine is a species which is generally believed to  have low requirements for nutrients, and based on results of this study  the particular seed source involved is not a fa ctor which affects these  requirements.  Christmas tree farmers sometimes find that their Scotch pine seed·  lings produce foliage of an undesira ble pale green or yellowish green  color. From experience with farm crops or certain other tree species  they quite logically believe that fertilization, especially with nitrogen,  will deepen the needle color.  Unfortunately, however, foliage color of Scotch pine is largely a  genetic character. Only in rare situations on extremely poor soils will  fertilization intensify the greenness of needles. The best answer to the  color problem lies in the proper choice of seed source for the plantation.  Further discussion of this point will be found in the section of this  paper entitled Color.  6  Height Growth  Many characteristics of Scotch pine vary with seed SOlUce. None  of these variations, perhaps, are more striking than the variation associ­ated  with height growth. Rapidity of height growth can be controlled  by cultural practices, such as tip pruning. However, lise of an in ­herentl  y slow-growing variety of pine will reduce the necessity of such  operations, thus concurrently reducing costs. Then too, certain cultural  techniques may result in undesirable ""bird-nests"" on upper whorls be­cause  an excessive number of buds develop into lateral branches. ~1ore  comment on this factor will be found in a later section.  Average height of trees on the Clearwater site which never received  cultural treatments and those which did is shown graphica lly in Figure  1. Data were collected in the fall of 1966 and thus represent five  years of growth.  Cultural operations produced trees ranging in average height from  76 inches for the Polish strain 1 source down to 62.5 inches for the  specimens grown from seed obtained in Canada. Comparison with  trees of each source which were untreated were quite revealing. Control  trees from the Polish Strain 1 source average 115 inches in height, for  example, and those developed from Canadian seed, 93.5 inches. Such  specimens were elongating at a much too rapid pace (more than 2 feet  per year in some instan ces) for Christmas tree purposes. In contrast,  control trees of certain other races (e.g. Spanish Segovia and Burgos,  Riga) were not appreciably taller (or were even shorter ) than speci­mens  which were cultured. As a general rule, th e strains which Fi gure 1  indicates had appreciable differences in height of control and cultured  specimens should not be chosen as Christn'las tree growin g stock.  Highest cost would be involved in managing these, and even though  height growth was retarded, the quality of the final product could well  be unsatisfactory.  Little variation was noted in the growth ra te within a strain during  the entire course of the experiment. Control trees which were tallest in  1966 had in each of the previous years consistently maintained growth  rates high enough to damage form. On the other hand, control trees  which were relatively short in 1966 had at no time previously exhibited  an excessively high growth rate.  Density  Consumer preference has generally been for Scotch pine specimens  exhibiting a marked degree of foliar density. Such a condition may be  brought about by shearing, an operation which will stimulate branch­ing  and subsequent needle production. The strain of pine used, how­ever,  is also reflected in the foliar development. One seed source may  produce trees with a much more dense, compact branching habit than  another, thus markedly reducing the necessity to shear. Such differ­ences  were noted with the varieties examined in this study, as detailed  below.  7  , 1  III 1111111111111 1111 1111111l  AUS TR lA, 1000'-1600'  IT fTIT1T  AUSTRIA, 330d-400C  11111 I III III II II II  I BELGIUM, STRAIN I  nllllllllllllli 11111111 IITIT  I BELGIUM, STRAIN 2  11111111111 I111 III  I CANADA  1111 lilT ITTT ITTT II ITTT  I CZECH  1111111111 III II  I FRANCE, STRAIN I  11111111 11111111 II  r FRANCE, STRAIN 2  11111111111 11111l1l m ITTTITTT n  I POLAND, STRAIN I  11I1 I11I1111 11111111 III  POLAND, E.

Treat·  ment of the Spanish, French, and Polish Riga strains was minimal a nd oc­curred  only in 1965; cultural treatment of the others was intensive and oc­curred  both in 1964 and 1965.  9  Foliage density was estimated on the basis of sparse, medium, or  full, these being given numerical values of 3, 2, and 1 respectively for  averaging purposes. The same two observers, working as a team, made  all of the density estimations.  Four strains (Austria, 1,000'- 1,600', Poland Strain 1, East Prussia,  and Scotland ) were represented by control trees with density rating'  of 3 ( Figure 2 ). In all four instances cultural activities, primaril y shear­ing  of laterals, improved density ratings to at least 2.  The trees from many of the other proveniences, however, bore aCM  ceptably dense foliage on controls. The two Spanish strains, Burgos and  Segovia, and one Belgium source were particularl y outstanding in this  regard. Shearing operations required were minimal with these three  strains.  Some change was noted in density ratings of control trees between  evaluations made in 1963 and 1966. For exampl e, the Austria 1,000'--  1,600' strain had a foliar density of 1 ( full ) in 1963, but for controls  this rating had fall en to 3 (sparse) by 1966. This deterioration in qual­ity  is clearly correlated with the high annual height growth rate of  trees from this source, this factor resulting in long internodes between  whorls of branches.  Thus the state of foliar density two or three years after planting  is unreliable as an indicator of the amount of cul ture work which will  be necessary to produce trees with satisfactory foliar density at harvest  time. Strains with inherently rapid growth rates should be avoided,  regardless of earl y appearance.  Needle Length  Considerable genetic variation is found in the length of needles pro­duced  by Scotch pUle. As consumers have been found to generally  prefer trees bearing relati vely short needles, the grower must be con­cerned  with this factor when selecting a particular strain for his planta­tion.  Figure 3 graphically presents comparisons of needle length of  the fourte~n varieties involved, as observed on ( 1) foliage developed  during the year of harvest (1966) , and (2) foliage developed and  measured in 1963. Because needle length did not seem to be affected  by cultural treatment, data from controls are not plotted. In 1966,  needle length ranged from 1.45 inches for the seed source from an ele­vation  of 3,300-4,000 feet in Austria, up to 2.1 inches for the source ob ·  tained from East Prussia. It would appear from these results that little  practical difference exists in the needle length of any of the proveniences  examined. However, a consideration of the 1963 measurements indi­cates  otherwise. Here differences between sources are much greater,  suggesting that the effect of variation in cl imate or other envi ronmental  factors may be refl ected to a greater degree in one race than in another.  For example, one Belgium strain produced needles averaging 2.85 inches  long in 1963, compared to 2.05 inches in 1966. On the other hand,  the Biga source showed almost no diffe rence in length of needles pro­duced  during the two years.  10  ,  AUSTRIA, 1000'- 1600'  I AUSTRIA, 3300'-4000'  IIII II ill  I BE LGIUM , STRAIN I  Ulli III III III  I BELGIUM, STRAIN 2  II III III III II I II  I CANADA  I CZECH  I I I I I III I I II  FRANCE, STRAIN I  II I I I IIII II  FRANCE, STRAIN 2  Lll i III I I I I II  I POLAND, STRAIN I  I II  POLAND , E.

On the basis of the work re­ported  here, the two French strains, th e one from Austria (3,300' -  4,000'), the Spanish Segovia and the Polish Higa strains appear good  choices. It must be remembered, however, that needle length is but  one factor in the complex of factors which affect the desirability of •  particular race.  Color  As mentioned earlier ( in the section concerning fertilization ). the  color of Scotch pine foliage is largely controlled by genetic traits, al­though  some climatic effects can also be noted. While an occasional  individual specimen will vary, most trees within a particular strain will  exhibit a similarity of needle coloration. Thlls certain strains will con­sistently  exhibit a yellowish appearance, making them unfit for Christ­mas  tree purposes unless an artificial colorant is utilized. This tech­nique,  of course, increases cost. Other strains may show poorer color  one year than another, under the influence of climate. In 1966, foliage  color was judged shortly before harvest, as acceptable coloration early  in the growing season does not necessarily mean acceptable coloration  later. Munsell Color Charts for Plant Tissue were used to aid in the  evaluation.  Color differences among the fourteen strains under observation were  quite small in 1966. No provenience investigated, therefore, would have  been eliminated from consideration on the basis of the color factor  alone. In other years, however, variation among the strains was more  marked with several exhibiting very pale coloration in the autumn. For­tunately,  the races which were judged best in other attributes involving  quality did not show this tendency to vary in color from year to year.  Cultural Techniques  In 1964 and again in 1965, leaders were pruned on trees represent­ing  nine of the races involved in the experiments. Because of their rela­tively  slow growth rates, the two Spanish, the two French, and the Higa  sources did not receive this treahnent.  Leader pruning generally proved detrimental to the quality of the  trees. This practice was used in an attempt to correct for the very rapid  growth of many strains, but two deleterious effects negated its value.  First of all, new leader growth developed from one of the numerous  adventitious buds which formed on the side of the old leader, below  the cut, and in most cases, a pronounced crook or 'dogleg' was pro­duced  as the new twig elongated and gradually turned upward. In an  attempt to ascertain if the angle of the cut made in pruning the original  leader would influence the tendency for crooks to form, several differ­ent  angles were utilized. On some specimens, the leader was severed  12  in a horizontal plane, on others it was cut on an angle of either 45° or  70° in reference to the horizontal. Some reduction of severity of crook­edness  was noted when the cut was made at the steep angle of 70°, but  the defect was still quite noticeable. Where the cut was made hori­zontall  y, double leaders frequently occurred.  A second negative effect on quality was also related to the adventi­tious  buds below the cut. These buds developed in such profusion that  upon their elongation into a whorl of lateral branches a pronounced  &lt;birds-nest' appearance was created. When treatment was made late in  the growing season there was some decrease in bud formation as com­pared  to results found when tips were pruned earlier, but appearance  was still unsatisfactory. Removal of many of the branches in these  whorls was necessary and on a commercial basis this operation would  add considerably to costs.  In contrast to tip pruning, basal pruning did not adversely affect the  form of the trees, and it is quite possible to reduce leader growth  through use of this latter technique. However, the amount of basal  pruning required to achjeve the goal is an important consideration.  With many of the strains investigated, it appeared that an inordinate  number of lower branches would have to be removed in order to retard  height growth enough to make tip pruning unnecessary. Such excessive  pruning would be unsatisfactory from the standpoints of both cost of  production and size of marketable trees. Here again, the superiority of  the re latively slow growing strains such as those from Spain becomes  evident.  Some shearing was judged to be unavoidable regardless of proven­ience.  The amount needed varied markedly between strains and to  some extent between individuals belonging to the same strain .  Most of the races required shearing in 1964 and again in 1965. In  many instances the practice was utilized to in crease the density of foli ­age.  In other situations the indi vidual had acceptable foliar density,  but shearing was needed to improve form . The natural denSity and  form of the Spanish, French, and Riga proveniences were such that  shearing was only executed in 1965.  Stem Form  The quality of Scotch pine Christmas trees is sometimes impaired by  stem crookedness, a factor which is often genetically controLled. The  stem form of trees involved in this study, however, was judged satisfac­tory  regardless of the particular provenience observed.  Grade  In the fall of 1966, shortly before harvest, all trees involved in the  experiment were graded by two evaluators working as a team. These  quality grades reflected the total impact of all the aspects of appear­ance  cited earlier in this paper. A grade of 1 represented a premium  or top quality Christmas tree, a grade of 2 an average but acceptable  13  specimen, while a grade of 3 indicated poor indi viduals which would  be difficult to market,  Control specimens from the different races showed wide variation  in grade. Those from certain strains (e,g, Poland Strain 1, Austria  1,000'-1,600', Scotland ) received the poor grade of 3, for example while  the two Spanish strains and the source from Higa produced controls  that had average grades of 1.5, This wide difference in grades was  greatly narrowed by treatment.  jf only the trees subjected to some degree of cultural treatment are  considered, the average grades ranged from 2 for the Canadian strain to  1.4 for the Spanish Segovia sou rce, It was thus possible to develop ac­ceptable  or better products from the great majority of these Scotch  pine, regardless of specific seed source. Practical considerations, how­ever,  rule out the use of most of the proveniences examined. First,  with many of the strains, rather drastic tip pruning was necessary to  reduce growth rate. This alone would be a costly JJrQcedure. Secondly,  as emphasized earlier, tip pruning resulted in un esirable side effects,  which cou ld only be corrected by considerably more cultural work.  On the basis of all factors involved then, only three of the fourteen  strains of Scotch pine tested can be highly recommended to Idaho  growers. These aTe listed in order of preference, as follows:  1. SPAIN, BUHGOS PHOVINCE. 3,000'-4,800' ELEVATION  2, SPAIN, SEGOVIA PHOVINCE, 3,500'-4,000' ELEVATION  3, POLAND HIGA STHAIN,  The two French strains also appeared satisfactory, but overall quality  of trees was judged to be under that of the sources listed above,  As a res ult of th e stuely reported here, the Clarke-McNary nursery  at the University of Idaho is now suppl ying Scotch pine seedlings of the  Spanish Burgos strain exclusively, Seed from all three of the preferred  sources are available from commercial seed dealers.  One furth er comment should be made. Some trees which normally  would be considered unmarketable may actually have considerable  value to particular wholesale buyers, This fact was observed at the con­clusion  of this experiment, when several wholesalers marked and har­vested  the crop according to their own desires, Most of the trees from  the superior strains Hsted above were taken. but so were a quantity of  the larger, less densely foliated specimens, some having relatively  poor form, The buyer planned to flock these, and with this treatment  they might well be attractive to certain consumers,  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO LIBBAI",,,2014-09-03,2018-11-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/fwres/id/104,104,193.pdf,/fwres/image/193.pdf,fwres104

The Mountain Whitefish: a Literature Review'  Milton K. Daily:!  Abstract  Mountain whitefish belong to the subfamily Coregoninae of the family  Salmonidae. They inhabit coldwater lakes and streams of the western  United States and Canada. They feed primarily on aquatic insect larvae,  and diet varies seasonally and with age. Mountain whitefish reach a max­imum  size of 22 inches and 6 Ibs., and a maximum age of 18 years.  Age and growth depend upon productivity of the environment. Mountain  whitefish spawn in streams and lakes from October through December,  and females produce 5,300 to 6,900 eggs per pound of fish. Mountain  whitefish may compete with associated species for food and they prey on  eggs of other species. A variety of parasites infect them. Whitefish have  a potential for increased sport and commercial use.  Introduction  Workers have made detailed investigations of the taxonomy, distri­bution,  food habits, and age and growth of the mountain whitefish,  Prosopium williamsoni. They have neg lected other aspects of its life  history such as reproduction, early development, interspecific relationships  and behavior. In this paper I consolidated information which pertains to  mountain whitefish. ~,  ' :,.: .,  Description  The mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) has a trout-like ap­pearance,  but the large scales, weak teeth, and small mouth of mountain  whitefish distinguish the fish from trout and salmon (McAfee, 1966). It  occurs in coldwater lakes and streams of the western United States and  Canada, and may have the local common names of Rocky Mountain white­fish  and grayling (Carl, Clemens and Lindsey, 1967).  The mountain whitefish belongs to the family Salmonidae (Carl et ai,  1967 and Norden, 1961). Girard first described the species in 1856 from  the Deschutes River in Oregon. The subfamily Coregoninae includes the  mountain whitefish and other whitefish species and separates them from  the trouts and salmons. Members of Coregoninae differ from other Salm­on  ids by the presence of a well-ossified hypethmoid bone and a lack of  teeth on the maxillae at any stage in life (Norden, 1961). The genera  Prosopium, Coregonus, and Stenodus comprise the subfamily Coregoninae.  Prosopium differs from the other two genera by having a single flap of  flesh between nostrils (two in Coregonus and Stenodus), an ossified basi­branchial  plate superimposed over the median basibranchia l bones, and  parr marks on the juveniles. Prosopium includes six species: cylindraceum,  williamsoni, spilonotus, abyssicola, coulteri, and gemmiferum.

The  others all live in western North America and P. coulteri also occurs in  Lake Superior (Norden, 1961). P. w illiamsoni was judged to be the least  modified and to possess characteristics intermediate in the genus (Norden,  1970).  The following characteristics distinguish P. williamsoni from other spe­cies,  body troutlike; length up to about one foot, occasionally to 22 inches  and 4 Ibs.; mouth small with no teeth; snout long, pointed, and upturned  in some individuals; gill rakers 20 to 26, short and thick; scales in 74 to  90 oblique rOWSi peduncle narrow, with 20 to 23 horizontal scale rows  crossing a line around its narrowest part; dorsal fin with 11 to 14 rays;  anal fin with 10 to 13 rays; adipose fine very large, its base more than  1V:2 times the eye diameter (except in very young fish)i general color  silvery, sometimes with a dark-bronze backi no spots on the adiposei  no dark spots on the head (or, rarely, a very few); young, up to about  4 inches, with a row of about 9 large, discrete, dark brown parr marks  along the lateral line, plus 1 or 2 rows of distinct smaller marks above  them (Car l et ai, 1967).  Distribution  The mountain whitefish has a wide distribution in the western United  States and Canada. It occurs from the west slope of the Rocky Mountains  to the Pacific Ocean from northern British Columbia to Utah (Jordan and  Evermann, 1905). The fish does not live in the interior of the Great Basin,  but occurs on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada  south to Upper and Lower Twin Lakes and the Walker River system (Mc­Afee,  1966). Mountain whitefish exist on the east slope of the Rocky  Mountains in the Liard, Peace, Athabaska, and Saskatchewan Rivers of  Canada and in the Missouri River drainage in Montana (Brown, 1952, and  Carl et ai, 1967). They have a wide distribution in the Columbia and Snake  River systems of the northwest United States (Godfrey, 1955; Lindsey,  1957; and Sigler, 1951), and occur in all major drainage systems of  British Columbia except the Yukon.  Habitat Preference  Streams  Sigler (1951) and Gerstung, according to McAfee (1966), reported that  adult mountain whitefish prefer pool and meadow areas of cool streams  w here water depths exceed three feet. Sigler found in Logan River, Utah,  that streams which measured less than 16 feet maximum width and 4 feet  maximum depth at least flow lacked w hitefish. He believed that less  water does not provide acceptable cover. Brown (1952) found in Montana  that most of the cold val ley streams contained mountain whitefish but  small mountain tributaries did not, as a rule. In his work on early develop­ment  of whitefish in the West Gallatin and Yellowstone Rivers, Brown  noted changes in habitat preference with size. He found sac fry along the  shore in two to six inches of water in small, well protected pockets cre­ated  by rubble or boulders, and in all backwaters which connected to the  4  main streams. Fry in the Yellowstone River remained in this type of water  from time of emergence in March until they reached a length of about  55 mm in late July. At that time they deserted the shallow shore waters.  Brown could not locate them by seining. He located fingerling-size white­fish  in October in deep pools of the main river. They averaged about 120  mm in length at that time. He aged them as young of the year. Finger­lings  from the West Gallatin River had deserted the shore areas by mid  June. Brown did not locate them again until early November when he  collected them from deep pools. They average 94.5 mm total length  at that time.  Mountain whitefish require cool water. Sigler (1951) and LaRivers  (1962) bel ieved that high water temperatures limit mountain whitefish  to elevations above 4,500 feet in California, Nevada, and Utah. No one  has measured their exact temperature tolerances.  The adequacy of a stream as whitefish habitat depends on the food  production in the stream. Mountain whitefish occur most abundantly in  streams where sufficient riffle areas provide an abundance of food. They  depend primarily on aquatic insect larvae (Sigler, 1951).  Lakes  Not all authors agree on habitat preferences of mountain whitefish in  lakes. Jordan and Evermann (1905) stated that they thrive in cold, oligo­trophic  lakes. However Godfrey (1955) found that mountain whitefish  occur most abundantly in eutrophic lakes with a fairly good supply of  bottom food organisms. Some diversity of findings also exists concerning  depth preferences in lakes. In summer sampling with gill nets of fish  populations in Babine and Lakelse Lakes, British Columbia, Godfrey caugh t  the greatest numbers of mountain whitefish at depths of 0 to 3 meters.  Below that depth zone the catches dropped off sharply. He caught no  whitefish at depths greater than 25 meters in Babine Lake and 12 meters  in Lakelse Lake. However Echo (1954) obtained different results in gill net  sampling of Lower Thompson Lake, Montana. He took the largest numbers  at lesser depths, and found that this depth distribution pattern continued  throughout March-August. However he did catch greater numbers at shal­lower  depths as summer progressed. Jordan and Evermann (1905) stated  that lake-dwelling mountain whitefish usually remained in deep water  until spawning season.  We may explain differences in depth preferences of lake-dwelling  mountain whitefish by examining productivity and food availability in  lakes. Carl et al (1967) and McHugh (1940) stated that mountain white­fish  feed primari ly on the bottom but that the diet varies considerably  with loca lity and in waters with poor bottom food production, the fish  may feed at any level, including the surface.  5  Food Habits  Several workers have studied the food habits of mountain whitefish .  McHugh (1940) made an extensive study of food habits of various age  classes of mountain whitefish in lakes and rivers of southern British  Columbia and Alberta. He found that whitefish in their first year of life  feed almost entirely at the bottom, only occasionally feeding on swim­ming  or floating organisms. Food of first-year fish consisted almost ex­clusively  of aquatic insects. Pupae of Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera  nymphs predominated. Cladocera and other free-swimming aquatics ap­peared  occasionally and terrestrial forms rarely.  In mountain whitefish aged two years and older, McHugh found that  food habits varied more and depended more upon availability and en­vironmental  conditions than in one-year fish. However, the bottom feeding  habit still persisted. larvae and pupae of Chironomidae and other aquatic  Diptera occurred most commonly in the diet. larval Ephemeroptera and  Trichoptera appeared next in importance, followed by Gastropoda. Free  swimming, floating, or flying organisms, such as Cladocera and terrestrial  insects appeared less frequently but in quantity rarely. Food habits varied  with locality, age, and season.  The most pronounced variation in food habits with locality occurred  between lakes and rivers. larval Diptera and Cladocera dominated the  mountain whitefish diet in lakes. Cladocera appeared more frequently in  lakes which contained a sparse bottom fauna. Also whitefish fed exten­sively  on terrestrial insects occasionally in these lakes. The diet varied  much more in streams than in lakes. Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera  nymphs and Trichoptera larvae appeared as typical forms in stream-dwell­ing  fish, which also ate a great variety of free-swimming, terrestrial or  aerial organisms. Fish may have taken the latter forms anywhere between  the bottom and the surface.  McHugh also discovered variations in food habits with size. Young fish  fed chiefly on small individuals such as Diptera larvae and entomostraca.  Small organisms occurred in smaller proportions as age of fish increased.  Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera nymphs, Trichoptera larvae and terrestrial  insects appeared in greatest volume in fish of intermediate age whereas  larger forms such as Gastropoda appeared in largest quantities in the  oldest whitefish.  McHugh also noted seasonal variations in food habits. From January  to March whitefish ate aquatic insect larvae almost exclusively. From  April to June additional organisms such as Cladocera, fish and terrestrial  insects appeared in the diet. During July to September the diet varied  most. The fish consumed aquatic insects frequently at this time but ter­restrials,  Cladocera, and other seasonal forms also appeared in consid­erable  numbers. McHugh examined ripening fish in December and found  l ittle or no food in their stomachs. This suggests restricted feeding toward  spawning time.  6  Clemens, Rawson and McHugh (1939) found that mountain whitefish  ate more Cladocera than aquatic insect larvae and other forms, in lakes  of the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia. They found that older fish  depended primarily on water fleas and copepods for their main food  supply, and ate lesser amounts of aquatic insect larvae from the lake  bottom. Rawson and Elsey (1950) obtained similar findings from their  study of the summer food habits of mountain whitefish in Pyramid lake,  Alberta. In Pyramid Lake Cladocera made up 29% of the diet by volume.  The fish consumed lesser volumes of caddis larvae, mayfly nymphs and  adults, Gammarus, and Chironomidae larvae and adults. Both Clemens  et al (1939) and Rawson and Elsey (1950) believed that mountain  whitefish ate a variety of prey species because of the poor bottom fauna  of the lakes.  Godfrey (1955), Chapman and Quistorfl (1938), Carl et al (1967),  Jeppson (1959), Kemmerer, Bovard and Boorman (1924), Laakso (1951),  Sigler (1951) all reported that the diet of mountain whitefish consists  primarily of aquatic insects.  Laakso (1951) conducted one of the most extensive food habits studies  on mountain whitefish. He investigated whitefish in streams in Montana  where he compared food habits of fingerling and adult fish and analyzed  seasonal variations in diet. He examined fingerlings of 1 v.. to 2 inches  average total length in June and July and found that they depended on  aquatic insects for food. The fingerlings fed principally on midge lar­vae  but also took small numbers of adult Chironomidae. Ephemeroptera  nymphs, immature stoneflies and caddis larvae also appeared in important  numbers in the diet. Adult whi tefish also depended on aquatic insect  larvae but ate larger forms such as caddis larvae and stonefly nymphs.  Some variation in proportions of different aquatic insects in the diet oc­curred  among the streams which Laakso sampled. In general Laakso  found no important differences in the kinds of organisms which whitefish  of various lengths ate. But smaller fish ate smaller numbers and sizes of  prey.  In his comparison of whitefish diets at different seasons, Laakso found  that the fish ate caddis larvae most in fall and winter. Plecoptera nymphs  appeared in abundance except in the fall. The diet contained significant  numbers of Ephemeroptera larvae in the spring and many Diptera larvae  throughout the year. Laakso compared the stomach contents of whitefish  with those of trout during winter. He found that whitefish usually had full  stomachs, even during the coldest part of the year. Whitefish contained  over five times as much food as did trout from December to February.  Items other than aquatic insects may comprise important portions of the  diet of mountain whitefish at certain seasons and localities. Jeppson (1959)  stated that in Lake Pend O'reille, Idaho, whitefish prey seriously on  kokanee eggs in shoal spawning areas during winter months. Laakso  (1951) found fish eggs in stomachs of Gallatin River fish. Snyder (1918)  stated that mountain whitefish prey on the eggs of spawning fish and  sometimes fill their stomachs with eggs of their own species. Foerster  7  (1925) listed whitefish along with trout and suckers as the most serious  marauders of the spawning beds of sockeye salmon. Munro and Clemens  (1937) reported one instance of a mountain whitefish taking a sculpin.  Few workers have studied the feeding behavior of mountain whitefish.  Sigler (1951) found that in the logan River they feed primarily at night  or twilight. He found that mountain whitefish normally feed on the bot­tom  but frequently come to the surface to feet at night. He stated that  they commonly feed at night in surface schools of 50 to 75 fish .  Age and Growth  Age and growth of mountain whitefi sh differs considerably among  habitat types. McHugh (1941) listed food and temperature as two im­portant  factors which affect growth rate of mountain whitefish. Whitefish  in rich, productive waters have rapid growth and low longevity whereas  fish from less productive waters experience slower growth and greater  longevity. McHugh compared growth of mountain whitefish in two dis­similar  Canadian lakes - Bow lake, Alberta and Cultus lake, British  Columbia. Bow lake lies at a higher elevation, remains colder, and pro­duces  less organic matter than Cultus Lake. Size of each age class of white­fish  differed significantly between the two waters (Table I). In an extreme  example, eight-year-old fi sh from Bow lake averaged 9.0 inches total  length compared to 16.8 inches for fish from Cultus lake. McHugh col­lected  whitefish with a maximum age of 17 years from Bow lake but  only 8 years from Cultus lake. Cultus Lake whitefish grew extremely  rapidly during the first two years of life.  Sigler (1951) found that whitefish in the logan River, Utah grew faster  than fish in most whitefish populations. However they still grew slower  than those in Cultus lake (Table I).  Jeppson (1959) stated that mountain whitefish in lake Pend O'reille  grow somewhat faster than the average for other lakes in the United  States. He estimated that fish in lake Pend O'reille grow about 3 inches  per year for the first 3 years, about 1 V2 inches per year during their fourth  and fifth years, and about 1 inch per year thereafter. However he stated  that they rarely exceed 16 inches in length or 1 lb. in weight.  In Table I I have summarized work by several authors on age and  growth. All of the workers lumped both sexes together to obtain their  data. Sigler (1951) stated that in the logan River, the sexes had quite  similar rates of growth. But McHugh (1941) stated that Coregonid fishes  generally exhibit a sexual difference in growth by weight.  Most authors did not use weight measurements in their work, but  Sigler used weights to obtain length-weight relationships for fish in the  Logan River. He found that weight increased almost exactly as the cube of  the length. Sigler derived the following relationship.  8  Log W - - 4.75778 + 2.98023 Log L  where:  L - standard length in millimeters  W = weight in grams  Sigler calculated condition factors for logan Ri ver whitefish by using  the following formula.  K - W X 10'  L'  where:  L - standard length in millimeters  W = weight in grams  K -- condition factor  He obtained an average condition factor of 1.572. Length and sex did not  influence the results although Sigler did no sampling during the spawn­ing  period.  Rawson and Elsey (1950) weighed mountain whitefish from Pyramid  Lake, Alberta. Weights ranged from 1 ounce for 3-year-old fish which  measured 6.4 inches average total length up to 26 ounces for 10-year-old  fish which measured 16.4 inches. From these data I derived an average  condition factor of 0.86. The lower condition factor of Pyramid Lake fish  in comparison with logan River fish indicates a difference in habitat suit­ability.  The difference in growth rates between the two waters also indi­cates  this difference (Table I).  Sigler reported that apparently the natural life span of mountain white­fish  rarely exceeds 9 years, but McHugh (1941) stated that they live at  least 18 years. He theorized that longevity varies, with slower growing  populations living longer. Other workers have rarely reported mountain  whitefish over 9 years old.  Lake Tahoe, California yielded the largest mountain whitefish that any  worker has reported. McAfee (1966) stated that it measured 22 inches and  weighed almost 6 Ibs. Sigler (1951) stated that Logan River fishermen  report mountain whitefish of 4 Ibs. and occasionally more. However the  largest whitefish Sigler examined during his study measured 17.4 inches  and weighed 38 ounces. Brown (1952) examined thousands of whitefish  in Montana and found that the heaviest weighed slightly over 3 Ibs.  McHugh (1941) stated that because of greater longevity, fish growing  slowly reach maximum sizes comparable to those growing rapidly.  Reproduction  Brown (1952) found that mountain whitefish in Montana mature in  their third year, although a few mature in their second year. In Utah  mountain whitefish spawn at 3 or 4 years at about 1f2 lb. in weight  (Sigler and Miller, 1963).  Fecundity correlates with length and weight. Brown made egg counts  of 21 females just before spawning (egg sacs still intact), and found  1,425 to 24, 143 eggs per female. A 6 ounce fish which measured 10.2  inches total length contained the smallest number, and a 3 lb., 19.5 inch  9  fish contained the largest number. Fecundity averaged 4,401 eggs per  fish or 5,343 eggs per pound of female. Sigler and Miller (1963) noted  a relationship between fecundity and size and reported a range of 6,900  to 9,400 eggs per pound of female . Sigler (1951) examined five females  of from 11 to 25 ounces in weight and found a range of 5,500 to 14,000  eggs per fish. Simon (1946) stated that mountain whitefish from Jackson  Lake, Wyoming produced an average of 6,885 eggs per pound of female  in 1938.  Sigler (1951) found that egg diameters varied from 1.94 to 2.12 mm  and increased with the size of the fish. Brown (1952) found water-hard­ened  eggs from Montana whitefish averaged 3.7 mm in diameter and  had a range of 3.1 to 4.2 mm. Simon (1946) stated that mountain w hite­fish  eggs tota led 9 12 eggs per fluid ounce.  Sigler (1951) found that ovaries of ripe fish made up 18.8% of the  body weight. Brown (1952) found that the ovaries made up 21.8% of  the body weight of one large female.  Whitefish spawn from October into December (Carl et ai, 1967 and  McAfee, 1966). Carl et al (1967) stated that mountain whitefish spawn  in mid-November in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia. In Montana  waters Brown (1952) found differences in spawning seasons among popu­lations  in different streams. Spawning occurred later at higher elevations.  In 1949 in the West Gallatin River the fish did not spawn until after  October 14 when water temperatures decreased to 42 F. Brown found  eggs in abundance in the gravel on October 28. Of the whitefish which  he examined on October 28, some had partially spawned but none had  completely spawned and others were still green. Whitefish had nearly  completed spawning by November 10. All of the fish which Brown exam­ined  on November 17 had spawned completely and some showed re­covery  from spawning. The water temperature had decreased to 40 F  by that date.  At a higher elevation on the South Fork Madison River, Brown observed  a large number of unspawned ripe fish on November 14 (1950) when the  water was 36 F. In the Yellowstone Ri ver Brown found that about Y2 of  the females had ripened and V2 remained green on October 16. On  October 20 about Y, of the females had started spawning. By November 3,  when the water temperature had reached 41 F, all of the females which  Brown examined had completed spawning.  Mountain whitefish apparently travel only short distances to spawning  areas. McAfee (1966) stated that stream populations do not seem to travel  long distances to spawn. In stream-dwelling whitefish populations, Brown  observed no mass movements or migrations and no unusual concentra­tions  of fish in known spawning areas. However he stated that a small  number of fish move into tributary streams from large rivers and use  only the lower 300 to 500 yards of the tributary streams.  Lake-dwelling populations make pronounced runs up tr ibutary streams  to spawn (McAfee, 1966 and Simon, 1946). In Montana, large runs come  into the South Fork Madison River from Hebgen Lake (Brown, 1952).  10  Brown observed that mountain whitefish concentrated in shallow water  near the shore in Cliff lake during the spawning season but he did not  show that they spawn there. McAfee (1966) reported that Cordone (un­published)  stated that some mountain whitefish in lake Tahoe apparently  spawn in the lake.  Neither sex becomes highly colored during the spawning season. Males  develop pronounced snouts (snouts appear somewhat pronounced at all  times) and prominent body tubercles. Females develop smaller body tu­bercles  (McAfee, 1966).  Mountain whitefish usually spawn in gravel and rubble in streams.  McAfee (1966) stated that whitefish usually lay eggs in the gravel of rif­fles.  Brown (1952) stated that whitefish appear to exercise little or no  selection of bottom materials. He found an abundance of eggs, in various  stages of development, in bottoms ranging from fine gravel to coarse  rubble. He found eggs in water depths of 5 inches to 4 feet, but did not  sample greater depths. He found the most eggs adjacent to strong cur­rents.  However he found some on substrata directly under rapid surface  velocities and others where surface movement of water did not occur.  Brown found no evidence that whitefish prepare nests as trout do. He  observed no noticeable disturbance of the bottom in areas which whitefish  used for spawning. He could detect spawning beds only by searching for  eggs.  Mountain whitefish begin spawning activities just after dark (Brown,  1952). Brown observed them congregating in sha llow water just before  dark during the spawning season. He watched 30 fish spawn in a 100 ft'  area just after dark on November 2, 1951. All of the fish had ripened  and males predominated in numbers. The fish spawned in groups of 2 to  5. They concentrated most densely just to the side of the main current  in water about one foot deep .The fish held their positions against the  current and at intervals the individuals within a small area moved close  together so that their bodies made contact, and as they did they almost  came to rest on the bottom. They remained so for 2 to 4 seconds and  then moved apart, sometimes separating and moving up or down stream.  Indi viduals from one group would join others and repeat the process.  No rapid or violent body movements occurred. Brown collected eggs on a  screen below the spawning groups.  Development  Mountain whitefish eggs require low temperatures for optimum devel­opment.  They hatch in about 5 months at 35 F and in about 1 month at  48 F (Sigler and Miller, 1963, and Simon, 1946). Brown (1952) observed  embryonic deve lopment of whitefish in the West Gallatin River, Mon­tana,  where whitefish spawned from October 14 to November 10. Brown  found the first eyed embryos on December 4, and noted that embryos  had become uniform in development by January 20. He observed the first  hatching individuals on March 4. Practically all fry hatched March 4 to 28  when water temperatures ranged from 40 to 42 F. On April 14 water  temperatures reached 48 F and whitefish sac fry averaged 15.8 mm total  length. On May 21 the fry averaged 27.7 mm. Brown next measured the  11  young whitefish on November 2 when they averaged 94.5 mm.  In the Yellowstone River, young averaged 55 mm total length in late  July and 120.3 mm on October 22. Brown did not measure early devel­opment  of Yellowstone River whitefish.  Development under artificial conditions may take place more rapidly  than under natural circumstances. Artificially-reared embryos from fish  from the South Fork Madison River and held at 52 F hatched 36 days after  fertilization (Brown, 1952), and living embryos eyed in 22 days. The  majority hatched in 36 days and fry had absorbed all yolk 9 days after  hatching. At a Lake Tahoe hatchery, one-half of a batch of mountain white­fish  eggs hatched in 110 days at an average water temperature of 38 F  (McAfee, 1966).  Associated Species  Mountain whitefish associate with a variety of coldwater species  throughout their range. Principal associated forms include various species  of whitefish, trout, chars, suckers, cyprinids, and cottids. Mountain white­fish  also associate with northern pike (Esox lucius), burbot (Lota Iota),  yellow perch (Perea flavescens), and stonecat (Noturus flavus) (Sigler,  1951 ; Currier and Schultz, 1957; Jordan and Evermann, 1905; Laakso,  1951; and McAfee, 1966).  Interspecific Competition  Mountain whitefish and juveniles and adults of most trout species have  similar food habits in that aquatic insects make up major portions of the  diet of both (Godfrey, 1955; Laakso, 1951 ; McAfee, 1966; McHugh, 1940;  and Rawson and Elsey, 1950). Therefore whitefish and trout may compete  for food. McAfee (1966) believed that whitefish mig ht seriously compete  with trout in places like little Truckee River, California, where chemical  treatment of a section showed that it contained a larger poundage of  whitefish than trout. Sigler (195 1) considered mountain whitefish im­portant  in Utah because ""they compete with other important game fish  for food and space.""  Whitefish may also compete for food with the pea mouth chub (My loch­eilus  caurinus), northern squawfish (Ptychocheilus oregonensis), and yel­low  perch (Perea flavescens), various suckers (Catostomus sp.). and ju­venile  sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Uses of foods by these  species vary seasonally or with availability of food forms.  Laakso (1951 ) examined stomachs of whitefish and brown trout from  the same location in Montana on November 23, 1947. He found equal  proportions of caddis lavae, stonefly nymphs and whitefish eggs in the  stomachs of each. Stomachs of both contained whitefish eggs as the most  abundant form. However, on November 29, stonefiies made up 39% of  the food volume in brown trout stomachs and only about 15% of the  food volume in whitefish stomachs.  Laa kso (1951) compared stomach contents of rainbow trout and moun­tain  whitefish and found significant differences. At one time and location,  algae comprised about 23% of the contents of rainbow stomachs but  12  whitefish stomachs contained no algae. At another time and location,  rainbow trout stomachs contained a variety of surface food, which in­cluded  adult mayflies and midges, leaf hoppers, beetles and ants. White­fish  stomachs contained none of these.  Godfrey (1955) reported that dolly varden usually eat fish and there­fore  compete little with whitefish. Godfrey also stated that the diets of  fine-scaled and white suckers, which consist mainly of insect larvae,  small mollusks, and plankton crustaceans, closely resemble the diet of  mountain whitefish.  Foerster( 1925) stated that sockeye salmon yearlings feed largely on  aquatic insect larvae.  McHugh (1940) believed that in highly productive waters only in­significant  competition between whitefish and other species would re­sult.  However, in waters which have a limited food supply, serious com­petition  might occur.  Birch (1957) defines competition as the demand, typically at the same  time, of more than one organism for a resource in excess of immediate  supply. Competition may not occur even though two organisms eat the  same f oods at the same time. Conversely, Johannes and Larkin (196 1)  showed that competition for food may occur even where two organisms  apparently do not eat the same foods. Present food avai lability and diet  may result from past competition. Nilsson (1967) also supported this  concept.  Whitefish and other species could conceivably interact in a manner  that favors sympatric fishes. For example, feeding behavior of whitefish  may dislodge invertebrates which then enter the drift and become avail­able  to trout.  Predation on Other Species  Mountain whitefish may consume eggs of other species. Sigler (1 951)  stated that mountain whitefish may prey on the eggs of trout and other  coldwater fish, and Foerster (1925) found eggs of sockeye salmon in  stomachs of mountain whitefish. Foerster thought that under certain con­ditions  mountain whitefish might adversely affect the yield of a salmon  river. Chapman and Quistorfl (1938) did not believe that w hitefish prey  on young salmonid fishes in the Columbia River. Brown (1952), and  Laakso (1951) showed that mountain whitefish eat their own eggs.  Predators and Parasites  Currier and Schultz (1957) found that lake trout (Salvelinus namayeush)  in Waterton Lakes, Alberta feed on mountain whitefish. According to  McAfee (1966) Cordone (unpublished) stated that lake trout prey on  mountain whitefish in Lake Tahoe and other waters . He believed that  brown, cutthroat and rainbow trout do likewise. Other sympatric piscivor­ous  species probably prey on mountain whitefish.  A variety of parasites infect mountain whitefish. Bangham and Adams  (1954) examined 253 mountain whitefish from 19 locations in British  13  Columbia, and found that parasites infected 213 or 84%. Bangham and  Adams took as many as 8 species of parasites from hosts in single loca­tions.  Parasites infected 57% of the whitefish sampled from streams in  the Columbia River drainage. Bangham and Adams found 19 parasitic  forms in whitefish from the Columbia River, and identified the principal  ones as Bulbodacnitis globosa, Oiscocotyle salmonis, Diphyllobothrium sp.,  Pomphorhynchus bulbocolli and Hepaticola bakeri. Parasites infected 99%  of the whitefish sampled from the Fraser River drainage. Bangham and  Adams identified 20 parasitic forms there. They found that 73% of the  whitefish from the Skeena River drainage had parasites. Seven parasites  occurred in these fish. Four parasitic forms infected 100% of the fish from  the Peace River drainage, and three forms infected 100% of the whitefish  from the liard River drainage. Bangham and Adams also examined 23  mountain w hitefish from the upper Snake River in the United States and  found that all had parasites. In whitefish from the Snake River they  identified nine species of parasites, all of which occurred in whitefish  in British Columbia.  Sigler (1951) stated that stomach nematodes parasitized whitefish in  two collections which he took from the Logan Ri ver, Utah in 1948 and  1949. He said that the fish showed no loss of condition. Sigler also re­corded  two infestations of external parasites, one copepod and one un­identified.  Duff (1932) reported that mountain whitefish suffered the highest  mortality of any species during a period of high infestation of furunculosis  in Elk River, British Columbia. The furunculosis appeared as hemorrhagic  circular areas between the pelvic fins or on other parts of the ventral  surface.  Importance  Mountain whitefish have the potential to become an important game  and commercial species in western North America. They comprise a major  portion of the fish biomass in many coldwater lakes and streams which  occur within their range (Sigler, 1951 ; Jeppson, 1959; McAfee, 1966; and  Rawson and Elsey, 1950). McAfee (1966) and McHugh (1940) stated that  mountain whitefish have a delicious taste, and noted that some people  prefer mountain whitefish over other freshwater species for eating.  Sigler (1951) stated that mountain whitefish have not become com­mercially  important in either the United States or Canada. No one has  made an extensive attempt to use the fish commercially in the United  States. Efforts in Canada failed because of economic reasons. Sigler be­lieved  that the rather limited distribution of the mountain whitefish and  its relatively small numbers in any particular population have prevented  commercial interests from developing the fishery. Jeppson (1959) stated  that the commercial fishery in Lake Pend O'reille, Idaho consisted pri­marily  of mountain whitefish prior to the 1940's. During the 1940's  kokanee began replacing them in the commercial catch. McAfee (1966)  stated that a commercial fishery on mountain whitefish formerly existed  in Lake Tahoe in conjunction with harvests of Lahontan cutthroat trout.  Indians of western Canada take them in gill nets for food (McHugh, 1940).  14  As a sporting fish, the mountain whitefish has more potential. It readily  takes artificial flies or bait and puts up a good fight when the angler  hooks it (Carl et ai, 1967; Dill and Shapovalov, 1939; Laakso, 1951;  McAfee, 1966; and McHugh, 1940). Mountain whitefish provide consider­able  sports fish ing in lakes and rivers of Alberta and British Columbia  (McHugh, 1940). Whitefish fishing may produce best results during winter  because of their active winter feeding habits (Laakso, 1951 i and McAfee,  1966). In Lake Pend O'reille anglers harvest the greatest numbers of  mountain whitefish during winter when they find poor kokanee fishing  (Jeppson, 1959). In Montana anglers seek them in winter when state law  prohibits fishing for trout (Brown, 1952).  But most anglers still do not appreciate the mountain whitefish. Sigler  (1951) noted that the fish does not appeal to Utah fishermen from the  standpoint of either sport or table use. Brown (1952) and McAfee (1966)  also reported that Montana and California fishermen respectively have a  generally low regard for the fish . Dill and Shapovalov (1939) attributed  lack of popularity of whitefish to its superficial similarity to suckers, and  to the indiscriminate use of the word ""whitefish"" for several large min­nows,  particularly the squawfish (Ptychochei lus grandis). However the  mountain whitefish has increased in popularity in recent years. Gaffney  (1960), in an attempt to popularize w hitefish in Montana, outlined  methods of capture, discussed palatability, and provided recipes and  smoking techniques.  Management  McAfee (1966) believed that, in their native waters, mountain whitefish  make up an interesting and desirable part of the fauna even though they  may limit trout production somewhat. He stated that such waters usually  contain fairly good trout populations and that, from a practical standpoint,  trout fishing would probably not improve greatly if fisheries managers  removed the whitefish. McAfee did not believe that managers should  presently attempt to extend the range of the mountain whitefish because  anglers regard the species as inferior and a competitor with existing game  fish. Therefore he believed that managers should aim at encouraging  greater utilization of an underharvested, unappreciated, and in some  places, abundant resource.  Utah officials discouraged the use of mountain whitefish by giving  them the same legal status as trout (Sig ler, 1951). Therefore anglers pre­ferred  to fill their limits with trout rather than with the less popular  whitefish. Montana lengthened the season and allowed icefishing for  whitefish to increase the harvest. This management program succeeded  because mountain whitefish feed much more actively than trout in winter  months (Laakso, 1951). Montana found that the administrative problems  involved in this type of management did not hamper the program as much  as they believed it would. Wyoming has also used educational campaigns  and special regulations on seasons and bag limits to stimulate angling for  whitefish (McAfee, 1966).  Literature Cited  Bangham, Ralph V. and James R.

Growth Responses and Nutrient Relations  of Fertilized and Unfertilized Grand Fir,  By H. Loewenstein and F. H. Pitkin2  INTRODUCTION  Beneficial results from forest land fertilization in other areas (White  and Leaf, 1957, Walker and Beacher, 1963) prompted several Idaho  experiments involving tree nuhition. One such study, rep01ted earlier  (Loewenstein and Pitkin, 1963) dealt with a site supp01ting planted  ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) and western wlute pine (Pinus  monticola Douglas), as well as naturally occurring grand fir (Abies  grandis [Doug!.] Lindl. ). The grand fir and white pine responded sig­nificantly  to nitrogen additions; the ponderosa pine did not.  A second Idaho experiment concerned a natural stand of grand fir  with some admixture of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.]  Franco.) in the 20 to 30 year old age class. The site, on a gentle n01th  slope, is located on the College of Forestry Experimental Forest (Flat  Creek unit ). The habitat type (Daubenmire & Daubenmire, 1968) is  Abies grandis-Pachistima myrsinites. Soil supporting the stand has a pH  of 5.5, and a silt loam texture. 1oisture percene at the 15 atmosphere  point is 9.51; the ¥.! atmosphere point is 35.42. Organjc matter in the  surface 11Uneral horizon totals 3.4 percent. Fo/&gt; !l:~.sArne horizon total  nitrogen assayed 0.13 percent, available phosphorus 60 'ppm, and ex­changeable  potassium 260 ppm.  Each treated plot received a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus  and potassium fertilizer at the following rates: 300 lb/acre nitrogen as  ammonium sulfate, 150 lb/ acre phosphorous as treble super phosphate,  and 150 lb/ acre potassium as muriate of potash. Fertilizer was applied  in the spring of the year.  A dramatic growtl1 response as a result of fertilization was recorded  by grand fir. Measurement of control and h·eated plots revealed that  significant differences occurred not only in the second year following  fertilization, but also in the 2 following years. Because of the excellent  results from fettilizer addition in this experiment, a detailed comparison  of fertilized and unfertilized trees in regard to growth responses and  nutrient content was undertaken. The present paper reports the results  of this work.  1 Published with the approval of the Director, Forest, Wildlife and Range Experi­ment  Station, University of Idaho, Moscow.

Professor and Associate Professor of Forestry, respectively.  3  PROCEDURE  Four growing seasons after plot fertilization, a tree from the treated  area and a tree from the control plot were selected for the detailed  growth, nuhient, and wood quality analysis. 1 he trees chosen were  ::~mong the largest on the plots. Prior to felling, increment borings re­vealed  that the 2 specimens were the same age ( 25) and that before  fertilization, their growth rates were quite similar.  The trees were cut at the ground line ( no roots were excavated)  and laid on large plastic sheets. Total height growth was recorded, as  well as annual growth for the 3 years before fertilization, the year of  fe1tilization, and the 3 following years. The branches were then removed  from the stems. Needles produced in the harvest year were separated  from older needles and current year branches separated from older  branches. Branch and needle samples were oven dried in the laboratory,  where the total weight of each component was determined. Following  weighing, the material was ground in a 'Wiley mill and carefully sub­sampled  for nutrient analysis.  In the field, the bark was removed from each stem, and subse­quently  dried, weighed, ground, and subsampled for nutrient analysis in  the laboratory. After bark removal, the stems were cut into 4-foot sec­tions,  the diameter at the center of each section being recorded. Volume  calculations were made using these data.  A l-inch thick cross-sectional disk was removed from the sections  at the center points. In the laboratory these disks were used to determine  the width of spring and summer wood portions of the annual rings,  number of cells produced, and the specific gravity of the wood developed  in the 3-ye.:'lr period prior to and following the year of fertilization.  The wood from each section was dried and weighed in the labora­tory,  then ground and subsampled for nuh·ient analysis. The weight of  the disks used in making the determinations described above was taken  into account when calculating total nuh·ient content of the various  sections.  Nitrogen in tissues was determined by the Kjeldahl method, p hos­phorus  levels were found using the vanadomolybdophosphoric color­metric  method, and potassium was determined by flame photometry.  Procedures used were similar to those given by Jackson (1958).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Diameter and Height Growth  F ertilization markedly affected diameter growth. For the 3-year  period immediately piior to fertilization, the tree from the control plot  had an increase in DBH of 0.38 inches; the fertilized tree grew 0.50  inches in diameter during this same period. After fe1tilization, the three  year growth record indicated that the conh·ol ti·ee again gained 0.38  inches in diameter, whereas for the same pe1iod, the fertilized tree  4  realized a 1.26 inch diameter increment. Fertilization more than doubled  diameter growth of the treated specimen.  The effect of nitrogen treatment on height growth of the sample  trees was less striking than the effect on diameter growth. During the 3-  year period following treabnent, height increment of the control tree was  108 percent of that found for the 3-year period before fertilization, the  ~.:orresponding figure for the fertilized tree was l.l5 p ercent. On another  site (Loewenstein and Pitkin, 1963), the stimulus to height growth re­sulting  from fertilization was much greater. The fact that in some situ­ations  height increment is the growth factor most affected by fertilization  and in other situations response is concentrated more in diameter incre­ment  has been noted previously, but the reasons for such variation in  the type of response are not well documented.  Dry Weight  Striking differences in the dry weight of the fertilized and unfer­t  ilized tree are graphically revealed in Figure l.  !500  o~uu~~~~~llW~  NEW OLD  NEEDLES  [lliiJ UNFERTILIZED  Itt:] FERTILIZED  Figure 1. Dry weight of above ground components of fertilized and unfertilized  grand fir.  5  Of particular interest are the data for stemwood, which weighed  about twice as much in the fertilized tree than in the control. That this  difference is attributable to treatment is evident from a consideration of  the following. Calculations based on measurements made on cross­sections  from the lower portions of the stems indicate that immediately  prior to fertilization cross-sectional areas of the 2 specimens were similar  (about 1.5/square inches). Upon harvest, the total cross-sectional area  in the lower portion of the fertilized stem was 5.3 square inches; that of  the control was only 2.59 square inches. Seventy-three percent of the  total cross-sectional area of the fertilized specimen developed in the  3-year period following treatment; the figure for the control is only  about 37 percent. As discussed later, fertilization did not strongly influ­ence  density of the wood. Thus we may conclude that the fertilizer  addition, stimulating diameter growth particularly, was mainly responsi­ble  for the great disparity in the weight of the woody pmtion of the  stems.  Dry weight of each other component, particularly current year  needles and stem bark, was also greater in the fertilized tree than in the  unh·eated specimen.  About 42 percent of the total above ground dry weight of the feitil­ized  tree was in stemwood; the corresponding figure for the control was  approximately 32 percent. The propmtion of total d1y weight in foliage,  on the other hand, apparently was not affected by treatment. Foliage  accounted for about 28 percent of the above ground dty weight of the  h·ee in both sample trees.  Specific Gravity  Wood from both tl1e fertilized and w1fe1tilized specimens decreased  in specific gravity in the 3-year period following fertilization (Table 1 ).  While the small sample size precludes any definitive judgement, it ap­pears  that a greater decrease occurred in the bole of the fertilized tree.  This result, of course, is not unusual (Larson, 1968). One of the chief  concerns voiced in regard to forest fertilization has to do with precisely  such effects on wood quality. In the current instance we believe, as did  Erickson and Lambert ( 1958), the great increment in wood fiber result­ing  from fertilization overshadows any minor influence on specific  gravity.

As treatment stimulated production of both, the  net change in proportion of summerwood was moderate. Data from the  lower portion of the bole are illustrative of the findings. Springwood  production of the control tree for the 3 years following the year of  treatment was 99.6 percent of that achieved in the three years before  treatment; the similar figure for the fertilized tree was 246.7 percent.  Summerwood production of the control for the 3-year interval after  treatment was 100 percent of the production during the three years  before treatment; the similar figure for the fertilized h·ee was 173.8  percent. Further calculations show that for this lower portion of the bole,  the percent of total wood production in control latewood was essentially  the same during the 3-year p eriods immediately before and after the year  of treatment. The portion of total wood production in summerwood  decreased in the fertilized tree-from 15.1 percent before the year of  treatment to 11.2 p ercent for the 3-year span following the year of  treatment.  Number of Cells  The number of cells were counted in 4 transects across the growth  rings. Data for the lower bole are represen tative of trends found. For  the 3-year pe1iods immediately preceding and following the year of  treatment, the average number of spring and summerwood cells across  cross-sectional transects of the control disk varied little. The number of  cells in cross-sectional transects from the h·eated specimen, on the other  hand, reflected the influence of fertilization. Average number of cells in  the sp1ingwood h·ansects rose from 79 prior to treatment to a total of  164 for the 3-year period subsequent to the year of fertilization. Similar  figures for summerwood are 25 and 30, respectively.  Nutrient Content  Total nih·ogen, phosphorus, and potassium content in above ground  portions of h·ees was sh·ongly affected by fertilization (Table 2). The  data illustrate the value of expressing nutrient content on an absolute,  as well as on the more common concentration basis. From the standpoint  of concentration, there is no difference in the percentage of phosphorus,  for example. Because of the much greater weight of the fertilized tree,  however. the actual amount of phosphorus in it is much greater than  that in the control. A similar situa tion is illustrated by the data for  nitrogen and potassium- little difference in concentration; a large dif-  Table 2.

Nuh·ient percentages in the various tree components are tabulated  in Table 3. H.egardless of the particular nutrient, differences in concen­tration  between the fertilized and unfertilized specimens are not large.  In some instances, (e. g. potassium in new ami old needles) the com­ponents  from the unfertilized h·ee actually exhibited a higher nuhient  percentage than did the components from the fertilized tree. This, in the  case of new needles, is probably an example of the ""dilution effect,"" the  nutrients in the tree stimulated by fertilization being dish·ibuted through  a great deal more tissue than in the conh·ol.

Data for stems represent the average for the entire bole. There  were, however, appreciable differences between concentration of ele·  ments in cross-section samples from the lower bole and the upper bole.  These differences presumably reflect the fact that the samples from the  upper bole were largely sapwood, whereas the lower cross-sectional  samples contained appreciable amounts of heartwood. Additionally, the  upper sample from the fertilized h·ee consisted almost entirely of wood  formed since the year of treatment. Thus, for example. this section  contained 0.7 percent nitrogen, compared to an average of 0.11 for the  entire bole.  A comparison of the quantity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium  contained in the various above ground components of the fmtilized and  nnfertilized trees is presented in Figures 2, 3. and 4. In contrast to the  data concerning percentae;e values (Table 3), large differences between  fmtilized and unfertilized trees in ach1al nuh·ient content are apparent.  Four growing seasons after treatment, current year (new) needles from  the fe1tilized tree contained 15.45 grams of nitrogen, 2.28 grams of  nhosphorus. and 10.78 grams of potassium. The corresponding figures for  the unfertilized tree were 8.78 grams of nitrogen, 1.41 grams of phos-  8  phorus, and 8.11 grams of potassium. Although the magnitude of differ­ence  was not as large as in the case of current year needles, total nitrogen  and phosphorus content of older needles from the fertilized specimen  was appreciably greater than that of the control. Potassium content of  older needles from the unfertilized tree was slightly greater than the  content of that element in older needles of the h·eated sapling. It is of  pru-ticular interest to note that the nih·ogen, phosphorus, and potassium  content of the stemwood of the fertilized tree was more than 2¥.! times  that of the control.  25  2  Ill  ::::E  &lt;  a:  I!)  15  lliiill UNFERTILIZED  • FERTILIZED  Figure 2.

In this regard, the data for nitrogen are  graphed in Figme 5. Because trends were very similar to that of nitrogen,  specific infom1ation concerning phosphorus and potassium is not pre­sented  . About 50 percent of the nih·ogen in the above ground portion of  the fertilized b·ees was contained in new needles; 46 p ercent of the total  nitrogen was found in new needles of the control h·ee. For older needles,  the comparative figw·es are 15 and 12 percent, respectively, for treated  and unh·eated sp ecimens. The disparity in the figures for current and  older needles is explained largely by the fact that the latter component  had a much lower dry weight than the former ( Figure 1). Concentration  of nitrogen in older tissue was also somewhat lower than in current year  tissue (Table 3). The older branches contained more of the above  ground nitrogen in the h·ees than did the current year twigs, the bark,  and the stemwood combined.

Previous plot measure­ments  had indicated significant increment gains from the fertilizer appli­cation.  F ertilization more than doubled diameter growth during the 3-year  period following the year of treatment, in comparison to that achieved  for a similar period immediately prior to treahnent. Although fertiliza­tion  appeared to also stimulate height growth, the elfect on this para­meter  was not nearly as pronounced.  Dry weight of all above ground components increased as a result of  treatment. The effect was particularly evident in the case of stemwood,  the bole of the fertilized specimens weighing twice that of the control.  Factors associated with wood quality (percent summerwood, spe­cific  gravity) appeared to be adversely affected hy fertilization, but only  moderately. These adverse effects were overshadowed by the great gain  in fiber.  No large increases in concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, or  potassium in the various components resulted from fertilization. Because  of the greater amount of dry matter in the treated specimen, however,  large increases occurred in the actual quantity of the tlu·ee nuh;ents  contained in the tissues. Content of the elements in the stemwood of the  fertilized tree, for example, was 2lh times that of the control.  About half of the total nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium found  in the above ground portions of both the fertilized and the control tree  was located in current year needles.

Schenk2, Dale 0 . Everson3, and James R. Gosz'  ABSTRACT  The results of a study in 1966 to ascertain the accuracy of  branch-sample counts for estimating total cone (seed) production  in a closed, natural stand of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are re­ported.  Binocular counts of the cones were made on 2 opposite  branches, each bearing a maximum number cones. Ocular counts  of the number of cone-bearing branches per tree also were made.  Regression analyses were run using single branch counts, 2-branch  totals, and combinations of these with the product of average  number of cones per branch and number of cone-bearing branches  as independent variables. Actual counts were obtained by climbing  each tree and recording the number of cones by branch. Poly­nomial  regressions to degree 3 and log transformations also were  tested. An acceptable estimate of total cone crop was obtained  from a simple linear regression using as the independent variable  the product of the observed number of cone-bearing branches and  the average of a two-branch count. Average cone-bearing Douglas­fir  per acre, seed per cone, seed per acre, and insect-destroyed seed  acre also are reported.  Additional key words: Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco, cone  and seed insects, seed losses.  Intensive management of second-growth forest stands and expand­ing  reforestation programs require accurate data on the insect popula­tions  responsible for cone and seed losses. Past research has provided  various survey techniques for gathering data on damage, but relatively  little work has been done to ascertain the inter-relationships between  fluctuations in cone crop and insect populations. This knowledge would  permit location of seed sources and timing of collection, such that a  maximum supply of undamaged seed could be obtained at minimum cost  without recourse to insecticides.

The prime requisite for the acquisition of this knowl­edge  is a rapid and reasonable method of estimating cone production.  Allen (1941) showed that fall counts of female cone buds of coastal  Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco provided  an estimate of the subsequent cone crop. He also suggested that the ratio  of cone buds to vegetative buds would provide a basis for estimating the  cone crop in broad classes. Johnson (1962) reported that fall counts of  cone buds of coastal Douglas-fir provided a reliable sample of the sub­sequent  cone crop. In British Columbia, Garman (1951) made cone  counts on one side of coastal Douglas-fir crowns using tripod-mounted  binoculars during several seasons, and compared those with total counts  from trees felled periodically. He concluded that doubling a sample  count from a young tree provided a reliable estimate of cone crop of that  tree. In mature trees, however, the correction factor varied with total  count. Wenger (1953) recommended that in estimating the number of  cones on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), all cones visible through binocu­lars  should be counted with the observer facing back to sun. That count  should then be doubled and multiplied by a factor obtained from com­paring  the total pick to the count on the first 15 to 25 trees. He reported  considerable variations in counts among three observers. Hoekstra (1960)  used Wenger's method in slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii En~elm.)  and noted increased accuracy with tripod-mounted binoculars, and little  variation between observer's counts. Fowells and Schubert (1956) count­ed  cones in crowns of various conifers in northern California with binoc­ulars.  The count per tree was multiplied by 1.5 to obtain the total  number of cones per tree. The factor was based on the assumption that  two-thirds of the crown could be seen from one point. To obtain the most  rapid and accurate estimate of cone crop on open-growing coastal Doug­las-  fir with at least 100 cones per tree, Winjum and Johnson (1962)  recommended that observers stand on the south side of the tree at a  point affording a clear view, and count all cones on 1 branch of each  whorl. The sum of branch counts was inserted in the equation:  Y""' = -253 + 7.76X (Sy.x = 311; r = .97)  where X = sum of branch counts. They also tested other methods, in­cluding  variations in the number and position of the branches on which  cones were counted, and photographic techniques. Redlin (1964) made  weekly cone counts in 4 plots of coastal Douglas-fir on Vancouver  Island, British Columbia to obtain data on cone production, insect  caused damage, and cone-insect populations. He made complete cone  counts when cone production was light. However, only cones on 1  branch in each whorl on 2 sides of the tree were counted when the cone  crop was heavy. In the latter case, the number was halved and multi­plied  by the average number of branches per whorl.  The results of a study conducted in late June; 1966, to ascertain the  accuracy of branch sample counts in a natural closed stand of Rocky  Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.)  Franco) are reported here.  4  Methods and Materials  Description of Test Stands  A rectangular (strip) plo~ of 0.3 acre was established in each of 3  stands containing Douglas-fir and associated species. Two plots (""Priest  River"" and ""Ridge Road') were located in the U.S. Forest Service Priest  River Experimental Forest, Bonner County, Idaho; the third (""Horse  Heaven""), in the Deception Creek Experimental Forest, Kootenai Coun­ty,  Idaho.  The Priest River plot (""Area 1"") was established approximately 1/ 4  mile west of Forest Headquarters in a Thuja plicata Donn-Tsue;a het­erophylla  (Raf.) Sarg./ Pachistima myrsinites (Pursh.) Raf. association at  an elevation of 2300 feet with negligible slope. The Ridge Road plot  (""Area 2"") was located 2.7 miles east of Headquarters on South Ridge  Road in a Pseudotsuga menziessii/Physocarpus malvaceous (Green)  Kuntze association at an elevation of 3100 feet on a very steep south­facing  slope. The Horse Heaven plot (""Area 3"") was situated northwest  of Horse Heaven landing field in the NWI/4 Section 21, R1W, T52N in  an Abies grandis (Doug!.) Lindl./Pachistima association at an elevation  of 2300 feet on a north-facing ridge top. Tree species composition, den­sity  and proportion of cone bearing Douglar-fir are summarized in  Table 1.  5  Ol  Table 1.

Each of  these trees was observed through 7 x 50 binoculars from a point affording  the clearest view of the crown. All cones were counted on a silhouetted  (side) branch bearing the maximum number of cones in the belief that  those branches could be most easily detected in a closed stand. The pro­cedure  was repeated to select a second branch on the side of crown  opposite the first branch. All sample counts were made by the same per­son  to eliminate the small error beween observers. (Occasional checks  showed that differences between counts obtained by 3 different observ­ers  seldom exceeded 2-3 cones/branch ). The true number of cones per  tree was obtained by climbing each tree and recording, by cone-bearing  branch, the actual number of cones produced. Removal of the flagging  immediately after completion of the total count eliminated the possi­bility  of sampling any tree twice. Counts in the 3 plots were completed  within a period of 1 week in mid-June, 1966.  A sample of 104 cones was collected from a total of 8 trees only from  the Priest River and Ridge Road plots (13 cones from each of 2 trees,  and from each of 6 trees from each plot, respectively. The cone crop  was very light, and cone development less advanced, in the Priest River  plot). The cones were dissected scale by scale to obtain an estimate of  the average number of seeds per cone, and average percent sound and  insect-damaged seed.  Table 2.

The futility of using the estimated number of cones from either  branch or both branches to predict total cone production is shown in  Tables 2 and 3. The standard deviation of total cone production is 165.2.  The standard errors of estimate when total production is regressed on  either estimated cones from branch 1, branch 2 or the sum of both  branches are 108.2, 102.2, and 102.0. However, at best only 62.4% of the  variation in cone production is accounted for by the sum of both branch­es.  Expressing the independent and dependent variables in logarithms  did little to improve the fit. Similarly fitting a third degree polynomial  failed to increase precision.  Comparison of the observed numbers of cone-bearing branches per  tree with the actual numbers showed that, on the average, 61 percent  (44-100%) of the true number were visible from the single vantage point  on the ground. This compares favorably with the ratio (67%) reported by  Fowells and Shubert {1956). Consequently, the observed number of cone­bearing  branches was multiplied by the factor 1.6 to obtain ""adjusted""  estimates of the number of cone-bearing branches per tree (X,). These  ""adjusted"" estimates were then used to comprise an independent vari­able  which was used in combination with either the ocular counts of  cones per branch 1 (X1), branch 2 (X2), or the sum of the 2 branches {X3)  to predict total number of cones per tree (Table 3).

Multiple regression analyses utilizing number of cone-bearing  branches along with either of the 3 aforementioned independent vari­ables  improved the fit considerably as shown in Table 3.  The standard error of estimate was reduced to 74.9 when the sum of  both branches (X3) and the ""adjusted"" number of cone-bearing branches  (X4) were used as predictors with a coefficient of determination of 80  percent. The estimating equation was:  Y = -109.7 + 13.32 X3 + 6.00 X4  Even more precision was attained by a new predictive variable  which was the product of average number of cones per branch times the  observed (""unadjusted"") number of cone-bearing branches (X5). The  standard error of estimate was 68.4 and 83.1 percent of the variation was  accounted for by:  A  y = 15.7 + .8696 XG  Seed Production and Loss  An F-test was conducted to determine homogeneity of variances in  the 2 plots from which seed counts were made. There was no difference  at the 1% level, and the null hypothesis of variance equality was accept­ed  for both total and damaged seeds per cone.  In 1966, the cone-bearing Douglas-fir on the 2 plots in the Priest  River Experimental Forest produced an average of 42.15 seeds per cone  (Range 22 to 64; s-x= 0.89; CL.05 = 40.38 to 43.92; s2 = 83.24).  With an average of 70 cone-bearing Douglas-fir per acre (combined  Priest River and Ridge Road plots, Table 1), and each tree bearing an  average of 161 cones (actual count) 475,031 seeds per acre were pro­duced,  15.72% of which were already destroyed by innsects early in the  growing season. The proportion of damaged seeds would have been con­siderably  greater if samples had been taken later in the summer or in  the fall.  Covariance analysis showed little or no association (r xy = +0.076)  between the number of damaged seeds per cone and the total number of  available seed per cone.  9  UN~snY OF IDAHO UB~V  Literature Cited  1.

Yang. · ·  This experiment included twenty-four progenies of Pinus taiwanensis Hay.  Taiwan red pine from eight national-forest regions throughout the natural  range of this species . The primary purpose was to investigate the intra-species  variation as a basis for genetic improvement. We accomplished this by ob­serving  the variation of geographic seed sources under uniform growth condi­tions.  by analyzing the .. among-stand'' and .. within-stand .. components of vari­ance  in the natural population. and by evaluating the site x progeny interaction  at different elevations.  Results of early seedling growth indicated marked differences among  progenies and provenances. The estimated components of variance showed a  much larger porportion of variation in growth rate attributable to .. among­stand  .. sources than to .. within-stand .. sources. In the three plantations there  were distinct differences in seedling growth. but progenies maintained the  characters of geographic seed origins.  MAT ER IALS AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN  The natural range of distribution of P. taiwanensis in Taiwan is from 700  m to 3200 m. For this study. seeds were collected from nine natural stands at  elevations from 900 m to 2450 m (Table 1 ). Each stand was represented by  one to five trees . They were dominant or codominant trees without obvious  defects.  Seeds were sown in December 1970 m three nurseries close to the plant­ing  sites in individual 6 x 12 em cylindrical plastic containers arranged in 1 a­replicate  seed beds. At the beginning of the second growing season the seed ­lings  were outplanted at three elevations: ( 1) 450 m (Taipei District Nursery.  Lat. 121° 35 .. N Long . 24° 55 .. E). (2) 1050 m (University Forest. 120° 45 .. N.  23° 42 .. E). and (3) 2305 m (University Farm. 121° 10 .. N. 24° 05 .. E). Each  plantation consisted of eight complete replicates of randomly arranged 4 -  tree plots at 3 .3 m spacing.  The seedling characters observed at 16 months included seedling height.  stem diameter. number of lateral buds. and length of secondary needles.  Analysis of variance indicated that the differences in the above characters  were significant at the .01 level in the three plantations.  · Published With the approval of the 0 1rector of Forest.

Fast-growing geographic  sources were nearly three times higher than the slow-growing sources at the  end of the first growing season.  Analysis of variance indicated that the "" among-stand"" and "" among prog­eny""  differences were significant at the .01 level. at each of the three eleva­tions  (Table 2). and in the combined analysis of the three plantations (Table 3) .  The major disjunctive "" among-stand"" difference was found between the group  of three fast-growing stands (Nos. 3 . 1. and 2) and the group of six slow­growing  stands (Nos. 5 . 4 . 8 . 6 . 9 . and 7) . With only minor modifications. the  rankings of the stand performance remained essentially the same (Table 4) .  No sign ificant "" among-stand'' difference was found among the six slow  growing stands . But one fast-growing stand (No. 3) was so outstanding at the  low elevation (450 m) that its difference with stands 1 and 2 was highly signi­ficant  (Table 4) .  STEM DIAMETER  In the "" among-stand"" and "" within-stand"" differences the pattern of stem  diameters variation was essentially the same as that of seedling height in the  TABLE 3 .

OF IDAHO LIBRARY  ESTIMATED COMPONENTS OF VARIANCE  In general. sixty to over seventy-seven percent of the total variance in  seedling height was attributable to "" among-stand"" sources. and only ten to  twenty j!)ercent to ""within-stand "" sources . A similar ratio of ""among-stand""  and ""within-stand"" components was found in stem diameter (Table 5) .  There was obvious uniformity in height growth and tree form among prog­enies  of common geographic sources (Fig . 3) . In the combined analysis of  variance of three plantations ""among-progeny"" differences were sianifi­cant  within stands Nos. 1. 3 and 8 . but no significant "" among-progeny"" dif­ferences  were found within stands Nos . 2 . 4 . 6 and 9 . The high ratio of  "" among-stand"" and "" within-stand"" components indicated that in this species  far great er variation could be expected among trees from different geographic  areas than within a restricted area .

The "" among-plantation"" differences in seedling  height and stem diameter were significant at the .01 level (Table 3) . At the  6-month stage the 450 m plantation was the tallest in mean seedling height.  and the 2305 m plantation was the shortest. But at the 16-month stage the  450 m plantation became the shortest and the 2305 m plantation the tallest  (Table 6).  TABLE 6.

There was no significant si te x provenance interation (Table 3). The relat ive  performance in the seedling height and stem diameter of the geographic seed  sources as indicated by rankings of stand means was essentially the same in  the three plantations irrespective of the 1800 m difference in altitude (Table  4 ).  GEOGRAPHIC AND ALTITUDINAL VARIATION OF SEED SOURCES  The performance of seed sources revealed a distinct geographic and al­titudinal  pattern of variation . Among the nine natural stands three geographic  groups are recognizable :  1 . A group of fast-growing low elevation seed sources from the western  watershed of the central region . This group was represented by stands Nos.  1. 2. and 3 . They covered an altitudinal range of 900- 1180 m.  2 . A stand of slow-growing low elevation trees from the eastern water­shed  of the southern region . This is stand No. 4 . from the Yue- Li Forest Region  ( 1200 m). In growth rate this stand was significantly different from the first  group of low elevation seed sources. but not significantly different from the  next group of high elevation seed sources.  3 . A group of slow -growing high elevation seed sources from both sides  of the Central Divide. between 2000 and 2450 m in altitude . This group in ­cludes  stands Nos. 5. 6. 7. 8 and 9 .  There was a distinct negative correlation between early seedling growth  and the altitude of seed origin . The group of low elevation seed sources out­grew  the others at all three elevations. 450 m. 1050 m. and 2305 m at the 16-  mont h st age. They sustained light frost damage at the 2305 m plantation.  DISCUSSION  This study was planned to demonstrate intra-species variation of a forest  tree species. and to develop basic knowledge related to the natural popula­tion  and its improvement . This is the first progeny and provenance test for an  indigenous forest tree of this region . The wide range of geographic variation  exceeded fondest expectations. Seedlings of the fast-growing seed sources  were nearly three times faster in height growth than the slow-growing seed  sources. Difference in growth rate of this magnitude promises substantial im­provement  through further progeny and provenance selections .  In the three altitudinal test plantations at 450 m. 1050 m. and 2305 m  respectively. the seed source differences cons istently reflected the char­acters  of the geographic seed origin . There was no significant site x proven­ance  interaction. Furthermore. the estimated components of variance indicat­ed  that a much larger proportion of total variance was attributable to the  "" among-stand"" sources than to the "" among-progeny""-""within-stand"" sources.  From the practical point of view the high ratio of "" among-stand"" and "" w ithin ­stand""  components indicated that se lection of geographic seed sources would  be a more rewarding initial step for genetic improvement than phenotypic  selection of individual trees within a limited population of unknown merit.  9  10  Fig. 3 .

Nitrogen Compounds in Streams as Affected  by Aerial Fertilization of Northern Idaho Forests'  by  II. Loewenstein, F. H. Pitkin, and D. C. Scan lin~  Aerial application of commercial fertilizer to forest lands for the pur­pose  of stimula ting tree growth is rapidly gaining acceptance as a man­agement  tool. Concern has been voiced, however, that such treatment  may result in eutrophication of wa ter in streams of the a ffected area,  even leading to pollution of domestic water supplies of local communi­ties.  These undesirable side-effects of fertilization programs have been  noted in certain agricultural situations.  There have been studies made elsewhere in the northwest rela ting  to water quality as influenced by forest fertilization operations (Klock,  1971, .\Ialueg, Powers and Krawczyk, 1972). Because of the many en­vironmental  differences, results of these investigations cannot readily be  used to predict changes in water q uality whi ch might occur after fertili­zer  applications to forests of the Inland Empire.  The work reported here was undertaken to pro\""ide specific informa­tion  relating to the impact of aerial fertilization on water q uality of  streams associated with three forest sites in northern Idaho.  Sites  In a trial of aerial fertilization potential for stimulating forest growth  in northern Idaho, the Sta te of Idaho Department of Public Lands con­tracted  for treatment of three small watersheds in 1972. Urea fertilizer  was applied by helicopter to these lands at a rate of 200 lbs. nitrogen  per acre (see cover photo).  The Twenty-mile site ( near Bonners F erry) encompasses 182 acres.  slopi ng 25 percent to the south and southwest. The stand here consists  mainly of sixty to seventy-year- old Douglas-fir and lodgepole p ine,  with smaller components of grand fir, larch, and cedar. \Vishbone Creek  flows through the area and drains into Twent y-mile Creek just below  the fertilizer treatment zone. This la tter creek is tapped for domestic  water by the small community of Naples.  The second experimental site (Hollywood, near the town of Pierce)  involves 127 acres. Slopes vary from 10 to 50%, with aspects generally  northwest and southeast. The 30 year-old stand consists of Douglas-fir  (55%), grand fir ( 35%) with the remainder being larch and western  white pine. A chemical thinning treatment had been applied on this site  in 1971, but was largely unsuccessful. Two small watercourses (Creeks  1 and 2 ) arise in the treated area and drain into Quartz Creek (off the  site).  1 Published with appro,·al of the Director, Forest, Wildlife and Range Expt.

This site is mountainous, has an average slope of 40% with all aspects  represented. The 50 year-old timber stand is 98% grand fir, the remainder  being Douglas-fir, cedar and larch. An intermittent fork of Mica Creek  arises from a spring located on the area and flows out of it.  The Twenty-mile and Hollywood areas were fertilized in the spring  of 1972; the Crystal Peak site was treated in the fall of 1972. The heli­copter  pilot was directed to leave a 50-foot buffer strip on both sides of  all streams. As will be noted later, this objective was not properly ac­hieved.  Procedures  Collection points for sampling of water for analysis were as follows:  Twenty-mile Site-Upper Wishbone Creek (above the fertilized  area); Lower Wishbone Creek (below the fertilized area); and  Twenty-mile Creek at a point 4 miles downstream from the fer­tilized  area where the creek is tapped for domestic water supplies  by the town of Naples.  Hollywood Site-Creek 1 (at point just below fertilized area);  Creek 2 (at point just below fertilized area); Upper Quartz Creek  (point on Quartz Creek above junctions with Creeks 1 and 2);  and Lower Quartz Creek (point below junctions with Creeks 1  and 2).  Crystal Peak Site-Upper Mica Creek (on fertilized area at spring  where creek arises); and Lower Mica Creek (at point just below  fertilized area).  Water samples were taken in plastic containers at intervals and frozen  until analysis. Determinations made included urea-nitrogen (Newell,  et. al., 1967), ammonium-nitrogen (Chapman and Pratt, 1961), and  nitrate-nitrogen, utilizing an Orion specific ion electrode according to  manufacturers directions.  Results  Twenty-mile Site-Prior to fertilization of this site which took place  on the morning of :\1ay 20th, level of urea nitrogen in waters was neg­ligable  (Figure 1 ). By the evening of ~1ay 20 ( 12 hours after treatment)  urea-nitrogen in Lower Wishbone Creek had risen to approximately 1  ppm. Ground observers noted that the proposed buffer strip the water­course  was penetrated during fertilizer application, and some of the urea  pellets fell directly in the stream. This, then, would account for the sud­den  increase in the urea-nitrogen level. A rise in urea-nitrogen was also  noted in upper Wishbone Creek. Apparently some pellets were dropped  in the zone immediately above the treated area and affected the water  sample taken there. An increase in urea-nitrogen was noted the same  evening in Twenty-mile Creek itself, with the level rising from the trace  found May 19 to about 0.2 ppm.  4  By noon of May 21 ( the day after fertilizer was applied ), urea-nitro­gen  levels had dropped drastically, even Lower Wishbone Creek regis­tered  less than 0.3 ppm. There were only traces of urea-nitrogen found  in samples from all three sampling points on May 30. On June 7 and  again on December 19, urea-nitrogen in Lower Wishbone Creek was  found to be 0.3 ppm. The urea-nitrogen in Twenty-mile Creek remained  at a trace level, however.  :. 00  0. 75  -.E.. ... o. Su  0.00  Figure 1.  -- Low. Yli shbone Cr .  ------ Up.

Ammonium-nitrogen level in creeks of the Twenty-mile site was un­affected  by treatment. On no sampling date did analysis reveal more  than 0.1 ppm of this component.  Figure 2 illustrates graphicaily the status of nitrate-nitrogen in the  creeks on the various sampling elates. A rather erratic picture is presented  because factors other than the fertilizer treatment would affect this com­ponent.  Environmental conditions at a particular time will regulate the  rate of conversion of other compounds of nitrogen to nitrate in both soil  and water. Then too, some nitrate is brought to earth in precipitation.  Thus the increases in nitra te-nitrogen which occurred cannot readily be  attributed to treatment. It must be noted also, that the actual level of  nitrate-nitrogen, regardless of flu ctuations, never exceeded 0.25 ppm.  5  L_  0. 25  ' ...  E  a. 0.20  a.  •· ...  --Low.

Hollywood Site-At this location, it proved impossible to obtain water  samples prior to the day of fertilization (May 23 ). However, Upper  Quartz Creek, unaffected by treatment, showed only a trace of urea­nitrogen  when sampled after the operation (Figure 3). One can a ssume  that the urea-nitrogen levels in Creeks l and 2 and Lower Quartz Creek  would also have been minimal had no fertilization taken place. However,  the urea-nitrogen levels in these creeks were sharply higher than that  found for Upper Quartz Creek when sampled on May 23 shortly after  the urea had been dropped from the helicopter. The level in Lower  Quartz Creek was also high in comparison to that found for Upper  Quartz Creek. Again, pilot error resulting in direct placement of urea in  the streams was undoubtedly responsible for the values found. Within  a day or two, urea-nitrogen levels in the affected streams had decreased  markedly. On December 20, urea-nitrogen levels in Creek 2 and Lower  Quartz Creek approximated that of Upper Quartz Creek (practically  undetectable quantities), and Creek l registered 0.75 ppm. urea-nitrogen.  Only traces of ammonium-nitrogen were found in water samples col­lected  throughout the study period on the Hollywood site. No pattern  of nitrate-nitrogen accumulation which would relate to the fertilization  operation was found. The largest quantities of this component were de­tected  on December 20 ( Figure 4 ). On this date, a sample from Upper  Quartz Creek, which could not have been affected by the fertilizer treat­ment,  contained the most nitrate-nitrogen. Were fertilization a factor,  one would expect much higher nitrate-nitrogen values in samples from  the other collecting points.  6  1.7S  I. ~0  I. 25  I. 00  ..E....  z 0. 1 s  .&lt;.' .  :"":&gt;""  0. so  0.25  0. 00  Figure 3.

A sharp rise in urea-nitrogen level was  detected immediately after aerial fertilization on September 29 in sam­ples  taken near the spring (Figure 5). On the other hand, only a trace of  urea-nitrogen was found in water from Lower ;\lica Creek on the same  date. Three days later, urea-nitrogen in water from both sampling si tes  was a trace le,·el, and remained so throughout October.

Fertilizer was applied on September 29, 1972.  9  Discussion and Conclusions  On each of the fertilized sites, a sharp increase in urea-nitrogen in  creeks can be noted immediately after treatment. The higher levels were  maintained only briefly, and within a day or two a precipitous drop oc­curred.  1 he temporary increase can be attributed to fertilizer falling  directly into streams as it was dispensed from the helicopter, rather than  to runoff of material from the land surface. Closer attention to buffer  zones along water courses when fertilizing from the air would alleviale  this particular problem.  From the pollution standpoint, no significance or importance should  be attached to the short-lived rise in urea-nitrogen levels. The increase  only appears large in comparison to the base levels detected. In actual  quantity, urea-nitrogen in the most extreme example (Creek 1 on the  Hollywood site) did not e\·en reach 2 ppm. In studies made elsewhere,  minnows exposed to 17.1 ppm. urea-nitrogen for 24 hours were not af­fected  adversely (Calif. State Water Quality Board, 1963).  Ammonium-nitrogen in these waters presents no problem. In mo~t  samples this component was present only in trace amounts or else was  actually undetectable.  Considerable fluctuation in nitrate-nitrogen levels in water samples  was observed. \lost of these changes were minor, and cannot readily be  attributed to the treatment. They occurred even in Upper Quartz Creek,  for example, which was outside the fertilized zone at Hollywood. A host  of environmental factors (temperature, precipitation, etc.) act to influ­ence  the nitrate nitrogen level at any time. Again, as in the case of urea­nitrogen,  nitrate-nitrogen levels appear high in certain instances only  when compared to the extremely low base levels found in these waters.  Ten ppm. may be taken as the upper limit for nitrate-nitrogen in un­polluted  waters (Calif. State Water Quality Board, 1963). The quantity  of nitrate-nitrogen found in samples taken during the present study was  below the stated limit by a factor of at least 10, and in most cases the  factor ranged from 50 to almost 100.  In reference to the sum total of all forms of inorganic nitrogen allow­able  in waters classified as unpolluted, a figure of 10 ppm is again cited  ( Federal Water Pollution Control Administration, 1968 ). Analysis of  waters from the three si tes fertilized shows that on no sampling date  within the study period was this value eYen approached. In the light of  the data presented, it may be concluded that thus far these fertilization  operations have created no water pollution problem.  Summary  Urea, ammonium, and nitrate-nitrogen were monitored in samples  collected at intervals from streams on and adjacent to three forest sites  in northern Idaho. Two of these small watersheds were aerially fertilized  with urea at a rate of 200 lbs. nitrogen per acre in the spring of 1972;  the third was treated similarly in the fall of the same year.  10  A short-term increase of urea-nitrogen in water samples occurred  immediately after fertilization; this rise was attributed to direct place­ment  of urea in creeks through pilot error. Fluctuations of nitrate-nitro­gen  levels in water were observed, but these evidently were caused by  variations in the natural environment rather than by fertilizer treatment.  Inorganic nitrogen levels in creeks on all three sites remained well  within acceptable water purity standards throughout the study period.

Hofstrand  Station Paper No. 13  March, 1974  Abstract  Twenty-five transverse compression specimens for each of seven growth  ring orientations and for three moisture content levels were tested . Compression  perpendicular to grain was influenced by moisture content and growth ring  angle. Compression strength increased with decreased moisture content .  Compression strength decreased from maximum at 0° and 90° to a minimum at  45°.  Modulus of elasticity decreased with an increase in number of growth rings­per-  inch and increased with an increase in specific gravity.  TO CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS FLOOR  2  TRANSVERSE COMPRESSION  OF  INLAND DOUGLAS FIR 1  by  A . D. Hofstrand2  Although stress often is applied to wood at an angle perpendicular to the  grain. we know little about the action of such stresses within wood. Knowledge  of the reaction of wood to these stresses are of importance. not only in structural  design. but also to manufacturers of pressed panel products including plywood.  fiberboard. and particleboard.  Transverse compression can occur by a load being distributed over the entire  surface or concentrated over a portion of the specimen su rface. In the first  instance. the true resistance to simple crushing is obtained. Examples of this  type of load application are common to the manufacture of plywood and  laminated beams. In the latter. a post resting on a sill plate or a rail on a cross-tie  are examples of concentrated load. This latter condition also forms the basis for  making standard transverse compression tests (ASTM 1949).  For softwoods (conifers). the stress above which permanent damage  (proportional limit stress) occurs is about the same regardless of direction of  transverse compression (Anon 1958). However. several investigators maintain  there are differences between tangential and radial compression and that these  differences are functions of anatomic structure (Bazhenov. et. al. 1943; Bodig  1963. 1965; Ivanov 1953; Kunesh 1961. 1968; and Perelvgin 1965). Non­uniformity  of annual rings may cause conifers to have proportional limit stresses  50 percent greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction  (Perelvgin 1965). Bodig (1963) substar.tiated this generalization for Douglas fir.  but not for western red cedar. Several investigators attribute failure to the  crushing of fibers at the border for the annual ring ( Bodig 1963. Ivanov 1953.  and Vikhov 1953). The size and quantity of rays were found to increase both the  proportional limit stress and elastic properties in radial compression of  hardwoods (Bodig 1963. Kunesh 1961 . and Schniewind 1959). Characteristics  of the growth rings are critical in controlling transverse compression . The density  contrast between earlywood and latewood and the intermediate orientation of  growth rings between the radial and tangential positions influence the  compression perpendicular to the grain strength (Kollmann 1959). Results of  several investigations indicate that transverse compression is minimum at an  annual ring orientation of 45° to the direction of stress (Alexander and Smith  1950. 1951 ; Kennedy 1968; and Kollmann 1959).

Radial and tangential  loading are defined as application of load perpendicular and parallel to the  annual rings. I also studied how compressive stress was influenced by height in  the tree bole.  Method  A single Douglas fir. Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mish.) Franco. was selected.  The tree had a straight bole and nearly uniform circumference throughout the  bole length. Two-foot lengths were cut along the bole to the base of the live  crown. These two-foot lengths were end-coated to reduce moisture loss and  tagged as to position in the bole. Each two-foot section was further subdivided  into three 8 -inch sections. From each section. seven specimens representing ring  orientations (with respect to direction of load) of 0°. 15°. 30°, 45°. 60°, 7 5° and  900. respectively. were prepared. No attempt was made to match specimens  from each section as to specific gravity. rings-per-inch or position in the section's  cross-section. Also. no attempt was made to cut specimens from the outer  periphery of each section. although an attempt was made to reduce the degree  of curvature of the growth rings to a minimum. Test specimens from a given two­foot  section were randomly selected for testing at one of three moisture content  levels (green. 12% and 6%).  Individual specimens. 2 inches by 2 inches in cross-section and 6 inches  long. were compressed by a 2-inch wide plate placed on the central 2 inches of  the specimen. The compression load was applied at a rate of 0 .024 inch per  minute resulting in a rate of strain of 0 .012 inch per minute. Load-deformation  curves were recorded continuously on an X-Y strip-chart recorder. Specimens  were stressed until the maximum compression was 10 percent of the original  uncompressed thickness. This test procedure conformed to ASTM Standard D-  143-49 with the following exceptions: growth ring orientation varied . and  compression was carried beyond the normal 0 .1 inch compression .  Specific gravity (o.d . volume - o.d. weight). rings-per-inch and percent  latewood were measured on a small sect ion cut from each test specimen after  the compression test was completed . Percentage latewood was measured on  cross-sections using a microscope (Howe 1961 ). Mark's ( 1968) definition of  late wood was used to estimate percentage late wood .  Stress at the proportional limit. stress at maximum compression (maximum  stress). modulus of elasticity, rings-per-inch. percent latewood and specific  gravity were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance . Regression and  correlation analyses were made between the physical properties; rings-per-inch.  percent latewood. specific gravity and the mechanical properties; proportional  limit stress. maximum stress. modulus of elasticity.  4  Results and Discussion  Initially. I used two methods of measuring compression perpendicular to the  grain. The first suggested by Ivanov ( 1953) estimates strain of plastic flow by a  tangent line starting from the origin of the stress strain curve. I abandoned this  approach when it became apparent that the point of tangency was extremely  difficult to accurately pinpoint. Bodig ( 1963) found that he had the same  difficulty in determining the point of tangency. The second approach utilized the  standard ASTM method of finding the proportional limit strain (ASTM 1949). In  this method. the strain at proportional limit is measured from the extended  straight line section of the initial portion of the stress-strain curve .  The shape of the stress-strain curve in transverse compression is influenced  by the characterist ics and anatomy of the annual growth ring (Fig. 1 ). The slope  or ascent of the elastic curve was generally greatest at ring orientations 0° and  900 and the least at ring orientation of 45° to the applied load.

This agreed with results  obtained by a number of investigators.  Analysis of variance indicated extreme variability existed between  specimens for all properties measured (Table 1). Much of this variability was  expected since the method of specimen selection and preparation precluded  uniform test specimens. Also. within tree variations often are known to be  significant. Variability might have been reduced by matching test specimens.  Moisture content also significantly influenced the ability of wood to resist  transverse compression stresses (Table 1 ). Higher proportional limit stresses.  moduli of elasticity, and maximum stress values were found, when present for  any growth ring orientation. to be associated with lower moisture contents.  Moisture content level influenced modulus of elasticity in transverse  compression (Figs. 2, 3). A family of curves was generated having about the  same shape with the relative position of each curve related to a certain moisture  content level.  As moisture content decreased from above fiber saturation (green) to 12  percent, the average modulus of elasticity increased approximately 85 percent  and increased about go percent when moisture content level was decreased to 6  percent from the green condition . The increase in modulus of elasticity with  decreasing moisture content holds true regardless of growth ring orientation.  Moisture content also influenced proportional limit load and maximum stress  (Table 2). An increase of approximately 100 percent in proportional limit load  resulted from conditioning test specimens to 12 and 6 percent. respectively. For  maximum stress, increase in stress values averaged 87 and g1 percent at  moisture levels of 12 percent and 6 percent. respectively.  Examination of the proportional limit loads in Table 2 showed the existence  of an anomaly. The relationship between modulus of elasticity and proportional  limit stress is linear, other factors being equal. In this case. modulus of elasticity  showed a definite trend toward higher values when pressure was applied  perpendicular to the growth ring (g0°). The proportional limit load showed the  opposite trend . Higher proportional limit stresses were realized when pressure  was applied parallel to the growth rings (00) regardless of moisture content level.  Just why this anomalism occurred is not known.  As expected, the angle of the applied load to the growth ring had a  significant influence on modulus of elasticity, proportional limit. and maximum  stress. The average stress value decreased to a minimum when the applied  pressure was at an angle of 45° to the growth ring (Fig. 2, Table 2). The  percentage reduction in modulus of elasticity, based on the ultimate modulus of  elasticity, was 44. 47 and 57 percent for green, 12 and 6 percent moisture.  respectively . Average modulus of elasticity at the goo ring position was about the  6  .....  Table 1.

Transverse compression data were grouped within rings-per-inch, specific  gravity, and percent latewood classes and then analyzed by regression­correlation  techniques. Analysis of this data indicated the existence of several  relationships:  1. As the number of rings-per-inch increased there was a general tendency  for percent latewood. specific gravity, and the strength properties modulus of  elasticity. proportional limit stress. and maximum stress to decrease.  2. As specific gravity increased there was a trend toward increased  modulus of elasticity. However. this trend appeared to be influenced somewhat  by moisture content level with specimens tested at 12 percent exhibiting a  negative relationship between modulus of elasticity and specific gravity.  12  ..,  0 ..

There was a relatively strong re lationship between percent latewood and  specific gravity which was expected because the amount of cell wall substance  greatly influences specific gravity. Since the bulk of the cell wall substance is  located in the latewood portion of the growth ring. it is only natural to expect a  relationship to exist between specific gravity and late wood .  The relationship of modulus of elasticity to height in the bole is shown in  Figs. 4. 5. and 6 respectively. for specimens tested green. at 12 percent and at  6 percent. respectively. There was a general trend of decreasing modulus of  elasticity as height in the bole approached 20-30 feet and then increasing again  up to the base of the live crown. Since the test specimens were not matched at  time of preparation. this trend may be the result of coincidence and further  compression data are needed to establish the reliability of this trend.  13  Table 3.

Data were  analyzed by analysis of variance, and regession and correlation techniques .  Compression perpendicular to grain bearing load was influenced by the  moisture content. growth ring angle and the physical characteristics of the  specimen.  Compression strength increased as the moisture content decreased.  Approximately a two-fold increase in compression strength resulted in  conditioning from the green condition to 12 and 6 percent. respectively .  Compression load values decreased from highs at ()0 and 90° to a minimum  at 45°. This relationship held for the three levels of moisture used in this study.  Maximum modulus of elasticity was obtained when specimens were tested  at a 900 growth ring orientation (perpendicular to the direction of applied stress).  There was a trend toward decreased modulus of elasticity. stress at  proportional limit, maximum stress. specific gravity and percent latewood w ith  increased number of rings-per-inch.  There was a strong linear relationship between percent latewood and  specific gravity.  There was a trend toward increasing modulus of elasticity with increasing  specific gravity. However. this trend appeared to be influenced by the moisture  content.  There appeared to be a trend toward decreasing modulus of elasticity up to  20-30 feet and then an increasing trend up to the live crown of the bole.  Improved relationships between the physical and mechanical characteristics  and their influence on the transverse compression strength of Douglas fir may be  possible by using additional tree samples and by matching test specimens within  a given tree .  15  Literature Cited  Alexander.

Patee  INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this experiment was to obtain basic information on regional variation in the natural  population of ponderosa pine as a basis of selection for genetic improvement (Wang 1967). The wide  range of among-stand and among·progeny variations in the first 5-year period indicates that substantial  improvement could be expected from the first generation selection.  The region of this study includes six counties in southern Idaho, viz., Adams, Boise, Elmorc, Gem,  Idaho, and Valley. The materials were 271 half·sib famil ies from 37 natural stands. Each stand was  represented by 1 to 10 seed trees, selected at random from the dominant class, with the restrictions that  the sample trees were no less than 61 m (200 ft) apart, and that all trees in a stand were within a 1.609  km (l·mile) radius. Their geographic sources were tabulated in Appendix 1. The l·year and 2-year  growth and their relationship with seed characteristics were analyzed (Wang and Patee 1974). The  progenies were tested in four sites from 11 27.8 m (3700 ft) to 1630.7 m (5350 ft) within the natu ral range  of ponderosa pine of this region. The 12-acre plantation at each site includes 10 randomized cOfllllete  blocks of all the progenies in 4-tree plots at 5 ft x 10 ft spacing.  The four sites were located at (1) Boise County, 1219.2 m (4000 ft), Idaho City, U.S. Bureau of  Land Management plantation (2) Adams County, 1447.8 m (4750 ft), Boulder Creek, New Meadows,  Payette National Forest plantation (3) Valley County, 1630.7 m (5350 ft), Jack's Creek, Idaho State  Department of Public Lands, plantation and (4) Pda County, 1127.8 m (3700 ft), Holcomb, Boise  National Forest plantation. This is a report of the 5-year progeny variations, their correlation with seed,  seed-tree and seedling characteristics, and the progeny x site interaction .  This study was conducted in cooperation with the Idaho Department of Public Lands, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S.  Forest Service, and the Southern Idaho Forestry Association. It was partially supported by the Mcintire·Stennis fund, and was  published with approval of the Director, Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station, as Contribution No. 21, University of  Idaho, Moscow.

AMONG-STAND AND WITHIN-STAND VARIATION  The analysis of variance in the four sites showed  that the among-stand and among-progeny 5-year height  differences are highly sign ificant (Table 1). The five  fastest growing stands as indicated by the average 5-year  height on the four sites were (aJ stand no. 47, Garden  Valley, BNF, 79.58 cm (31.33 inch), (b) 21 A, Hazard  Creek, BLM, 79.22 cm (31.19 inch), (c) 42, Trail  Creek, BNF, 77.65 cm (30.57 inch), (d) 54, Zena  Creek, PNF, 76.61 cm (30.16 inch), and (e) 21 B,  Scriver Creek, BLM, 75.09 cm (29.56 inch).

For the analysis of within-stand variation, sample  trees within each stand are divided into substands  according to age at 10-year intervals. Age of parent  trees is given in Appendix 2. The within-stand  among-substand differences in 5-year height are not  significant (Tab le 2). Variance components attributable  to within-stand among-substand variations arc mostly  negligible (Table 3).  VARIANCE CDMPONENTS  AND POPULATION STRUCTURE  At site "" 48.65 percent of total variance and  site 4, 58.19 percent of total var iance in 5-year hei  were associated with stands; 25.20 percent {site  and 19.51 percent (site 4) of the total variance w  associated with progeny families. The among-progf  differences were highly significant (Tables 2, 3).  However, the analysis of variance of 5-year p  genies within each individual stand indicated that '  within-stand among-progeny differences were sign  cant only in 3 to 8 of the 35 mUlti-progeny star  (Table 4). Th is was a drastic change by comparison w  the 1-year and 2-year seedlings. At the 1-year stage, I  within-stand among-progeny differences were sign  cant in 31 of the 35 mUlti-progeny stands, and at I  2-year stage the among-progeny differences were sig  ficant in 32 stands. (Table 2, Wang and Patee 197  At this early stage of 5-year seedling height devel,  ment, a distinct pattern of population structure I  came evident. There was morc variation among star  than there was variation among mother trees witl  stand (Table 3) . There was no significant differer  among progenies from different age classes of tn  superimposed upon the same stand by natural regl  eration (Tab le 2). And in a re lat ive sense, the progen  from a common stand, i.e., a small panmictic pOpL  tion, were essentially uniform (Table 4) . Simi  results were obtained from among physiographic regie  and within-stand studies of loblolly pine (LaFarge 1 9~  Barber 1966, and Wells and Switzer 1971).

The  .year seedling height, as that of the 2·year seedling,  as inversely correlated with altitude and not  ignificantly correlated with latitude.  The four sites for the progeny tests plantations  ere in the granitic region of average site quality. They  ere selected to represent the altitudinal range in  hich ponderosa pine was to be planted. The  nvironmental influence of the test sites was reflected  progeny growth and the plantation means. The  rogeny site interaction of the 271 half-sib families  as highly significant(Table 1). The plantation mean  eight of the four sites were (1) 65.76 cm (25.89  nch). elevation 1219.2 m (4000 ft); (2) 77.95 cm  30.68 inch) at 1447.8 m (4750 ft); (3) 70.03 cm  27 .57 inch) at 1630.7 m (5350 ft); and (4) 64.74 cm  25.49 inch) at 1127.8 m (3700 ft).  In addition to their altitud inal range, there were  ther distinct differences between the four sites. Sites  and 4 were seriously affected by severe site  ondition, and site 2 by heavy snow. In view of the  trong site influence, both the over-aU performance of  their progenies at the four sites and their site  interaction should be taken into consideration in the  selection of superior seed trees.  3  DISCUSSION  Theoretically speaking it is logical to infer that  greater genetic gain can be expected from among-stand  selection than from within-stand among-progeny  selection. The 5-year result proved the veracity of this  approach.  Mean height growth was used as an indication of  vigor and general adaptability of the progeny families.  The 5-year result indicated that th is desirable character  was not distributed at random. In the natural  population, desirable parent trees were found to be  concentrated in certain local populations. Of the 20  best half-sib families, 8 families were from the best  two stands, and 14 families from the best five stands.  Table 4.

Tisdale2  INTRODUCTION  The forests of nor thern Idaho have a long history of recurring  wildfires. In 1883, over 1 mill ion acres were destroyed by the most  disastrous recorded fi re. More recent fires in 1910, 1919, 1929 and  1934 consumed another 2,240,000 acres (Thompson 1964).  These fires which destroyed millions of acres of timber led to the  development of vast brushfields that are now the main source of  winter feed for big game herds in the area. In the natural process  of plant succession after fire, however, tall shrubs such as bitter­cherry  (Prunus emarginata), willow (Sali.t: scouleriana), and Rocky  Mountain maple ( Acer glab'Y""U,m) grow out of reach of browsing  animals within several years after a burn. Shorter and less shade  tolerant shrubs such as redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus sanguineus)  are shaded out as the canopy of the taller shrubs grows denser.  Event ually, conifers will dominate the burned areas again, resulting  in a reduction of winter r ange capacity and big game numbers.  Fortunately, most of the shrubs preferred by elk and deer are  species that are fire-tolerant. They form sera! communit ies which  may be called ""fire types"" since they maintain themselves either by  stump or root-sprouting after fire, or by germination of hard coated  seeds that break dormancy due to the heat of the fire.  The use of prescr ibed burning to rehabilitate big game winter  range in northern Idaho was first investigated by the U.S. Forest  Service in 1960 (Brown 1966). Five years later, staff members of the  Clearwater National Forest a nd the Idaho Fish and Game Depart­ment  began an annual program of prescribed burning on the Clear­water  and Lochsa Rivers (Leege 1967). Although the response of  important browse species has been studied (Leege 1968 and 1969;  Hickey and Leege 1970), little information about the effects of pre­scr  ibed burning on the herbaceous vegetation or the soils had been  obtained prior to initation of the present project.  The objectives of this project were to determine the effects of  spr ing burning on (1) the shrubs and herbaceous understory of  sera! brush communit ies in key winter ing areas of the Lochsa River  drainage, and (2) the physical and chemical properties of the soils of  these sites.  I Publis hed with the approva l of the Director , Forest , Wildlife and Range Experiment Statio n,  Unive1·sity of Id aho, Moscow.

TO Cl RCU~ATE .SEE  LIBRARIAN Tt:I·S ·FlOOR  DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA  Two sites from among thirteen scheduled for burning in 1971  were selected to represent habitat types most commonly encountered  in the burning program. These sites were located along the Lochsa  River near the confluence of Holly Creek, approximately 33 miles  northeast of Lowell, Idaho (Fig. 1). Within the areas of the proposed  burns, six study plots were chosen on the basis of uniformity of  vegetation, soil, available fuel s, and aspect. Two control plots were  established outside the burn areas since it was too early to sample  the vegetation prior to the burning date of May 4, 1971.  The study area lies within the cedar/hemlock (Thuja plicata/  Tsuga heterophylla) zone (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968). The  present vegetation on relatively undisturbed sites in the Holly Creek  area indicated a habitat type transitional between the Thuja plicata/  Pachistima rnyrsinites and the Thuja plicata/Acliantum pedaturn  described by Steele (1971).  No year-round weather stations are maintained that directly  reflect conditions in the study area. Extrapolating from weather  stations located in similar habitat types and elevations in northern  Idaho, it is estimated that the mean annual precipitation lies be­tween  37 and 42 inches with a mean annual temperature between  42° and 49° F.  Igneous intrusive rocks of the Idaho batholith make up the  predominant parent material of the area. The soils developed from  these materials belong in the Inceptisol order that characteristically  indicates past colluvial and alluvial soil movement.  METHODS OF STUDY  A modification of the technique of Poulton and Tisdale (1961)  was used with macroplots 25 x 25 m in size for vegetational measure­ments  on all study plots. Three 1 x 25 m belt transects, each contain­ing  ten 20 x 50 em microplots, were used to estimate frequency and  cover of all species and the density of selected species. A list of all  species found on each macroplot was also prepared.  Photopoints were established at each macroplot to provide a  photographic record of the vegetation before and after the burning  treatment.  A soil core sampler, 2.5 em in length and 2.5 em in diameter,  was used to sample the surface 2.5 em of mineral soil in each marco­plot.  This was done just prior to burning, immediately after burning,  and in the late summer after the burning treatment. Surface samples  were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrate and am­monium  nitrogen, and percent organic matter.  Profile descriptions of soils from each macroplot were made in  the field in accordance with the Soil Survey Manual (Soil Survey  Canada  Wash.

Location of Lowell and the Loch sa River study area.  4  Staff 1962). Samples were taken from each horizon for laboratory  analysis and pedon classificat ion.  One hundred pyrometers made of 5 x 23 em pieces of asbestos  6.4 mm thick were used to record approximate soil surface tempera­tures  reached during burning. Depressions in each pyrometer con­tained  small pieces of "" tempilstic,"" representing melt ing point  ranges from 150° F . to 1,500° F .  Surface litter and other ground cover was sampled by the point  method. Five-hundr ed point determinations at ground level were  made for each macroplot.  Production of vegetation on burned and unburned sites was  compared by clipping ten 1.0 x 0.5 m plots by species at each of three  burned macroplot s and the two cont rol plot s.  Rates of plant recovery on burned plots were studied by means  of ten individually marked plants of each of several species. Per iodic  measurements of height and growth development were made on  t hese plants throughout the season.  RESULTS  The wildfires that swept through t he Holly Creek area in 1919  and 1929 (Norberg and Trout 1957) were highly destructive and  few areas along the Lochsa River retain t races of the forests that  ex isted befor e those fires. These and earlier wildfires a lso caused  significant changes in the so ils. The soil pedons described were  coarse loamy and loamy skeletal, mixed, mesic, typic Haplumbrepts  of the order Inceptisol. Such pedons indicate that a great amount  of soil movement had occurred since the removal of forest vegeta­tion,  especially on the steeper slopes. Older horizons buried beneath  colluvial deposits were found frequently in t he study area. Soils of  gently sloping areas were colluvial or alluvial in nature and rela­tively  young. Although soil materials had been in place long enough  for horizons to be differentiated by soil color, structure was not well  developed in the profiles examined.  Other indicators of soil instability observed in the area were  soil slips, colluvial or alluvial fans, and colluvial movement or dry  surface creep. A small amount of surface creep was observed on  steeper slopes even after prescribed burns.  Burning Intensity-Pyrometers placed in the fi eld prior to  ignit ion indicated the approximate surface soil temperatures reached  and the great variation in temperatures from spot to spot. In an  ext reme case, surface soil temperatures varied from less than 150°  F. to 1,050° F . within a distance of2.5 m. The overall intensity of the  burns conducted in the Holly Creek area was not high, since ground  temperatures at 23% of t he pyrometer pos itions were less than 150°  F. and at 51% were less than 250° F. Only two percent of the posi­t  ions indicated t emperat ures exceeding 1,000° F .  5  Of the six macroplots burned, sites 2 and 6 had the lowest burn­ing  temperatures. These sites had fuels comprised mainly of brush  and forb leaf litter and little or no bracken fern. In contrast, sites 4  and 5, with dense stands of old brush and fern, had much hotter fires.  Effects of Burning on Vegetation--The rate of recovery of vege­tation  after burning was spectacular: Bracken fern was foremost  in rate of r ecovery (Fig. 2). Immature fern stipes were observed  on burned plots within ten days after the burning treatment. During  their first three weeks of growth, tagged bracken fern plants averaged  approximately 0.5 inches of growth per day. At the end of six weeks,  the mean height of the ferns were 31.8 inches, or approximately 99%  of their maximum growth. During the second three weeks, the ferns  grew approximately one inch per day.  Regrowth rates for 60 days, based on mean heights of randomly  selected plants, were also calculated for thimbleberry (Rubus parvi­florus),  spiraea (Spiraea betulifolia), and rose (Rosa gymnocarpa)  occurring on two burned sites. On the more severely burned site,  mean growth rates were 0.25, 0.11, and 0.21 inches per day  respectively for these species. Growth rates on the less severely  burned sites were lower except for Apocynum androsaemifolium  which increased its average dail y growth rate. St udies by Leege  (1967, 1968, 1969) indicate that other important browse species such  as willow, bittercherry, Rocky Mountain maple, and redstem  ceanothus also have rapid regrowth rates.  Vegetational production was compared for the three sites that  r eceived the most severe burning treatments and the control plots.  Results indicate that burning was not harmful to subsequent shrub  or forb production on the sites sampled. Burned sites had a mean forb  production of 1,237.6 lbs. per acre compared to a mean of 1,170.6 lbs.  on the controls. Shrub production on the burned plots averaged  940.5 lbs. per acre while controls had a mean of 766.5 pounds. Total  shrub production on the control plots was underestimated, however,  since only those por t ions of shrubs considered available t o browsing  animals were harvested.  Graminoid production was detrimentally affected by the higher  burning temperatures, but Canada bluegrass ( Poa compressa) re­covered  well on lightly burned s ites. Graminoid regrowth averaged  only 0.7 pounds/acre on two of the burned plots compared to an  average of 10.2 pounds/acre on the control plots. On the third burned  plot, where the fire was less severe, vigorous regeneration of Canada  bluegrass resulted in a graminoid yield of 135 pounds/acre.  A combination of frequency, cover, and density data was used  to determine the response of a particular plant species to fire. The  approximate intensity of the burning treatment on each site and the  amount of vegetation production was also considered. Since the  response to burning of the taller browse species of the Lochsa River  6  Figure 2. Transect sequence showing mosaic pattern of burning (a) and amount  of regrowth on the same site after sixty days (b).  7  area had been studied previously, emphasis was placed upon the  reaction of lower growing shrubs and herbaceous plants.  Thimbleberry, spiraea, and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus)  were observed for response to various intensities of burning. Of these  low shrubs, only thimbleberry seemed to be benefited by the higher  intensity burning treatments. Fire of light intensity seemed to bene­fit  snowberry on gently sloping alluvial fans. The response of spiraea  to fire was difficult to determine since its highest combinations of  cover, frequency, and density occurred on sites with widely different  intensities of burning. The frequency and cover of spiraea was  highest on control sites, but density on burned plots appeared to be  twice that of control plots. This increase in numbers of shoots may  be misleading, since what appeared to be two or three plants in the  early stages of sprouting were often found to be connected below  the soil surface.  Intensity of burning apparently did not affect bracken fern on  the Holly Creek sites. The rhizomes of this species are located too  deep in the soil to be affected by the burning temperatures generated.  Both strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and goatweed (Hypericum  perforatum) were important forbs on the burned areas. Both species  increased following low intens ity burning but nei ther benefited when  the treatment was more intense. Strawberry appeared to have an  important stabilizing influence on the surface soils of the steeper  slopes, since it was abundant after burning and sent out numerous  stolons.  Effects of Burning on Soils--Prescribed burning had  its most noticeable effect on the surface characteristics of the soils  of the study area. Surface litter was reduced, but even the most  intense burning treatment did not consume all of it (Fig. 3). The six  burned sites had a mean of 70% litter remaining after treatment  compared to a mean of 92% on the two control plots (Table 1). The  macroplot that received the most severe burning treatment still  retained 55.8% litter and 3.6% live vegetation for a total of 59.4%  cover at ground level.  Data obtained by Packer (1951) and Meeuwig (1969) indicate  that a combined cover of 70 to 90% of live plants, rock, and litter  appears necessary to protect the surface of highly erosive soils. In  the Holly Creek area, regrowth of vegetation on the six burned sites  brought total cover, including rock, to an average of 79% within 3  months after burning. This level approximates those set by Packer  and Meeuwig and indicates that the burned plots were reasonably  well protected during fall and winter when the bulk of the annual  precipitation occurs. A check of the study area approximately one  year after burning showed no evident so il erosion.  Burning produced less obvious effects in the chemical character­istics  of the soils. Significant changes in nitrate nitrogen, pH, and  8  Table I.

Prior to burning, the control macroplots tended to be higher in  nitrate nitrogen than the proposed burn sites. The latter had a mean  of 160 ppm nitrate nit rogen compared to 267 ppm on the controls.  The trend throughout th e sampling period was towards lower nitro­gen  levels on all sites. By late September the burned plots had a  mean of 31.4 ppm nitrate nitrogen while the control plots had  dropped to a mean level of 2.9 ppm. This difference is highly signi-  Figure 3.

It appears that the burned sites will have higher  levels of nitrate nitrogen available for plant growth the following  spring than do comparable unburned areas.  Changes in electrical conductivity indicated that prescribed  burning affected amounts of ash and soluble cations in the surface  mineral soils. Electrical conductivity responded to burning in a  manner similar to nitrate nitrogen and was found to be significant ly  lower on all plots at the end of the sampling period. Proposed burn  plots and control plots had mean conductivities of 1.53 and 1.83 re­spectively  prior to spring burning. By late September, the burned  plots had a mean conductivity of 0.50 while the controls mean level  had dropped to 0.24. Evidently, the burned areas had a higher  nutrient level at the end of the growing season, presumably due to  ash from the burn.  PH of surface soil on the burned sites averaged 5.85 compared to  5.65 for the controls when all were sampled shortly sfter the fire.  Increases in pH during the summer occurred on all plots, however,  and by September the average was 6.56 for the burned plots and  6.67 for the controls : These pH values, even in the spring, did not  indicate a degree of acidity likely to inhibit most plant species.  CONCLUSIONS  The results of this study, within the limits of time and replica­tion  inherent in a one-year, one-man project, support the current  practice of prescribed burning for improvement of big game range  in the Lochsa-Selway area. The vegetation r esponded well to the  fire treatment, with removal of much of the older shrub growth, and  a high percentage of recovery for most of the plant species involvoo.  All of the major shrub species and most of the forbs survived well.  Only the graminoids, with the except ion of Poa compressa, showed  a general decrease due to burning.  The other major concern in a program of prescribed burning is  that of detrimental effects on soil. Considerable evidence was obtained  of soil erosion due to past wildfires in the general study area. This  is to be expected in a region of steep slopes and erosive soils. On the  other hand, no such effect was observed on the prescribed burns in­cluded  in the present study. The major reason appeared to be the  relat ively low intensity of burn which results from burning in the  spring of a site with relatively limited fuel supply. The combination  of high soil moisture with relat ively low air temperatures existing  at the t ime of these burns resulted in a large residue of unburned  litter, and a high rate of survival for the live vegetation. The rapid  rat e of regrowth for most plant species was another factor favoring  soil stability. The above factors seemed to be of prime impor tance  in preventing soil erosion, and need to be carefully considered in  any future prescribed burning in the area.  10  LITERATURE CITED  Brown, R.

PATEE &lt;2&gt;  INTRODUCTION  The correlation between seedling characteristics and later performance  is of great importance in selective breeding of forest trees. Observation of 271  open-pollinated progeny families of ponderosa pine showed that the 1-year  and 2-year seedl ing height was positively correlated with their 8-year height  (Wang and Patee 1973). However, 1-year and 2-year seedling height was  found to be correlated with seed size, seed weight and germination capa­city.  This report presents an analysis of seed and seedling characteristics of  the open-pollinated progeny families and their interrelationship. The fac­tors  examined included their among-stand and among-progeny differences,  the latitude, altitude, soil types of seed origin, and height and age of the  seed trees.  MATERIALS AND METHOD  Seeds of 271 open-pollinated trees were collected in the same year from  37 natural stands in six counties of southern Idaho, viz., Adams, Boise, El­more,  Gem, Idaho, and Valley. Each stand was represented by 1 to 10 trees.  The seedlings were raised in regular nursery seed bed. The progeny families  were arra nged in the seed bed according to the randomized complete-block  design with 4 replicates.  In the analysis of variance the among-progeny differences was analysed  at both the within-stand and the within-substand levels. The substands  within each stand were separated according to the age of mother trees at  1 0-year intervals. Thus the mathematical model is as follows:  X --kl = V +B -+S. +Tk +P -kl+R ""kl I) m z .7 J J IJ m  i= [ . . . . 4,] = 7 . . 37, k -= [ . .. -~"" 1-: [ . .. .

Among the 37 stands  studied 2 stands (nos. 17 and 51) are 1-tree stands, and 5 stands (nos. 20A,  208, 23, 24, and 38) are even-aged.

The progeny family means of 1-year and 2-year seedling  height are listed in T able 9 (p. 9 ) and the stand means together with their  relative ranking in comparison with the 8-year values in Table 1. The range  of height between the shortest 2-year progeny family and the ta llest was 7.25  - 14.78 em (coeficient of variation 10.71, mean 10.65 em) and that of 1-year  progeny families 3.30-6.47 em (C = 10.4 1, mean 4.66 em).  The major sources ol va riation at the 1-year and 2-year stages were  among stands and among progeny families within each stand . (Table 2)  The within-stand variance was further partitioned into subst3nds ac­cording  to age of the mother trees. At the !-year stage the within-stand seed­ling  height differences attributable to differences among age groups of  mother trees were negligible, and the differences were non-significant at the  2-year stage (T able 2). This suggests that the succession of populations su­perimposed  upon the same stand were not significantly different so far as ob­served  in the seedling stage.  The general trend toward the 5-year and 8-year stage was that the differ­ence  in height between stands became increasingly distinct, and that the  difference within stand among progeny families became increasingly uniform  (Wang and Patee 1973).  THE VARIATION IN SEED CHARACTERISTICS  The seed characteristics analyzed included seed length, seed width, seed  weight, and germination capacity. For seed size data length and width  measurements were made with 10 individual random seeds for each progeny  family, for seed weight data one measurement of a 40-seed sample was made  for each progeny family. Equal amount of seed was sowed for each progeny  family. The number of seedlings produced at the end of the first growing  season was used as a measure of germination capacity.  The seed characteristics had a wide range of variation. The tree means  are listed in Table 9. The range of seed length was 6.5 1 - 10.33 mm (cof­fi  cient of variation 7 .58, mean 8. 15 mm), seed width 4.01 - 5. 92 mm (C =  6.38, mean 5.02 mm), and 40-seed weight 1.05 - 3.09 gram (C = 17.24,  mean 2.09 gram). The m_ajor source of seed size variation was in the among­progeny  differences within the natural stands (Table 3). There were no  significant among-stand differences in seed length. The among-stand dif­ferences  in seed width is significant at the 5% level.  In seed weight and germanation capacity the among-stand difference  was one of the major sources of variation . (Tables 4-5 ). Furthermore, seed  weight was the most variable of seed characters. It was positively correlated  with germination capacity and seed size (T able 6). But there was no signifi­cant  correlation between germmatiOn capacity and seed size (Table 6).  This divergent pattern of variation in seed characteristics confirmed  the distinct embryogeny and seed development of the genus Pinus. At the  time of fertilization about the end of June to early July over a year after  pollination, the seed were fully grown in size though somewhat succulent.  The seed coat hardened in a few days after fertilization but there was no ap­preciable  increase in seed size. The seed developed rapidly during the period  of embryonic differentiation in which the embryo enlarged rapidly and dif-ferentiated  its organs in a 10 to 12-day period. (Buchholz 1946, Buchholz  and Stiemert 1946).  Control pollination of reciprocal crosses of ponderosa pine made by the  senior author indicated that the inheritance of seed size was materna l. The  seed weight, however, was obviously influenced by the environmental condi-tion  of the critical 2-week period of embryonic differentiation after fert ili-zation  and the subsequent period of seed maturation. The among-stand  differences in seed weight and germination capacity reflected the essentially  more uniform environmental conditions exposed to seed trees within the  same stand in the same year in comparison with those among different  stands at different locali ties.

RELATIONS BETWEEN SEED, SEEDLING AND  THE MOTHER TREE  We then examined the relations between the variation in seed and seed­ling,  and the geographical and morphological differences of the mother  trees. The factors examined includ~d the age and height of the mother  trees, the soil types and the latitude and altitude of the original stands.  (1) AGE AND HEIGHT OF THE MOTHER TREES  The age of the mother trees varied from 20 to 200 years and the height  from 20 to 130 ft.  Correlation analysis indicated that age of the mother trees was not  significantly correlated with seed length, seed width, seed weight, germina­tion  capacity, and 1-year and 2-year seedling height. Height of the mother  tree was not significantly correlated with the 2-year seedling height and the  germination capacity. But the analysis based on this limited regional ma­terial  suggested that taller trees produced smaller and lighter seeds, and  shorter 1-year seedlings (Table 7).  Table 7.

In the planning of this program one of the major concerns  of the cooperators was the differences in soil types of this 6-county area.  Among the 271 seed trees selected, 113 trees in 15 natural stands were  from the ""basaltic"" bed rock soil regions and 158 trees in 22 natural stands  from the ""granitic"" region. No significant difference was found between trees  of these two regions in seed length, seed width, seed weight, germination  capacity, and 1-year and 2-year seedling height (Table 8).  Table 8.

The seed cha r­acteri  stics, and the seedling heights were not siginificantly correlated with  the latitude of seed origin (T able 7).  Of all the factors examined the correlation between the altitude of seed  origin and seed and seedling variation was the most significant. The seed  trees had a wide altitudinal range of 3200 to 6500 feet. The seed germination  capacity and the 1-year and 2-year seedling height were inversely corre­lated  with the altitude of seed origin. This general trend was found to be  highly significant (Table 7). But elevations alone was not a reliable criterion  for the selection of best progenies. As indicated by the 1-year, 2-year and 8-  year height growth, the tallest and the shortest progeny families and stands  were all from the broad zone of intermediate elevations.  SUMMARY  The among-stand difference was one of the major sources of variation in  seed weight and germination capacity, but in seed length, seed width, the  primary sources of variation was in the among-progeny difference within  the natural stands.  The major sources of variation of seedling height were among stands, and  among progeny families within each stand. The within-stand variance was  further partitioned into substands according to the age of mother trees. The  within-stand among-substand height differences were not significant in 2-  year seedlings.  Seedling height growth was found to be positively correlated with seed  length, seed width, seed weight and germination capacity, but there was no  significant correlation between germination capacity and seed size. Age  and height of mother trees were not significantly correlated with germina­tion  capacity, and 2-year seedling height. No significant differences were  found between progeny families from the basaltic and the granitic regions in  seed fength, seed width, seed weight, germination capacity and 1-year and 2-  year seedling height. Seed and seedling cha racteristics were not significantly  correlated with the la titude of seed origin.  The inverse correlation between seedling height and altitude of seed  origin was found to be highly significant, but the fastest and the slowest  growing progeny families and stands were all from the broad belt of middle  elevations.

Allen2  INTRODUCTION  Periodic t hinnings are desirable in most conifer forests of  Northern Idaho to enhance quality and quantity production of wood  products. Removal of a portion of the immature forest through thin­nings  not only provides an opportunity to utilize material which  would otherwise be lost due to natural mortality, but also serves to  distribute the growth potential of the site among the more desirable  residual trees (2) (5).  Most of the timber types in the Northern Rocky Mountain and  Intermountain regions tend to overstock. In many cases of severe  overstocking, total growth capacity may be dissipated on so many  stems that few, if any, will grow large enough to be usable by cur­rent  standards. Wikstrom and Wellner aptly described the anomaly  facing forestry in this area: ""unless we deal effectively with the  matter of sheer numbers of trees, the very prolificness of nature  will sharply limit future timber yields"" ( 4).  In stands that stagnate (a common problem in the lodgepole  pine type), thinning will increase both the total yield and the yield  of utilizable wood. While thinning in non-stagnating stands does not  increase total wood yield, it does concentrate the growth on fewer  trees, thereby resulting in larger volumes of utilizable wood. An  additional beneficial effect of thinning is to reduce the time required  to grow crop trees by assuring optimal site occupancy.  Greatly increased harvest values can be created by thinning.  For example, by thinning well-stocked larch stands on good sites,  we can more than double their value. On poor sites, thinning can  increase the final harvest value four times (4). Thinning is not  currently a high priority forestry practice in this region largely  because of inadequate financing (1, 3, 4). Thinnings that are made  in young second-growth stands in Northern Idaho are usually of a  ""precommercial"" nature; in other words, it is not possible to sell the  material removed to defray the costs of the operation. Therefore,  desirable cultural measures are either not done at all or delayed  until the residual trees are too old to exhibit significant growth r e­sponse  to the t reatment.  A private sawmill owner in Sandpoint, Idaho designed a port­able  mill which is being used to produce rough cut 2 by 4's, 2 by 3's  ' Published with the approval of the Director, Forest, Wildlife nnd Range Experiment  Station, University of Idaho, Moscow.

TO CIRCULATE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS FLOOR  and 2 by 2's from logs with small-end diameters from 3 to 7 inches.  This mill utilizes four planer heads operated by hydraulic motors  to convert round wood material to cants or rough dimension lumber.  A circular saw is mounted directly behind t he head rigs for ripping  cants to produce two pieces. Another similar small-log mill is being  manufactured by a firm in Washington. The availability of this  type of equipment coupled with the rise in lumber prices, could  dramatically alter the complexion of thinning opportunities in  Northern Idaho, as well as in much of t he Intermountain West.  This may occur by changing costly ""precommercial"" thinnings (or  none at all) to ""commercial"" thinning opportunities with immediate  financial r eturns.  Limited experience has indicated thinning costs ranging from  $40 to over $80 per acre for operations in 30- to 80-year-old stands  in Northern Idaho.' Such expenditures by small private owners are  difficult to justify even though significant long-term benefits can  be expected. Likewise, public agencies often avoid the high per­acre  costs of thinning these stands. Cultural monies are often spent  instead on less expensive thinnings in juvenile stands, even though  the silvicultural desirability may not be as gr eat.  THE STUDY  The college of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences was re­quested  to monitor a thinning in conjunction with utilization of the  thinning material in lumber manufacture by t he Don Diehl Mill in  Bonner County, Idaho. The t hinning done was of a type usually de­scribed  as ""precommercial."" Since the average stand diameter was  only 5.4 inches most of the stems removed were too small to be  considered commercial by present utilization standards except for  a limjted roundwood market. The purpose of this study was to  obtain production data from an ongoing operation so that timber­land  and mill owners would have some init ial baseline information  on t he possibilities for commercial, or at least less costly, thinnings  in young stands. A 20-acre stand of state-owned timber near Athol,  Idaho and the portable mill developed by Diehl of Sandpoint were  t he bases for t his case study. Minimum stumpage and t he usual  slash disposal fees were charged by the State of Idaho Department  of Public Lands. The logging crew sold the 8-foot logs to the mill.  The 75-year-old stand was thinned and the r esulting material was  followed through the mill to determine the lumber production ob­tainable  from the kind of t hinning needed on many acres of North­ern  Idaho timberland.  The study consisted of three parts ;  1. An inventory was made of all t rees on t he 20-acre study  plot before and after thinning. As a part of the inventory  process a series of permanent growth plots was established  which will be used to study the long-run effects of the thinning.  3 Personal communications with U.S. Forest Service pe~-son n e l and thinn inK contractor-s in  Northern Idnho.  3  2. A study was made of the logging operation; the times re­quired  to perform each portion of the process were recorded  along with the log production. The local 3-man logging crew  which contracted to thin the area was given minimal instruc­tions.  They were asked to operate in much the same fashion  as in other thinnings that they perform. The instructions were  to remove diseased, insect-infested, malformed trees, and to  reduce crowding. Douglas-fir was to be favored in t his mixed  stand and western larch trees were to be specifically removed  because of larch case bearer infestation. Well-formed crop trees  were to be left on an average spacing of 18 feet.  3. An analysis was made of the milling process and the fin­ished  products were tallied.  RESULTS  Presented on the following pages are the data obtained from  carefully monitoring the entire process from initial stand inventory  through the manufacture of lumber from the trees removed in the  thinning. The results of this one case study certainly cannot be  expected to provide all the data necessary to properly evaluate such  a venture. However, the following production information should be  of value in analyzing the feasibility of a harvesting and manufac­turing  system for accomplishing needed thinning with utilization of  the thinned material for lumber production.  Stand Inventory  The 75-year-old stand had mixed species composition with  Douglas-fir comprising 55% of the basal area. Lodgepole pine with  24% of the basal area and grand fir with 16% were also important  in the stand composition. Western larch, ponderosa pine, western  white pine and western hemlock were present in lesser amounts.  Radial increment, as determined from borings of crop trees, had  been very slow for the past 25 to 30 years, averaging 20 rings to  the inch. The site quality was medium for Douglas-fir with a Site  Index of 50 feet at 50 years.  Table I is a summary of stand data compiled from 100% in­ventories  made before and after the thinning. As shown in the  table, 189 stems were removed per acre resulting in a 34% reduc­tion  in basal area and 33% removal of total cubic volume.  Logging Operation  A three-man logging crew worked 25 days on this thinning  operation. The average working day, including breaks and down  time was 8Y2 hours. The system usually followed was for two of  the crew to fall and limb trees for the first half of the day and to  buck and stack for the second half. The third man skidded with a  horse the full day. The stand thinned was on nearly level terrain  and there was an adequate haul road through the area.  On randomly-chosen days during the logging period careful  stop-watch checks and production tallies were made on each part  4  Table I.

These samples were for one-half day periods.  Average daily production for the three-man crew was 106 trees  which amounted to 387 cubic feet or 5.3 cords.  An analysis of the woods operation indicated the following:  Skidding production (one man and one horse)  82% of skidding was by 1-tree turns  18% of t urns included 2 or 3 trees  Average skid distance one way = 88 feet  Average time per turn = 3.2 minutes  (not including down time and breaks)  Average length of log skidded = 35 feet  Average number of turns per day = 91 (1log)  7 (2 or 3 logs)  Total turns per day = 98  Falling production (two fallers)  Average number of trees cut, limbed, bucked and stacked  per man/ day = 53  Daily production per man = 193 cubic feet or 1.8 cords  Average DBH of trees cut= 6.3 inches  Average height of trees cut= 49 feet  As indicated above the 3-man crew felled, limbed, skidded,  bucked, and stacked an average of 106 trees per working day. Since  the average tree contained four 8-foot logs, this amounted to 424  logs per day. Production per day for the crew was 0.8 acre.  Distribution of time among the logging activities listed above  is shown in Table II. These activities together accounted for 51.8%  of the average working day. The remaining time was used for  equipment maintenance and repair, breaks, decision time, walking,  haul-road clearing, and site preparation. Column 3 in the table  expresses the time distribution on the basis of one man-day. This  column indicates that 4.41 hours were spent performing these tasks  in an 8Y2 hour-day r esulting in a production of 35.3 trees and 141.3  logs per man.  Table II.

Table III shows the actual mill-yard sort for the 8384 logs that  were trucked to the Diehl Mill. Although the Diehl mill is portable  and can be taken to the harvest area, it was operated at a station­ary  set-up north of Sandpoint, Idaho for the duration of this study.  At the mill site the incoming logs were decked in a storage yard.  Logs were then moved to the mill as needed with a fork-lift truck.  The logs were hand sorted to comply with the small-end diameter  specifications given below. The mill was set to produce a given size  of lumber and the appropriate supply of sorted logs was fed into  the mill by hand.

In fact,  for the above data the larger logs were actually processed slightly  faster than the smaller ones. This was probably due to factors  other than machine capacity. The production rates shown here do  not reflect ""down"" time, but only the production rates while the  mill was actually operating. At this mill operation a significant  portion of the observed down time was related not to the mill itself,  but to peripheral equipment such as the fork-lift. At the feed rate of  4.5 logs per minute the 6481 logs supplied to the mill by this thin­ning  could theoretically have been processed in about 24 hours of  mill time. This clearly shows that several logging crews are needed  to keep the mill supplied.  The mill tally of board products manufactured from thinning  material at the Diehl mill is shown in Table VII. The 37,529 board  feet scaled in stud logs represents a total of 52,594 board feet of  lumber. This is 2630 board feet of lumber products removed per  acre. At an assumed wholesale rate of $110 per thousand this is a  lumber value of $289.30 per acre resulting from material that  might otherwise be left in the woods.  Table VII.

As was mentioned previously, mini­mal  instructions were given to the thinning crew prior to cutting;  therefore, it could not be expected that the results would fit a text­book  example. It should be noticed from Table I that the average  diameter was decreased due to cutting. This would indicate a thin­ning  from above rather than from below. Low thinning would be  more desirable in a situation like this if one were managing for  optimal production at maturity. However, although the average  diameter for the entire stand was slightly decreased, the average  diameter of Douglas-fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine and western  white pine, the favored species, was increased thus indicating  large crop trees were in fact favored in the desirable species.  It should be remembered that the logging crew was contracted  by the cord and would obviously be biased toward cutting larger  9  ---------------- ---- - - - - ~ --  trees for production purposes and leaving the low volume small trees.  This could possibly be overcome by marking before cutting or pen­alizing  the crew for taking obvious crop trees.  Woods production rates on similar operations would undoubt­edly  vary considerably from the production in this study.  It should be noted that the logging crew was not very experi­enced  and had been in the business only a short time before this  specific operation. This probably accounts for the high amount of  down time in the woods.  From the data presented, it is obvious that the mill potential  for production, about 18,000 board feet per 8 hour day, is quite  good. To make maximum use of t his potential, it is essential that  the entire operation be coordinated and scheduled very carefully.  One of the primary problems was in keeping an even steady flow  of logs from the cold deck area into the mill. A similar problem  could easily exist if the mill were operating in the woods. Since  this was a new operation, the people involved did not have any pre­vious  data to base decisions upon and had to run on ""intuition.""  As time progresses and more information becomes available, the  operators should be able to increase total production to the daily  potential of the mill by assuring a constant flow situation, rather  than a piece-meal operation.  The tendency for the sorters to put marginal logs into the next  higher classification seemed to result in more lumber down-grade  than necessary. On the other hand, some logs which fell below the  minimum diameter for a class produced the indicated lumber for the  class. This would infer that some adjustment in product class sizes  could be made.  Placing a dollar value on material as it stands in the woods  (stumpage price) becomes very difficult mainly because of the un­stable  nature of the lumber market. One approach is to consider  the thinning operation as strictly a silvicultural treatment and  assume the stumpage price to be zero. In this case, the only con­sideration  is that the revenues must be great enough to equal the  costs incurred. From the woods standpoint, the contract loggers  were paid $15 per cord stacked at roadside. Assuming 80 pieces of  material per cord, and 324 pieces per acre gives $60.75 that can be  incurred in the thinning operation and still break even, considering  only the material used by the small-log mill. There also were 103  stud logs per acre, or a total of 15,065 board feet of stud material  for the entire 20-acre tract. The woods crew was being paid $30.50  per cord for Douglas-fir and larch, and $25.50 for other species  stacked at roadside. At the rate of 38 stud logs per cord this is  $76.15 for stud material per acre. Added to the value of the small  mill material, this gives a total of $136.90 per acre that could be  incurred in the thinning operation and still break even.  Although this project was only a case study, and may there­fore  lack wide applicability, some general impressions can be stated.  The entire process appears to have merit if handled efficiently. Un­doubtedly,  the reason for decline of small operations in the north  10  Idaho region must be partially due to inefficient management. Sim­ilarly,  this relatively low volume operation may also incur financial  difficulties if not managed for maximum efficiency.  SUMMARY  Thinning a 75-year-old mixed composition stand to favor about  135 crop trees per acre produced 103 stud logs and 324 smaller logs  per acre from which lumber was manufactured. This material had  a roadside value in the woods of $136.90 per acre at time of harvest.  Another 10 logs per acre were processed in the woods which were  not suitable for lumber manufacture, but which might normally  reach some other kind of market. It appears from this case study  that such stand improvement measures will not only pay for them­selves  but can result in early income to the landowner and make  better utilization of the timber resource.

Norman, H. Loewenstein and F. H. Pitkin2  INTRODUCTION  Grand fir (Abies gmndis (Dougl.) Lindl.) was considered  economically unimportant in America until the 1950's. Since then,  decreased emphasis on management of western white pine (Pinus  monticola (Doug I.)) because of blister rust has focused attention  on the favorable attributes of grand fir.  Grand fir has fast growth, a straight uniform bole, and high  wood quality for both pulp and lumber. Additionally, grand fir  makes a superior Christmas tree. In the western white pine region  of the Inland Empire, grand fir is second only to white pine as a  high yielding species. In the overstory grand fir growth is nearly  equal to the more intolerant white pine and Douglas fir (Pseudo­tsuga  menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) with which it is com­monly  associated. As an understory tree, grand fir usually out­grows  the more tolerant western hemlock (Tsuga hete1·ophylla  (Ref.) Sarg.) and western red cedar (Thttja plicata Donn) (Foiles,  1959) .  Grand fir often survives poorly when transplanted to the field  from nursery beds, but natural regeneration usually produces  more than adequate seedling survival and stocking. Because grand  fir is shade tolerant, an important determinant of early develop­ment  on planting sites may be the degree of light intensity to which  seedlings are subjected.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of several  levels of shade on planted grand fir seedlings. Both a greenhouse  and a field experiment were involved in the investigation.  PROCEDURES  Greenhouse Experiment  Three-year-old grand fir seedlings were planted in wax coated  fiberboard tubes (one seedling per tube) twenty-four i.nches deep  and four inches in diameter. These tubes were lined with poly-  ' This project was partially supported with funds provided by the Mcintire­Stennis  Act.  • Former graduate assistant and professors of forestry, respectively.  2  TO CIRCULATE SEE  U3RARIAN THIS FLOOR  ethylene bags, the bottoms of which were perforated to permit  drainage. The potting medium consisted of a 1 :1 :1 mixture of  coarse sand, peat moss and silt loam soil. Watering schedules  were arranged to provide adequate moisture levels at all times, r e­gardless  of shade treatment. Greenhouse temperature was main­tained  at 78°F.  In t his experiment shade was provided by plastic screening  (Shadescreen) of varying mesh size suspended above the green­house  bench. Treatment ranged from full light intensity (no shad­ing  material) to 90ro shade; each situation involving 20 seedlings.  Natural daylight was supplemented by fluorescent Gro-lux light  bulbs, controlled by an electric timer. Day length was held at  twelve hours for two months, then extended to sixteen hours for  the rest of the experiment period (approximately four more  months). Actual light intensity under each treatment was mea­sured  in foot candles with a Spectra Candella X-100 light meter.  Light quality or intensity of each wave length from 380 mu (milli­microns)  to 750 mu was measured under each treatment with an  Isco Spectroradiometer (model SR).  Each month photosynthetic and respiratory activity of two  seedlings from each treatment was determined in a closed system  utilizing a Beckman model 1R-215A infra-red analyzer. Results  were calculated as ( 1) ppm C02 absorbed and released per plant  per ten minute period, and (2) ppm C02 absorbed and r eleased per  milligram of tissue per minute.  After photosynthesis and respiration rates were r ecorded, the  seedlings were removed from the potting medium. Length of new  shoot growth, new root length, and number of new roots were de­termined.  The seedlings were then oven-dried at 70° centigrade for  twenty-four hours, and weights of new topwood, new roots, and  new needle tissue were recorded. Treatment effect on survival and  percent of seedlings breaking bud was also ascertained.  Field Experiment  The site of this experiment was a 5 degree east-facing slope  approximately five miles west of Potlatch, Idaho. The area sup­ports  a mixture of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponde1·osa Laws), Doug­las  fir, and grand fir with an understory of ninebark (Physoca?·­pus  malvaceus), snowberry (Symphm·ocm·pus albus), and ocean  spray (Holidiscus discolm·). Twelve plots, each twenty-four feet  long and eight feet wide were marked out in two rows of six plots  each. Three-year-old grand fir (bare root stock) of a local prove­nance  were planted in mid-April.  Treatment consisted of (1) full natural light intensity, (2)  47% shade, (3) 73% shade. The shading represented different  3  IVERSITY 0 IDAHO UBRARY  canopy densities. Experimental design was completely random;  each treatment being replicated four times with twenty four seed­lings  per replicate. Shade screen on light wooden framework was  installed the week after planting.  Soil moisture was monitored at weekly intervals by means of  Bouyoucos gypsum blocks. One block was placed at eight and an­other  at sixteen inches depth within two randomly selected plots of  each treatment. Soil thermometers were installed on these same  plots for soil temperature measurements. Relative humidity and air  temperature were monitored in the open by a hygro-thermograph.  Precipitation was measured weekly by a rain gauge. Light inten­sity  was measured on a sunny day each week during the growing  season with a Candella Spectra X-100 meter. Light quality from  380 mu to 750 mu was measured under each treatment with an  Isco Spectroradiometer (model SR) at different times throughout  the day.  Survival and bud break data were collected throughout the  experimental period. Photosynthesis and respiration rates of two  randomly selected seedlings in each plot were determined each week  for the latter two months of the growing season with the same  portable closed atmosphere gas analysis system used in the green­house.  At the end of the growing season, the two seedlings in each  plot which had been involved in photosynthesis and respiration  measurements were removed from the soil and subjected to a  laboratory analysis similar to that described for seedlings in the  greenhouse experiment.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Greenhouse Experiment  Light intensity in the greenhouse averaged only 1600 foot  candles for the no shade treatment even with the supplemental  lighting used. The relatively low light intensity in the greenhouse  as compared to the open sky resulted from white-wash treatment  of the glass for temperature control. Meter reading indicated that  the actual reductions in light intensity provided by the various  shadescreen treatments approximated those to be expected from  the manufacturer's specifications.  Shading did not affect light quality. As light intensity was  decreased the spectra from 380 mu to 750 mu decreased pro­portionally  and uniformly, with no change in dominant wave­lengths.  Red light at 600 mu exhibited the highest energy level  from 0% shade to 927o shade. Robertson (1966) found this rela­tionship  to hold at various north and south latitudes.  Soil moisture and air temperature were maintained at or near  4  optimum, not varying with the degree of shade as could be expected  under field conditions.  Light intensity had significant direct and indirect effects on  grand fir seedling survival and development, computer analysis of  the data revealing many high r 2 values. r2 is defined as the co­efficient  of determination or percent of total variation of one  variable due to a corresponding var iable.  Survival was very good under conditions of full light through  807o shade, ranging between 80% and 1007o . Ninety-two percent  shade however, resulted in only 65% survival. Correlation between  light intensity and sur vival in the greenhouse was low with an r 2  of .38. Lack of a greater effect can probably be related to the  fact that little moisture stress developed in the seedlings, even at  full light intensity under the conditions of soil moisture, tempera­ture  and air movements maintained in the greenhouse.  The percent bud burst under the different shadings was sim­ilar  to percent survival. Bud burst and survival are fairly well  correlated as indicated by an r2 value of .72. This was at least  partly due to criteria pre-established for estimating survival which  required a seedling to break bud and produce new growth during  the first growing season after planting. The effect of light intensity  on bud burst was not great (r2 of .31). Veen and Meijer (1959)  show day length, rather than light intensity, to be the greatest  factor influencing bud burst.  As data concerning photosynthesis and respiration showed  similar trends whether expressed on a per milligram needle tissue  or a per plant basis, only the latter figures are given here (Table  1). After six months of treatment, seventy-five percent of the total  variation in photosynthesis rate was due to light intensity; the  higher the light intensity the greater the photosynthetic rate un­der  shaded conditions. Under f ull light intensity some reduction  Table 1. Photosynthetic and respiration rates of seedlings grown under dif­ferent  degrees of shade in the greenhouse for six months.

The high r 2 value between light intensity and photosynthesis  can be attributed to the favorable environmental conditions of  low internal moisture stress which resulted from a low vapor  pressure deficit in the greenhouse (Hodge and Scott, 1968).  Photosynthesis was very closely related to the dry weight of  new topwood produced (r2 = .92), and dry weight of new needles  produced (r2 = .87). The dry weight of these components steadily  decreased from 30ro shade to the 92ro shade treatments (Table  2). Respiration rate was correlated with photosynthesis (r2 = .82).  With higher daily photosynthetic activity, the greater the daily  and nightly rate of respiration. An indirect relationship of light  intensity to respiration (r2 = .86) was apparent.  Table 2. Production of new tissue (dry weight basis) as determined after  seedlings grew under different shade treatments in the greenhouse  for six months.

This is probably an  indirect correlation, being related to the strong effect of light in­tensity  on photosynthesis. Seedlings grown under higher light  intensities produced more growth, hence had a higher nutritional  demand. New roots were probably produced in order to satisfy  this demand from the relatively infertile potting mixture. The  number of new roots produced was significantly greater for 0 o/o ,  30 o/£&gt;, and 47% shade treatments.  Shade treatments did not significantly influence height growth  except at the 92% shade level. This particular treatment resulted  in significantly reduced shoot elongation.  Field Experiment  Average maximum light intensities were 8,000 foot candles  at 0% shade, with 4,000 f .c. at 47rc shade and 1,900 f.c. at 73%  shade. As found in the greenhouse experiment, the artificial shade  6  did not change the quality of light penetrating the screen, but only  reduced the intensities of the spectral energy proportionally. The  highest level of energy in the open and under the shade screen  again was red light-energy found at a wavelength of 600 mu. The  next highest energy levels were in the blue green at 500 mu and  blue light at 450 mu. The red and blue energy levels are most im­portant  in photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis (Robertson,  1966).  Soil moisture conditions were quite good under all treatments  until the end of July. The percent available moisture became lowest  under the no shade treatment with only 7% available at the eight  inch depth during mid-August. At the sixteen inch depth on these  plots, available soil moisture dropped to 10%. This percentage is  above the 7 0jo lethal limit for grand fir as indicated by Pharis  (1966) for heavier textured soils. By the time the available mois­ture  at the eight inch depth had dropped to 7%, many seedling  roots had extended beyond the eight inch depth, into zones where  there was still available soil moisture. The available soil moisture  under 47% and 730fo shade only dropped to the 10% level at the  eight inch depth during August.  Shading reduced the drying rate of the upper eight inches of  soil by modifying the surface soil temperature. As a result soil  under no shade dried out faster than soil under 47 0jo and 730jo  shade during midsummer. However, by the end of the growing  season, the soil under oo;o shade had a more consistent supply of  available moisture than did the other two treatments. Because of  interception by the screens on shaded plots, more of the September  precipitation infiltrated under 0% shade. In contrast to the situa­tion  earlier the lower soil temperatures prevailing at this time pre­vented  much evaporation from these open plots.  Maximum air temperature and lowest percent relative humid­ity  were reached during July and August, promoting a reduction in  available soil moisture. These same high temperatures and low  relative humidity levels cause higher vapor pressure deficits be­tween  the inside and outside of the needles, creating internal mois­ture  stress (Hodges and Scott, 1968).  Light intensity and survival were negatively correlated, with  an r 2 value of . 7 4. Survival averaged 19 o;o for 0 Ofo shade, 89 o;o  for 47% shade, and 79% for 73% shade. This high negative r2 of  .74 can be best explained by the effect of light intensity on early  spring temperatures and mid-summer available soil moisture as  outlined by Kozlowski (1963). Fairbairn and Neustein (1970)  found the highest survival on one-year-old grand fir seedlings oc­curred  under 50 0jo shade, a result in agreement with the present  experiment. Survival did not vary much between treatments until  internal moisture stress in seedlings began to develop under OOfo  7  shade in early August. This increased stress resulted from a com­bination  of high soil and atmospheric temperatures, and a drop in  the available soil moisture. Over 75 ro of the total mortality for  0% shade occurred during this short mid-summer period. Parker  (1951) found mortality to be very dependent upon high internal  moisture stress. Development of this stress relates more to the rate  of water loss than the actual amount of water lost. Grand fir is  fairly insensitive to this stress, reacting slowly to its amplification  (Boyd, 1969), so large quantities of water are lost from the needle  tissue before stomatal closure begins. Survival was much greater  under 47% and 73% shade because of more favorable conditions  created by the reduced light intensity. Soil temper ature was fair­ly  sensitive to light intensity (r2 value of .53). The reduced soil  temperature under the two levels of shading promoted survival.  Again, as in the greenhouse experiment, correlation between  light intensity and bud burst was not great.  Because of mechanical problems with instrumentation, photo­synthesis  and respiration rates were not measured until high mois­ture  stress had developed. Data concerning photosynthesis and  respiration showed similar trends whether expressed on a per  milligram needle tissue or plant basis; an example of the informa­tion  obtained (plant basis) is shown in Table 3. In comparing the  relationship to light intensity, photosynthesis appears to be re­duced  at the highest light intensities although the value was not  very great. Hodges (1966) found photosynthesis closely corr elated  with internal moisture stress. As the internal moisture stress in­creases,  mesophyll resistance of the needles to gaseous exchange  increases and this causes photosynthesis rates to decrease. Photo­synthetic  rate under 0% shade was only half the rate for seedlings  developed under 47% and 73ro shade. This difference indicates  that there was less moisture stress under the shade treatments  than in the open.  Pharis (1966) found high internal moisture stress promotes  higher respiration rates than photosynthesis rates and subsequent  r eduction in dry weight of tissue. In the present study, respiration  rate is double the photosynthesis rate under oro shade (Table 3),  Table 3. Midsummer photosynthetic and respiration rates of seedlings grown  under different degrets of shade in the field.  Shade  Treatment  0%  47ro  73 ro  ppm C02 Utilized/  Plant/10 minutes  4.00  8.00  7.25  8  ppm C02 Evolved/  Plant/10 Minutes  8.50  5.00  6.25  result in agreement with Pharis (1966). The respiration rate for  the 73 o/o shade treatment is comparable with the rate of oro shade,  both treatments producing greater respiration rates than seedlings  under 47o/o shade. The respiration rate for 0% shade-grown seed­lings  was higher in midsummer than it was for 47% shade-grown  seedlings because of higher internal moisture stress under the open  conditions. Probably the respiration rate of seedlings under 73%  shade was higher than the rate of seedlings under 47 o/o shade be­cause  of higher plant moisture stress resulting from inadequate  new root growth to meet the moisture demands of the former  seedlings.  Dry weight of new topwood was significantly greater in seed­lings  grown in the open and under 47% shade than under 73 o/o  shade (Table 4), although significance was not shown, it appears  that seedlings grown under 47 o/o shade produced more new root  and needle t issue than the other treatments. Light intensity did not  have a high coefficient of determination with either shoot or root  elongation, or number of new roots. However, a definite trend did  develop. Length of new shoot growth, length of new r oots, number  of new roots produced were all greatest under 47o/o shade.  Table 4.

As mentioned ear­lier,  this was mainly due to the fact that the gr eenhouse glass  was whitewashed to help maintain lower atmospheric tempera­tures.  On the other hand, light quality was found to be very simi­lar  in the greenhouse and field experiments. The highest spectral  energy level in the field and gr eenhouse was at 600 mu (red light).  The level of blue light energy in the greenhouse was a little lower  than in the field. This small difference should not affect photosyn­thesis  or chlorophyll synthesis.  Differences in soil moisture relations were probably respon­sible  for the difference in results between greenhouse and field ex­periments.  In the greenhouse, plants were well watered and re-  9  mIV ERSirt. OF. IDAH LIBRARY  gardless of light intensity there was no internal moisture stress  to affect either survival or growth. This is why light intensity had  such a high positive correlation with photosynthesis (r2 = .75) and  respiration (r2 = .86), and a lower positive correlation with sur­vival  (r2 = .38) . In the field, light intensity had a high negative  effect on survival (r2 = .74) and a low negative association with  photosynthesis (r2 = .22), and a low positive association (r2 = .19)  with respiration. The higher the light intensity in the field, the  greater was the effect of (1) soil temperature on reducing avail­able  soil moisture and (2) high air temperatures on lowering rel­ative  humidity and increasing the vapor pressure deficit between  the inside and outside of the needles. Because grand fir stomata  do not react rapidly to internal moisture stresses caused by this  combination of high vapor pressure deficit and low available  soil moisture (Hodges, 1966) large amounts of internal moisture  are lost by transpiration. This rapid loss of moisture is very  conducive to seedling mortality (Boyd, 1969) (Parker, 1951).  The use of shade as an instrument for reduction of seedling  mortality was a very successful practice in the field, but was not  much of a factor in the greenhouse where moisture and tempera­ture  regimes were not affected by light intensity. This gives  further evidence that high light intensity itself does not directly  cause the high mortality found in many field plantings of grand  fir. The effect, rather, is indirect through the influence of high  light intensity on both soil and atmospheric moisture regimes.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  The effects of different light intensities on three-year-old  grand fir seedling survival and development were investigated  in greenhouse and field experiments. During the course of the  work, seedling survival, bud burst, photosynthesis and respiration  rates, and shoot and root growth were measured. A randomized  block experimental design was employed in the greenhouse with  twenty seedlings per block. A completely random design was used  in the field work, each treatment being replicated four times (24  seedlings per replicate). Eight levels of light intensity, ranging  from 0 ro to 92 &lt;J'c shade were involved in the greenhouse phase;  three levels, ranging from 0 7o to 73 &lt;J'o shade were utilized in the  field. Various densities of a commercial material named ""Shade  Screen,"" placed over a wooden framework provided the required  shade.  Soil moisture and soil and air temperatures were kept at favor­able  levels in the greenhouse; in the field these varied with season  and degree of shading. Soil moisture levels under the various treat­ments  as well as other environmental factors were monitored in  the field during the growing season.  10  Greenhouse survival was very high under all treatments except  under 92% shade where survival dropped to 65%. Light intensity  had little effect on greenhouse survival (r2 = .38), because other  environmental conditions of soil moisture, soil and air temperatures  were maintained near optimum. Under these conditions no in­ternal  moisture stresses developed to cause mortality and seedlings  could respond to all of the available light. The low survival under  92% shade was due to low bud burst and poor root growth because  light intensity was very low (only 45 foot candles).  Field survival and growth were negatively related to light  intensity which strongly affected such environmental factors as  soil and air temperatures, available soil moisture and relative  humidity. Bud burst was very high regardless of treatment. Sur­vival  was very low under 0 ro shade ( 19 o/o ), much higher under  73% shade (79%) and highest under 47 &lt;J'o shade (89 o/o ).  The low survival under 0% shade resulted from high internal  moisture stress in the seedlings. This stress was promoted by low  available soil moisture, higher transpiration rates and low relative  humidity. A reduction of light intensity to one half that of full sun­light  (8,000 down to 4,000 foot candles), reduced the effect of these  stress factors and increased survival more than four-fold.  The results of this study indicate good survival can be obtained  on plantings of grand fir seedlings if the planting site is somewhat  shaded. A shelterwood area would be ideal in this regard. Because  survival is promoted by lower internal moisture stress rather than  lower light intensity per se, survival rates could also be obtained  in completely unshaded field planting areas if sprinkler irrigation  systems were available.

A total of  47,500 fish captured in gill and trap nets was lIsed to assess rela­tive  abundance. There were extensive movements of fish between  Round L,ke and contiguous Lake Coeur d'Alene.

Bullhead and slickers were found  in greatest numbers in August.  The fi sh fauna of Round Lake appears to be composed of  seasonally-abundant populations influenced most strongly by the  tempe rature, percent saturation of disso lved oxygen and depth  of water. Most recovered tagged fi sh remained near the point of  tagging throughout the summer. In fall , when the lake level was  falling rapidly, the tagged fish recovered moved into Lake Coeur  d'Alene and other contiguous bodies of water.  .'  Environmental Correlates of Seasonal Abundance  and Movement of Fish in Round Lake, Idaho  By  Pat E. MarclI son1 and Norman It Howse:.!  This paper reports a study of seasonal abundance and movement  of seven species of fish in Round Lake, Idaho, together with environ­mental  conditions under which seasonal changes took place.  Round Lake, in northern Idaho, orig inally was a I50-acre, round  body of water located on the north side of the lower St. Joe Hiver near  Lake Coeur d'Alene. There was no direct water connection between  Hound Lake and Lake Coeur d'Alene before 1906 (Davenport, 1921),  the year when Post Falls Dam was completed at the outlet of Lake Coeur  d'Alene, rais ing the water level. A fin ger or bay formed on the south­ernmost  portion of Lake Coeur d'Aiene inclu.ded the original Round  Lake, and is now known as Hound Lake. It is 3 miles long and one­haif  mile wide, Or about 1,0BO acres during stable summer water levels,  and is seasonall y characterized by fluctuating water levels, high sum­mer  water temperature and a luxuriant growth of aquatic plants occu­pying  approximately 50%. of the water surface. Heavy algal blooms  are also typical during the summer. The lake has a soft silt bottom  and an average water depth of 2 meters, Maximum depth is 6 meters  in the original lake bas in.  The seven species of fish we found most commonly in the lake  were yellow perch Perca fl avescens (Mitchill), brown bullhead Ictalurus  nebulosus (LeSueur), black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus (LeSuem),  Pllffipkulseed Lcpomis gibbosus (Linnaeus), tench Tinea tinea  (Linnaeus), northern squawfi sh Ptychocheilus oregonensis (Rich­ardson)  and large scale sucker Catostomus macrocheilus Girard.  Other species found in lesser quantities were the largemouth bass  Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede), rainbow trout Salmo gairdneri Rich­ardson,  cutthroat trout Salmo clarki Richardson, brook trout Salvelinus  fontinalis (Mitchill), kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum), redside  shiner Richardsonius balteatus (Richardson) and black bullhead Icta­lmus  melas (Rafinesque).  METHODS AND MATERIALS  Six gill net stations (Fig. 1) were established in Round Lake in  several habitat types and depths. Nets used were monofilament nylon.  Each station was sampled each 3 weeks from April 15 to December ·1,  I Montana Fish and Came Deparbnent, Redlodge, Montana.  ~ Fishery Biologist, U. S. Forest Service, Missoula, Montana.  3  l  I  1965. Two trap net stations were also established. The trap nets were  similar to those described by Crowe (1950).  The total nwnber of fish of all species caught in gill nets and trap  ne ts was used to estimate re1ative abu ndance. Both gill nets and trap  ne ts were selective and abundance estimates derived from their use  must be viewed with caution. Carlander (1942), after several years of  intensive gill-net fishing in Lake of the Woods, concluded that mea­sures  of abundance based on giIJ net catches provided valuable in­formation  if enough samples were secured and if it was rea lized that  the data were not measures but estimates of abundance. A total of  5,284 fi sh of all species caught in the trap nets was tagged with a barb  or jaw tag, and most fish were released at the point of capture. About  200 fish transpOl'ted from trap net sets, were released at each gill net  station. Tag recoveries and observations of spawning activity provided  data on movement patterns.  Limnological data were collected every three weeks at each of the  six gi ll net stations. Physical data collected included air and water  temperature, water depth, light penetra tion, assessed using a Secchi  disk, and turbidity assessed using a B and L Spectronic 20 Colorimeter.  Chemical analyses included those for dissolved oxygen, free carbon di­oxide,  pH, total nitrate and nitrogen, total meta- and ortho-phosphate,  and total iron. Procedures of the American Public Hea lth Association  (1955) were used to assess total dissolved solids.

Plankton invertebrates were collected  with a ten-liter Juday plankton trap fitted with No. 20 silk bolting  cloth in the straining cone and bucket. Organisms were preserved in  95% ethyl alcohol and later measured by total volume, wet weight, and  numbers of each taxonomic group. Qualitative sampling of the benthos  was exeCll ted with a 231 cm' (6-by-6 inch) Ekman dredge. One sample  per station was taken and separated from bottom soils by sieving  through a No. 30 Tyler screen. Organisms were measured by total  volume, wet weight, and numbers of each taxonomic grollp. An IBM  1620 computer program was used for partial data analysis.  A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to measure pos­sible  correlations between abundance of the seven most common fish  species taken in the gill nets and certain environmental fa ctors. The  latter included temperature, depth, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, depth  of light penetrat.ion, benthic invertebrates per sq. meter and number  of zooplankters per liter.  RESULTS  Limnological data. The mean water temperature in Hound Lake  increased from 6.50 C in April to 22.50 C in AUgllst, then decreased to  1.50 C in December (Fig. 2). By February 3, 1966 tlle lake had about  15 cm of ice on the surface.  In the spring of 1965, the St. Joe Hiver overflowed its banks and  the water level, measured with a staff gauge attached to a railroad  trestle at the nortl,ern end of Hound Lake, rose to 3.6 meters. The  water level decreased after the peak flow, and during the summer  months was stable at 2.6 meters. Fall drawdown began in mid-Novem­ber  and became maximal in early March 1966. During tl,ese winter  montllS tl,e lake had less than 0.5 meters of water at the staff gauge  (Fig. 2).  The mean depth of light penetration increased during spring and  early summer months and then sharply declined to less than 0.5 meters  during mid summer due to a bloom of Anabaena. As the water temper­atures  decreased in fall, light penetration again increased and the  bottom became visihle over most of the lake.  The range of turbidity values in Hound Lakes was 0-65 ppm SiO •.  Analysis of water cbemistry data (Table 1) indicated that bicarbonate  alkalinity remained stable during spring, summer and fall and car­bonate  alkalinity occurred only during summer. Seasonal calcium hard­ness  values progressively increased with an over-all mean of 16 ppm.  Maximum concentrations of dissolved solids occurred during summer  in the original lake basin, attaining a level of 79 ppm which was pri­marily  due to organic material (58 ppm).

Iron was present  throughout the sampling period with a mean concentration of .31 ppm.  Free carbon dioxide varied from slimmer lows of zero to a maximum  of 17.0 pprn in spring. Hydrogen-ion concentration was inversely pro­portional  to carbon dioxide levels, being within the range of 7.0 to 9.5.  Concentrations of dissolved oxygen covered a spectrum of values from  0.1 to 15.6 ppm, both highs and lows developing in the original lake  basin area. During summer the mean concentration of dissolved oxygen  in the lake was about 7.0 ppm.  The popuJations of be nthic organisms increased through th e spring  with a peak abundance in August of approximately 65OO/M'. The  abundance decreased steadily through the fall and winter. Predominant  orders were Diptera, Olegochaeta, Bryozoa, Ephemeroptera and Pul­monata.  In 369 plankton samples, we found large quantities of invertebra tes.  Liter samples were 62% protozoans, 21% dadocerans, 11% copepods,  5%. rotiIers and 1% ostracoda during midsummer. Plankton were nearly  absent during April and early May. Population density increased in late  May, peaked in August with a mean of 232 organisms per liter, then  declined rapidly in the fall.  Relative abundance. The 47,500 fish caught in gill nets and trap  nets were lIsed to assess relative abundance of the 7 most common  species (Fig. 3). The species catch per effort in all the gill nets was  7  •. ..

The species percentage in the individual trap  ne ts was also computed and then averaged. The pe rcent re lative abun­dance  in both gill and trap ne ts was then combined to give an estimate  of the ave ra]) relative abundance. It is assumed that the nwnber of  each species of fish captured, relative to the amount of fishing effort  expended, was a reasonable index of species abundance. The bullhead  was the most nume rous fish and when combined with the perch repre­sented  74% of the to tal gill and trap net catch. Tench and squawfish  respectively appeared next most abundant, fo llowed in order by the  crappie, sucker and pumpkinseed.  Seasonal abundance. The maximum abundance of perch was in  May (Table 2) while the crappie were most abundant in June. In July  the tench, pumpkinseed and squaw fish were the most numerous. Bull­head  and suckers were found in greatest numbers in August.  Movement. vVith the except.ion of perch and squawfish, most re­covered  tagged fish tended to remain near the poin t of tagging through­out  the summer months. McCammon and Seeley (1961) noted that  bullheads tagged in an arm of a large lake tended to remain in that arm.  Ball (1944) also noted that bullheads remained i ~ a limited area after  tagging.  Perch showed no general movement patterns and appeared to range  freely within the lake. Squawfi sh apparently moved down-lake through­out  the sampling period. In the fall, when the water leve l was falling,  the tagged fi sh recovered had moved down-lake into Lake Coeur  d'Alene, and apparently dispersed widely. Two bull heads traveled  more than 20 miles northward in the Lake Coeur d'Alene complex.  Other bullhead, crappie, and percb had traveled lesser distances but  were recovered in several different contiguous bodies of water.  Environmental correlates.

The relationship between abundance of perch and percent  saturation of dissolved oxygen was nonSignificant. There was a nega­tive  correlation between abundance of both bullhead and crappie and  the depth of light penetration. Crappie were most numerous in June,  when light penetration was reduced due to turbidity from spring runoff.  Bullhead were most abundant in Ju ly and August, when the bloom of  Anabaena was maximal, reducing light penetration. The bullhead, be­ing  primarily a bottom feeder, also showed a significant positive corre­lation  with numbers of benthic organisms. Plankton numbers were sig­nificantly  correlated with the numbers of squawfish taken in the gill  nets. Stomach samples taken from the squawfish contained many  plankters during the summer when planktonic invertebrates were most  numerous.  Table 3.

DISCUSSION  Prior to the initiation of this study, there had been little intensive  work done on Hound Lake or any of the waters contiguous to the lake.  Kemmerer et ""I. (1923) and Ellis (1932) both conducted general limno­logical  studies in the Lake Coeur d'Alene area, but neither study was  specifically directed at Round Lake.  ..

Round Lake may be classified  (Welch, 1952) as eutrophic. It provides an ideal warm·water spawning  and rearing area for several fish species found in Lake Coeur d'Alene.  It appears that the various fish populations move into Round Lake in  the spring and early SLUnffie r months as water temperature increases.  There were si~nifica nt correlations between abundance of all species  (except suckers) and water temperature.  Percent saturation of dissolved oxygen was maximal during July  and August and the re were significant correlations of oxygen cancew  tration with abundance of all species except the sucker and perch. The  numbers of pe rch caught in nets decreased during August, then in­creased  in the late fall, largely due to recruitment of young·of-the-year.  Depth of water, while not significantly corre lated with net catches  due to lack of netting durin g winter, seemed to strongly influence  abundance and movement of fi sh. In late faJl and winter, lake draw­clown  was rapid and the livable space in Hound Lake was markedly  reduced. When the water level in the fall began recedi.ng, tag recover­ies  of the seve ral fish species indicated a general movement out of the  lake. Moody (1957) conducted studies on a shallow lake with connecting  river system in Florida and found that a gradual decline in total fish  populations appeawd to be directly related to a steady recession of  water level in the lake. Greenbank (1956) noted that a lowerin g of the  water level in the ~'liss i ss ippi River, with a resultant current flowing  out of the back-waters, produced a movement of carp, northern pike,  crappie, bowfin, and several other species. The movement was from  the backwater toward the main river channe l, i.e., with th e current,  and was intensified by a rapid drawdown. Greenbank noted that the  fi sh appeared to be moving actively rather than being swept along by  th e current.  Tag recoveries outside of Hound Lake have indicated that there is a  wide dispersal once the fi sh reach Lake Coeur d'Alene. Many tags were  recovered several miles from Round Lake.  We believe the Hound Lake fi sh fauna is composed of seasonally  abundant populations influenced strongly by environmental factors.  Interactions between environmental factors (Table 3) showed positive  correlations for temperature and dissolved oxygen and temperature and  plankton. Negative correlations appeared for light and temperature,  light and turbidity and light and plankton. As the temperature increased  the percent saturation of dissolved oxygen and plankton increased.  The latter reduced light penetration. Increased turbidity from spring  freshets also reduced light penetration. The degree of interaction  by these environmental factors is not completely understood by  fi shery workers, but the abundance and movement of the various fish  populations in Hound Lake can be correlated to water temperature,  dissolved oxygen and depth. Casual relationships remain to be proven.  11  UNIVERSITY Of fDAIIO UBRAR  LITERATURE CITED  Amer. Pub. Health Assoc. 1955.

Adams and E. W. Mogren  Station Peper No. 18  November, 1974  STOCKING PARAMETERS FOR LODGEPOLE PINP  David L. Adams and E. W. Mogren1  The expression of stocking levels in forest stands has been the  subject of many r esearch efforts and much discussion over the past  decades. Quantification of stocking levels has been the goal of much  of this effort. This paper suggests a growth-per-tree approach to  the quantification of stocking levels. The technique is illustrated  through the development of preliminary stocking levels for natural  stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus cont01·ta Doug!.) in Colorado and  southern Wyoming. The levels of stocking sought are those of mini­mum  and maximum occupancy of the site. Minimum occupancy is  defined as the level of stocking at which the density is such that the  trees present have the potential of just occupying the site but with  an absence of crown competition. Maximum occupancy is inter­preted  to mean the density level wher e the annual growth per acre,  calculated on the basis of individual tree growth, culminates.  Determination of Maximum Occupancy  The growth variable employed to measure individual tree per­formance  in relation to stocking is annual basal area growth in  square feet. Cubic volume was considered as a measure of growth  but was discarded in favor of basal area. Since cubic volume is so  closely correlated with basal area (Hawley and Smith, 1954; Spurr,  1952), there appeared to be little advantage in using the more com­plex  and indirect measure.  Crown Competition Factor (Krajicek and Brinkman, 1957)  was chosen as the measure of stand density because regression  analyses indicated a closer correlation between annual basal area  growth and C.C.F . than with either basal area or number of stems  per acre. A thirty-year period was selected as the time interval for  growth analysis. A shorter period failed to satisfactorily show  growth events in slow-growing natural stands of lodgepole pine.  For analyses, tree diameters as they existed thirty years ago, de­termined  from increment cores, were labeled initial diameters and  current diameters, measured with a diameter tape, were termed  present diameters. Diameter classes one through six inches based  on initial diameters were included in the study. Approximately  five thousand trees from fifty-three plot locations in Colorado and  southern Wyoming were included in the final computations.  • Published with the approval of the Director, Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station,  Univel'sity of Idaho, Moscow.

TO CIRCUL~TE SEE  LIBRARIAN THIS FLOOR  The step by step procedure used to establish the maximum oc­cupancy  values is as follows:  Step 1.-The annual basal area growth rate per tree as a  function of stand density was the fundamental relationship upon  which the procedure was built. Before the correlation between  growth rate and density was computed, it was first necessary to  determine if annual basal area growth per tree in natural lodgepole  pine stands was significantly related to site quality.  The plots were classified by decadal Site Index classes from  thirty to ninety. An analysis of variance was then used to test the  hypothesis that there was no difference in basal area growth per  tree due to site quality. The F value did not indicate that the hypo­thesis  should be rejected at the five percent significance level; there­fore  the plot data were treated independently of Site Index.  Step 2.-A regression of annual basal area growth per tree  (BAG/ T), independent of diameter, on initial Crown Competition  Factor (CCFI) was computed using values from all 53 plot loca­tions.  The resulting linear equation, (1/ BAG/ T) = - 649 +  7.6016 (CCFI), was used to obtain an estimated basal area growth  per tree (BAG/ T) value. The regression had a correlation coeffi­cient  (r) of . 78, and the slope of the line was statistically significant  at the one percent level.  Step 8.-The data from the 53 plot locations were next grouped  by one-inch diameter classes based upon mean initial tree diam­eter.  A linear equation was then calculated for each diameter class  showing the relationship between initial Crown Competition Fac­tor  and estimated basal area growth per tree. The regression equa­tions  are presented in Table 1.  TABLE 1. Linear equations by diameter classes, showing the re­lationship  between annual basal area growth per tree and initial  crown competition factor.

Next the basal area per acre represented in each CCF level  was obtained by solving the CCF equation for basal area. The CCF  equation for lodgepole pine is: CCF = 50.58 + (5.25BA/ DBH);  where BA is basal area per acre, and DBH is average stand diam­eter  (Alexander, 1966). Inserting the average diameter for the  class and the CCF level, the only unknown remaining was basal  area per acre which appears in column three.  The number of trees per acre (column 4) corresponding to  each basal area level was obtained by dividing the basal area per  acre by the cross-sectional area of the tree of average diameter.  Annual basal area growth per acre (column 5) was then com­puted  for each CCF level by multiplying the estimated basal area  growth per tree (column 2) by the computed number of trees per  acre (column 4).  Plotting the basal area growth per acre values (column 5) over  density (column 1) yielded a curve which revealed the culmination  of basal area growth for the diameter class. As can be seen in  Table 2 the basal area growth per acre for the one-inch diameter  class culminated at a CCF level of 265.  The procedure as shown in Table 2 was followed for each diam­eter  class. The resulting values at the peak of basal area growth  for each class are presented in Table 3.  4  TABLE 3.

The slope of the equation, 1/BA/ A = .00389 + .0000488  (CCF) with a correlation coefficient of .78, was significant at the  one percent level.  Step 6.-ln order to identify particular points on the maxi­mum  occupancy curve; i.e., levels representing particular diameter  values, a weighted regression of peak basal area per acre over  average class diameter was computed. The values in Table 3 were  used to compute this regression.  The regression equation resulting from the above values was:  BA/ A = 45.4 + 9.9857 (DBH) ; with an r value of .87. The F  test indicated statistical significance at the one percent level.  Step 7.-The basal area per acre values for diameters 1.0  through 8.0 inches were computed using the equation developed in  Step 6. These values appear in column 4, Table 4. The basal area  per acre value for each diameter was then divided by the cross­sectional  area of a tree of the corresponding size to obtain the  number of trees per acre represented by each basal area level,  column 5, Table 4.  Determination of Minimum Occupancy  The minimum occupancy level is based on the capability of  lodgepole pine trees to occupy space in the absence of crown com­petition.  Open-grown trees were measured and a regression of  crown width to D.B.H. was calculated (C.W. = 3.94 + 1.44 DBH,  r = .951; Alexander, 1967). From these data, crown areas by  D.B.H. classes were calculated and number of trees and · basal area  per acre determined by each D.B.H. class. These data combined  with maximum density values appear in Table 4.  TABLE 4. Minimum and maximum occupancy values for natural  stands of lodgepole pine in Colorado and southern Wyoming.

Belt, Jack King, and Everett Bally  University of Idaho  ABSTRACT  A fast response meteorological instrument system for measuring parameters used in  calculating evapotranspiration above a forest stand is described. Comprised of Gill-type  propeller anemometers, Brady-array humidity sensors, thermistor air-temperature sen­sors  and a Metro-Data digital tape recorder, the system was designed to measure eddy  fluctuations in the range from one to 0.005 cycles per second. Details of the shop-built  signal conditioning circuitry for the Brady-array are presented along with a discussion of  apparatus and techniques employed to calibrate the sensors as a part of the instrument  system. Problems with electrical noise and condensation within instrument packages  which occurred during field trials are also discussed.  INTRODUCTION  Measurement of evapotranspiration above a forest stand by the eddy correlation  method requires an instrument system capable of responding to, and measuring rapid  changes in, vertical wind velocity, W, and specific humidity, 0 . These fluctuations,  caused by the eddying motion of the air moving past the measurement point, have a  nominal frequency range or spectrum of 0.005 to approximately 10 cycles per second,  cps. The response of the system ideally must be sufficient to measure the full range of  time-dependent fluctuations of the aforementioned quantities. In practice, when using  less than perfect instruments, it is sufficient to measure that portion of the frequency  spectrum where most of the fluctuations occur and to estimate error caused by the  system's inability to accurately measure the higher frequency fluctuation . While infor­mation  defining the range of frequencies to be expected above a forest stand is sparse,  work by McBean (1968) suggests that the greater portion of the range lies between  frequencies of 0.005 and 1.0 cps. This is in general agreement with studies made above  other types of vegetative cover and was taken as a working assumption in the design of  this system. For more detailed consideration of design requirements, refer to McBean  (1972).  In measuring evapotranspiration, with eddy correlation methodology, the more dif­ficult  measurement is the specific humidit}: fluctuations 0 ', where 0 '=0 - Q and 0 is the  instantaneous value of specific humidity, 0 is the average value of 0 over some specified  period and 0 ' is the instantaneous deviation from the mean. Some earlier approaches to  this problem have been the use of (1) the fine-wire wet-bulb in the evapotron by Dyer  (1965), (2) the barium-florida sensor by Goltz et al. (1970) and (3) the Lyman-alpha  humidiometer by Miyake et al. (1970). These sensors were rejected due to their difficulty  of maintenance, difficulty of manufacture or cost, respectively. A new sensing element,  the Brady-array, was chosen instead, principally because of its solid-state nature, 300  millisecond response, moderate cost, and the comparative ease with which it could be  maintained in inaccessible locations. The Brady-array, described in more detail in a  subsequent section, is manufactured by Thunder Scientific of Albuquerque, New Mex­ico.  2  . .

The following portion of this report provides a brief  description of the wind instrument with more detailed explanation of electronic circuitry  and calibration methods devised to utilize the Thunder Scientific sensor as a component  in the instrument system.  Propeller Anemometers  Due to their comparative low cost and simplicity of operation, Gill-type propeller  anemometers were selected over faster response hot-wire anemometers for vertical  velocity measurement. Both commercial propeller anemometers (R. M. Young Co.) and  shop-built propeller anemometers were utilized. The latter anemometers, constructed  from a design supplied by L. J . Fritschen (1972, personal communication), have  performance characteristics similar to those commercially available. Four-bladed, 23  em (9-inch) diameter propellers supplied by the R. M. Young Co. were used on both  commercial and shop-built units. These sensors, with distance constants of approxi­mately  one meter, provided nominal response time of approximately one second. Cali­bration  of the anemometers was accomplished by driving the propeller shafts at known  revolutions per minute, rpm, and by measuring the millivolt, mV, output of the sensor  tachometers with the digital recording system.  Relative Humidity and Temperature Sensor  The Brady-array  The Brady-array consists of an array of crystals which form semi-conducting bodies.  As water vapor penetrates the interstitial spaces of the crystal lattice, bonds are dis­torted,  causing energy to be released to the free electrons in the structure. The element  then conducts more readily, decreasing in resistance as more electrons enter the  structure. The Brady-array is normally operated as one element of a voltage divider,  across which is applied as AC excitation of approximately 5 volts root mean square, rms,  at a frequency of one kilohertz, kHz. The voltage output of the circuit follows changes in  relative humidity and in our circuit varies from approximately 0.10 volts rms at zero  percent relative humidity up to approximately five volts rms at 100 percent relative  humidity.  3  IBIIVIRSIIY II JDAIID ...

The diagram  includes circuits for both temperature and humidity sensors and is partitioned into three  sections labeled sensor, remote, and master. Each section relates to a different physical  location for the associated components.  The physical arrangement of the sensor and remote packages as used in the field is  shown in Figure 1. White polyvinylchloride, PVC, tubing of 5.0 em (2-inch) inner diameter  provides a weather tight housing for the electronic circuitry housed in the remote  package. Electronic components are mounted on a printed circuit, PC, card for ease of  assembly. Placement of the remote circuitry in white PVC tubing reduces thermal stress  due to solar radiation on the electrical components. This protection, coupled with the  low offset voltage drift inherent in the operational amplifiers chosen, minimizes errors  due to temperature variations. Further reduction of temperature related errors is ac­complished  by use of the full range of output voltage of the operational amplifiers which  are employed in low gain circuit configurations.  A short length of cable routed through a section of 1.90 em (nominal :Y4 inch)  galvanized pipe connects sensor and remote units. The pipe also serves as a duct to  route air from the sensor shield inlet to an exhaust fan. Physical separation of the remote  and sensor units permits the construction of a compact sensor radiation shield. This  minimizes disturbance of air flow near the anemometers. Electronic "" loading"" of the  Brady-array voltage divider circuit by the eight-foot connecting cable is avoided by  including a voltage-follower amplifier (LM 302) in the sensor package.  The master unit electronics are housed within a chassis several hundred feet from  the remote and sensor packages. In this unit, temperature and relative humidity signals  are fed to a central terminal strip and to voltage level adjustment networks to which  recording equipment can be easily attached. To facilitate field checking and the sub­stitution  of system components, the entire electronics assembly was constructed in  modular form with generous use of electrical connectors.  Relative humidity circuit  A block diagram of the relative humidity circuitry is shown in Figure 2. An oscillator  provides a constant AC excitation to the Brady-array sensor network. Output from the  sensor is fed to a voltage follower circuit and from there to a demodulator unit. The  demodulator produces a DC, output signal proportional to relative humidity, which is  adjusted by a voltage divider circuit and then recorded.  The circuit diagram of the excitation oscillator is shown in Figure 3a. It is a Wein  bridge oscillator employing an operational amplifier as the active element. A zener  diode-resistor network is used in the negative feedback path of the operational amplifier  to stabilize the oscillation amplitude. When the voltage across the diode pair exceeds  the zenor breakdown voltage, the diodes conduct to connect resistor R5 in parallel with  resistor R4. This increases negative feedback in the circuit to limit the amplitude. The  1,000 ohm potentionmeter, P1 , also affects the negative feedback and provides limited  adjustment of the output amplitude. The oscillation frequency is determined by resis­tors,  R1 and R2, and capacitors, C1 and C2. Transformer, T1 , precludes any possibility of  a DC voltage component at the output as required by the Brady-array elements.  The Brady-array sensor network to which the oscillator output is connected is shown  in Figure 3b. The Brady-array constitutes one element of a voltage divider circuit. The  other element of the circuit is a glass enclosed Brady-array sensor which is contained in  the sensor package purchased from Thunder Scientific. The resistance of the glass  enclosed sensor varies only with temperature and serves to compensate the circuit for  temperature variations. Loading of the divider circuit is minimized by the voltage fol­lower,  A 1, which has an input impedance in excess of 1 o• ohms. This unit also isolates  the sensor circuit from any capacitance effects of the cable which connects it to the  demodulator unit.  The demodulator circuit is shown in Figure 3c. It is a precision rectifier-filter circuit  which produces a DC voltage output that is proportional to the amplitude of the AC  voltage from the sensor. Capacitor, C4, is selected for the desired filtering action. A value  of 0.82 microfarads is a compromise value which gives relatively fast response to  4  01  F igure 1  Sensor mounting Arm showing installation  of sensor and remote instrument package.

RECORDER  changes in the amplitude of the sensor signal (16.2 millisecond circuit time constant)  and still maintains a minimum of ripple in the DC output. Capacitor, C3, serves two  purposes in coupling the sensor unit to the demodulator. It passes the AC sensor  humidity signal to the demodulator and blocks any DC offset or drift voltage from the  voltage follower amplifier. Capacitor, C5, suppresses high frequency oscillation which  otherwise can occur at the demodulator output when it is connected to the 300-foot  cable which links the demodulator to the gain adjust network.  The voltage divider network which is used for gain adjustment of the relative humid­ity  signal is shown in Figure 3d. Resistors R18, R19, R20, and R21 provide the adjustment  feature. Use of the parallel combination of R19 and R20 rather than a single resistance  facilitates the hand selection of 5 percent tolerance resistors to achieve 1 percent  tolerance gain adjustment. The network provides output ranges of zero to +1 volt and  zero to + 10 millivolts. Capacitors, CS and C9, attenuate noise which appears on the  300-foot connecting cable.  Temperature circuit  A block diagram of the temperature sensing network is shown in Figure 4a. The  temperature sensing element is a thermistor which is contained in the sensor package  purchased from Thunder Scientific. This element is used in conjunction with a voltage  divider and a voltage follower unit to produce a voltage signal which follows changes in  temperature. An output amplifier adjusts the voltage signal for recording purposes.  Thermistor and voltage networks are shown in Figure 4b. The thermistor and the  fixed resistor, R16, constitute a voltage divider network which generates the tempera­ture  signal. A negative 10 volt bias for this circuit is produced by a second voltage divider  composed of resistors, R15 and A17. The voltage follower amplifier, AS, receives the  temperature signal and its high input impedance minimizes loading of the thermistor  circuit. Resistance of the thermistor varies from approximately 6 Megohms at 0 C to 470  Kilohms at 40 C to produce - 3.2 volts to - 7.8 volts, respectively, at the voltage follower  output. Capacitors, C6 and C7, are necessary to shunt out 1 Kilohertz AC voltages which  are unavoidably coupled into the circuit from the relative humidity network.  Shown in Figure 4c is the circuit diagram of the output amplifier. This amplifier  serves two important functions. First, it adjusts the reference level of the temperature  signal to center it at 0 volts. Under these conditions the temperature signal can produce  both a positive and a negative voltage swing. The second function is that of amplification  of the temperature signal to expand it over the entire positive and negative output ranges  of the amplifier. This produces maximum resolution of the temperature signal and  reduces errors which can result from offset or drift voltages in the operational amplifier  units. For the temperature range of 0 C to 40 C an amplification factor of 4.2 is appro­priate.  Both the amplification and reference level adjust features can be easily changed  to accommodate any temperature range of concern. The amplification factor is control­led  by the resistors in the operational amplifier circuit and is given by  Ka = (1 + R2J R22) [R2si (R24 + A2s)J.  The DC voltage added to the temperature signal for reference level adjustment is  equal to the breakdown voltage of zener diode, D5, multiplied by a gain factor whose  expression is  K, = (1 + ~i~2) [~4/(R24 + ~)] .  This assumes that the zener diode, D5, is carrying enough current to operate in its  breakdown region . Appropriate selection of the resistor, A28, establishes this mode of  operation.  At the output of the amplifier a voltage divider network is used to establish precise  signal voltage ranges for recording purposes. The divider consists of resistors R25, R27,  and A29. These provide ranges of ±1 volt and ±10 millivolts. Capacitors C10, C11, and  C12 have been added to the circuit for noise suppression. Compromise values have been  used for these elements such that noise is greatly reduced while the response time of the  network is not degraded beyond the time constant of the thermistor.  Power Supply  A dual output 15 volt DC power supply (A. 0. Associates, Model115) is used to power  7  FIGURE 3. COMPONENTS OF THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY SYSTEM  R1 C1  Figure 3a.

The power supply is housed in the master electronics package.  Voltage is carried to the remote and sensor packages over the 96 meter and 3 meter  connecting cables. The common terminal of the supply is connected to the 95 meter  cable ground wire as shown in the Appendix and capacitors C15 and C16 are added from  the + 15 volt and - 15 volt leads to ground in the remote package. These capacitors  reduce the impedance from the voltage leads to ground to compensate for the resis­tance  added to the power supply by the long lead lengths. Finally, resistance R34 is  connected from the + 15 volt lead to ground at the remote to balance the currents in the  negative and positive wires. This reduces the ground wire current to zero to prevent the  occurrence of a voltage drop in that wire.  CALIBRATION  The Brady-array sensors are calibrated by Thunder Scientific using a precision  excitation source and synchronized demodulator. Since a new circuit design and com­ponent  lay-out were developed for the sensors and because the output voltage of the  sensors was to be scaled to the range of zero to ten millivolts, each sensor was  recalibrated as a part of the total system before field use.  Saturated Salts  An initial attempt to calibrate the sensors was made using saturated salt solutions in  equilibrium at standard temperatures. Several salt solutions were used to obtain refer­ence  points for a calibration curve plotting R.H. against voltage output. With this  technique repeatable results were unobtainable. Apparently deposition of salts within  the crystal lattice of the Brady-array changed the characteristic resistance of the sensor.  After consulting with Thunder Scientific and noting their use of a split-flow calibration  system monitored by a precision psychrometer, the use of a salt solution was aban­doned.  Humidity Chamber  To obtain known relative humidity and temperature values, a method was developed  wherein stable calibration points could be maintained through regulation of tempera­ture  and water vapor concentrations in a small, 865 cc, cylindrical chamber. Figure 5  shows the basic design of the apparatus.  The humidity chamber was made of stainless steel which permitted rapid tempera­ture  response within the chamber when a change in the water bath temperature was  made. Brass fittings in the chamber wall permitted simultaneous calibration of four  sensors.  Humidity conditions in the chamber were usually manipulated by varying the  chamber air temperature; however, extreme values were regulated by passing the  circulating air either through a column of desiccant to achieve humidities less than 15  percent, or through a saturated chamber to achieve humidities above 85 percent. The  water bath allowed regulation of the temperature in the control chamber from room  temperature up to 6o•c . An auxiliary pump attached to the water bath transferred to cold  water (0-2•c) from a separate source and mixed it with existing water to achieve temper­atures  below room temperature. When working in temperature ranges not near room  temperature, there was an inherent 1•c difference between the chamber air temperature  and the water bath temperature. This was caused by temperature changes in the air as it  passed through the dewpoint hygrometer and other apparatus. Water loss was  minimized by use of brass fittings and tubing of low absorptivity. By regulating tempera­ture  and water vapor concentrations, we were able to provide a range of humidities of  approximately 6 to 95 percent. A Cambridge Systems dewpoint hygrometer, model  922-C1 with platinum resistance thermometer, continuously sampled chamber air and  provided a millivolt signal linearly proportional to the dewpoint temperature. This signal  was recorded on a strip-chart. Air temperature in the chamber was monitored using a  500 ohm platinum resistance thermometer connected to a manual precision resistance  bridge. With this system we were able to measure R.H. to better than plus or minus two  percent, and air temperature to ±0.15•c.  10  DEWPOINT  HYGROMETER  Figure 5  DESICCANT  WATER VAPOR  r.:=== SENSOR  Apparatus used to calibrate RH and temperature sensors  11  Thunder Scientific reports a hysteresis in the Brady-array of one to two percent R.H.  and a typical accuracy of plus or minus two percent. Using this calibration system, errors  of four to six percent R.H. were observed of which part appeared to be hysteresis.  Additional error may have been due to a lack of complete mixing in the T0-5 can  enclosing the Brady-array. A flow of 472cc per second maintained in the chamber may  not have completely purged the interstitial spaces of the crystalline Brady-array even  though several minutes were provided to obtain equilibrium. To minimize this problem  calibration runs were initiated by raising chamber air temperature to approximately 4a•c  and permitting air to flow through the desiccant column. This resulted in R.H. values of  six to eight percent. Subsequently, chamber temperature was reduced and/or absolute  vapor content of the chamber was increased so that R.H. increased to about 95 percent.  At this point the procedure was reversed so that R.H. went from 95 to 6 percent. A typical  curve, B, and data points obtained by this procedure are shown in FigureS. Curve A is the  calibration curve supplied by the manufacturer. Similarity of curve shapes is evident for  this sensor, however all sensors did not produce this degree of similarity. The difference  in voltage range of the two curves, as well as shape similarities (or differences) is a  function of both the sensor and the electronics used in the measuring circuits. Sensors  tested by the above procedures were connected to the recording system and electronic  circuitry in the same manner that they were to be used in the field to minimize errors.  Temperature sensor calibration curves were typically linear over range from 3•c to  4o•c providing a - 10 to + 10 m.v. output for this range.  FIELD TRIALS  The Cedar River watershed, an intensive study site, under the IBP Coniferous Biome  program, is situated in the Douglas-fir, western hemlock forest near Issaquah, Washing­ton  . In August 1972, the instrument system was placed at this location to estimate  evapotranspiration. The master unit was housed in a small trailer along with support  equipment. Cables averaging 91 meters in length were run to each of three  communications-type towers from the trailer. Remote and sensor packages were lo­cated  on each of the three towers at heights of 30 meters.  Initial use of the system uncovered two problems: (1) high frequency noise, i.e.,  greater than 10 cps, in the connecting cables which resulted in unwanted noise in the  recorded digital signal and (2) condensation which occurred in the PVC remote contain­ers  causing failure or frequent erroneous readings. The first of these problems had been  anticipated because of the use of unshielded cable and was largely eliminated by the use  of 150 microfarad capacitors between the positive side of the signal input to the recorder  and common ground. This solution was suggested by the Metro-Data Corporation and  did not significantly change the system's performance. The second p· oblem , not suffi­ciently  appreciated in advance and not completely resolved, was the result of frequent  rainfall, high humidity and temperature fluctuations sufficient to cause daily condensa­tion  on electronic components in the remote housing. These difficulties were temporar­ily  overcome by periodic drying of components, additional use of potting compounds on  connectors and insertion of larger amounts of desiccant in the PVC housings. The  problem of condensation severely hampered our field effort and reduced the amount of  usable data.  Data obtained during initial field trials were insufficient to fully evaluate the system or  to draw conclusions regarding the meteorological processes under study. Reduction in  support monies by NSF and priorities established in the Coniferous Biome Program  resulted in loss of financial support to conclude the field portion of this project. This loss  of support did not constitute dissatisfaction with the work described herein or that  proposed, but rather the ebb and flow of grant funding .

Schuster  E. Bruce Godfrey  and William D. Koss 2  \.Jhat will be the impact on people number of jobs and wages -- if  a decision·is made to change the level of timber harvest in a particular  a r ea of Idaho? The answer to this question would seem to be of more  than passing interest to land-use planners and decision-makers concerned  with natural resource management. Indeed, a ssessment of these likely  impacts does not appear discretionary, at least for Federal officials.  A wide range of administrative and statutory law makes social and economic  impact assessments mandatory. However, a generally inadequate information  base has precluded meaningful assessments of probable employment and wage  impacts resulting from changes in timber harvest levels. This paper is  designed to augment the existing information base to better facilitate these  needed evaluations.  1  The research reported here is part of the Idaho Forest Industry Study  (Project 44-308) jointly sponsored by the Intermountain Forest and Range  Experiment Station, U.S. Forest Service and the Forest, Wildlife and  Range Experiment Station, University of Idaho .  2  Authors are assistant professor, associate professor and graduate assistant,  respectively, College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, University  of Idaho.  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO tiBQ  L  - 2 -  Probable impacts on employment and wages can be viewed in two major  ways. First, impacts of a proposed change in the level of timber to be  harvested can be analyzed in a total or aggregate context. Aggregate  impacts on employment and wages include direct as well as indirect impacts.  Direct impacts would concern primary consumers of timber harvest -- the  timber-using industry. Indirect impacts are sometimes called secondary,  spill-over or rippling effects; these involve employment and wage impacts  on industries that support, or are supported by, the timber-using industry.  The analytical techniques of input-output analysis and economic base  multipliers are useful to measure aggregate impacts. The second way of  viewing impacts is more restrictive, dealing only with di rect impacts.  This paper adopts the latter point of view. The methodology developed is  applicable to employment and wage impacts in Idaho's timber-using industry  that are likely to result from a change in the level of timber harvest  in Idaho. The term ""timber-using industry"" refers to firms classified in  the Standard Industrial Code as SIC 24: Lumber and Wood Products, Except  Furniture, and SIC 26: Paper and Allied Products.  3  Tables 1 and 2 show a series of multipliers relating Idaho's timber  harvest to employment and wages in Idaho's timber-using industry. Boundaries  of the six official state planning regions referenced in these tables are  shown in Figure 1. Timber harvested outside Idaho but used by Idaho's  industry is included as a seventh region of timber origin -- imports . The  import region includes timber cut in Washington, Montana, Oregon and Wyoming.  3  Additionally, characteristics of the subclass, SIC 2433, were deleted from  the overall SIC 24 class; this subclass deals with the manufactur~ of  prefabricated homes which does not receive harvested timber .  •  ·•  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  -----reCoA:N:=A-O--A- ,.-- ,___ . .

Each multiplier4 in the tables can be interpreted as  a conversion factor -- a factor converting timber cut (in specific origin  region) into employment and wage levels in regions receiving harvested  timber. Multipliers indicated the estimated number of peopl' e employed or  thousand dollars of wages paid per million board feet of timber cut. For  example, the multiplier, .29 shown in Table 1 for timber cut in Region II  and delivered to Region III should be interpreted as follows: each  million board feet of timber cut in Region II is associated with .29  people employed in timber-using industries of Region III. Alternatively,  when read completely across a horizontal row for a specified region by  origin of cut multipliers show the overall pattern of employment or wage  distribution associated with each million board feet timber cut in the  region of origin. On a statewide basis, 7.68 (14,219 ~ 1852.13) people  were employed and 75.07 (139,046 ~ 1852.13) thousand dollars of wages a r e  associated with each million board feet of timber harvested and delivered  to Idaho.  4All multiplier calculations are similar. The following illustrates how  employment mul tipliers were calculated for regions :  Mij = [ (Tij ~ f;_ Tij) Ej] ~ ~ Tij  1 J  Where: Tij  Ej  Timber volume harvest (MMBF) in region (i) and delivered  to r egion (j) where j = 1 · ·· · 6, i = 1 ··· · 7 and i=7  is for imported timber .

Each multiplier should be interpreted  as before.  Construction of Tables 1-4 required two basic types of data. First,  the total pattern of timber cut and deliveries to counties in Idaho must  be known. These data were developed as part of the Idaho Forestry Industry  5 Study and are reported elsewhere. The second type of data needed concerns  employment and wage levels in Idaho's timber-using industry. These data  were also obtained as part of the overall industry study and are reported  6  elsewhere. With these data available, Tables 1-4 were constructed by  crediting employment and wages to state planning regions and counties on  the basis of the distribution of timber cut between origin and destination.  7  Tables 1-4 can be used in two major ways. First, the total direct  impace on employment and wages resulting from a proposed change in the  timber harvest level of a specific region or county can be determined.  Simply multiply the the anticipated change in harvest level for a specific  origin area times each multiplier included in that row; the sum of all  multiplications is a measure of the total direct impact on employment and  wages. The second major use of these tables is merely an extension of the  5Koss, William D., Ervin G. Schuster, and E. Bruce Godfrey. Idaho: timber  flow and future supply.

Information Series 6. 1974.  7  The reader should note that employment and wages when allocated in this  manner are not strictly comparable to the wages and employment data  recorded earlier (see footnote #6.) Employment and Wages in this publi­cation  emphasize origin of timber rather than destination or county (region)  of harvest vs. county of manufacture.  r  -14-  first. A left-hand column on each table shows the 1972 level of timber  harvest associated with each region or county. The extreme right-hand  column shows the result of multiplying each timber harvest level by  associated multipliers for that area of origin and then summing across the  row. Now, if an analyst wanted to determine total direct impacts in Idaho  of changing timber harvest in several areas, the following procedure is  appropriate: (a) identify and eliminate from consideration those areas  for which no harvest change is anticipated; (b) multiply anticipated new  harvest levels times the respective rows of multipliers and sum the products,  as outlined above; (c) develop a new total for the extreme right-hand  column by summing all rows; and (d) subtract the new total from the or-iginal  total -- this difference is a measure of total direct impact in  Idaho. Employment impacts so estimated, could then be used in conjunction  with economic base multipliers to ascertain probable aggregate (direct and  1. nd 1. rect ) 1. mpacts. 8  While many other uses likely exist for Tables 1-4, a word of caution  is in order. Data used to develop these tables pertain to 1972. As such,  they should be viewed as a one-time, snapshot of the relationship between  Idaho timber harvest and employment and wage levels in Idaho's forest  products industry. To the extent that 1972 was a nontypical year or that  Idaho's timber-using industry is characterized by excess capacity, mul-tipliers  should be viewed with added caution. Therefore, utilization of  these tables requires two major assumptions before assessment of future  8  schuster, ErvinG., Charles R. Hatch, and William D.

I •  These assumptions seem most reasonable when analysis is restricted to  modest changes in harvest levels and relatively short-range time horizons.  The multipliers contained in Tables 1-4 are designed to assist in  evaluation of alternative systems of land-management associated with  differing levels of timber harvest. Properly used, they will give an  indication of probable impacts, one alternative relative to another -- not  absolute impacts. As such, decision processes, based on more thorough  impact assessments will be enhanced .  •  I •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •",,,2014-09-03,2018-11-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/fwres/id/120,120,207.pdf,/fwres/image/207.pdf,fwres120

R. Canfield  D. L. Kulhavy  FOREST, WILDLIFE AND RANGE  EXPERIMENT STATION  John H. Ehrenreich  Director  A. A. Moslemi  Associate Director  Trees established on hardpan can be helped by punching holes in the  layer with a soil auger or a post-hole digger. If hol es of one to two  inches in diarreter are made, five to six holes per square yard should be  sufficient. If the holes are three to four inches in diameter , probably  one hole per square yard will be adequate. Drainage holes at these  spacings should be provided all around the tree to at l east three feet  beyond the drip line of the branches. All drainage holes should a:::m­pletely  penetrate the hardpan layer if possible. The holes should be  filled with sand or gravel to keep the clay fran filling them up again.  This procedure may have to be repeated in four to five years as the silt  particles forming the hardpan layer filter back into the sand- or gravel­f  illed holes.  When transplanting trees , a portion of the hardpan can be r erroved  and replaced with an appropriate soil mixture. Sane materials which  serve this purpose are native soil, sand, sawdust, peat rross, and leaf  rrold. A good mixture to begin with is 50 percent sawdust, leaf rrold or  peat rross , 15 percent sand, and 35 percent native soil. Place a quan­tity  of the mixture in a flower pot and soak it thoroughl y with water.  After the mixture is dry, test it for firmness . If it is hard and does  not readily accept water again, it has too much native soil. Conversely,  if water passes quickly through it then there is too much of one of the  other constituents. By experilrenting with mixtures and making these  s imple tests, a good mixture can be found .  Proper water management is the most important factor affecting birch  trees in Idaho, particularly in the southern portion where the St.mlT'erS  are hot and dry but regular irrigation is practiced. All trees should  2  l  be watered slowly so the water soaks down to the depths of tree roots .  Quick watering or light sprinkling may make the soil appear well watered  soon after the water is applied, but during the hot weather this arrount  of water is very quickly evaporated. On the other hand , even relatively  moderate amounts of water may lead to overwatering if soil drainage is  poor and the water is trapped by a clay layer below the surface.  Soil alkalinity and fertilization. In the mre arid regions of Idaho,  particularly the Snake River plains and the benches along the Boise  River Valley, the soil is alkaline. This condition causes a chemical  binding of many nutrients into fonns which make them unavailable to  plants. Iron is one of the mst ccmron nutrients bound up in this  marmer. Manganese, zinc, copper, magnesium and others are similarly  unavailable in alkaline soils. The mst econanical rrethod of correcting  these deficiencies is to use a carnplete fertilizer rather than adding  one nutrient at a time. Fertilizers are discussed further on page 9 .  DISEASE AND INSK'T DESCRIPI'IOOS  Birch dieback is the mst ccmron problem of ornamental birch trees. It  is a combination of inadequate care followed by the attack of a beetle  called the bronze birch borer (Agri U s anxius) • The mst conspi cuous  syrrptan of dieback is the dying of shoots and buds. The leaves dry and  turn brown fran the outer edges inward. The general appearance of the  tree is the dying and browning fran the top downward and fran the tips  of branches inward toward the trunk. The attack by the bronze birch  borer and the p:x:&gt;r health of the tree are explained separately below.  Remember that these conditions generally occur together and mst of the  syrrptans described can be found on the same tree.  3  The bronze birch borer is one of the nost devastating enemies of birch  trees, particularly those in poor vigor. This beetle occurs throughout  the range of birch. Adults are deep green-bronze in color and 1/2 to 1  inch (14-28 rrm) l ong. The pr~adult stage is a flattened grub, about 1-  1/2 inches (42 rrm) long with two spines at the head end.  The majority of the damage occurs  in stmmer and is caused by the grubs  making tunnels or galleries just  under the tree bark. This activity  girdles the trunk, causing death  to the parts of the tree above the  girdling.  The first noticeable syrrptans of the  borer attack are a dying back of the  tree-top and small round holes in  the bark caused by borer grubs. By  the time these syrrptans are present,  it is usually too late to apply any  control measures.  4  Birch Di eback is nearly always  associated with the bronze birch  borer. The dieback syrnptans are  also the usual symptoms for a  number of root disturbances.  These disturbances, which of ten  contribute t o the dieback, may  be root diseases or root damage caused by digging tools, soil can­paction,  drought, overwatering , or poor drainage . Frequently when  symptoms are advanced enough to be noticeable, the tree is so badly  injured that i t may not recover. This will not always be true in the  case of drought or overwatering . In these two instances, when water is  supplied in suffici ent quantity or, in the case of overwatering, witheld  to pennit sane drying out, the tree will produce new buds and eventu­ally,  new leaves. If the conditions of drought or overwatering persist  for a l ong period the tree dies .  Nectria cankers, (Nectria gaZZigena and related species), are widespread  in North America on hardwood trees. They do not often kill mature  trees , but smal l trees may be CCITq?letely girdled and die. The cankers  are uns i ghtly, but their chief danger to trees is the weakening of the  trunks and branches predisposing them to breaking by wind, ice, snow, or  other mechanical stresses.  The initial syrnptan of Nectria cankering is a reddish or darkened  area on the tree trunk with a watersoaked appearance around the opening  in the bark through which the f ungus entered the tree.  5  As the canker develops, the bark  over the entrance area dries and  cracks. Eventually, the cracked  bark f alls away and exposes the  underlying wocrl. Old cankers on  mature trees have a target-like  appearance, while on young trees  they are usually areas of deep  depression, almost like holes,  surrounded by rings of 'WOCXly  tissue.  During nnist -weather in the fall  small white tufts of fungus mate­r  ial protrude through cracks in  the bark on and around the can-kered  area. About the same time  tiny round or oval red fruiting  bodies, arout the size of a pinhead, appear in the center and around the  edges of the canker. When these fruiting bodies mature, their spores  are ejected and are carried away by wind and rain. The spores can cause  infection of other trees.  Cytospora canker, Cytospora chrysosperma (VaZ.sa sor dida ) , This fungus  has two names as indicated above but it is usually r eferred to as  ""Cytospora. "" Spores of the fungus mvade the trunk and branches of  ch trees through wounds in the bark. I""lfections begin as nnre or  6  less circular, sunken, disoolored  areas of bark called cankers; the  wood beneath the discolored bark  is frequently brown rather than  white or green. As the fungus  rr.a.tures it forms small, dark,  pirrple-like fruiting stl:uctures  on the bark oovering the cankers.  During wet or humid weather red­dish  or yello.vish tendrils erupt fran the fruiting stl:uctures and  fonn tiny curled nasses resenbling the tendrils on peas. Each tiny  tendril contains thousands of spores, and each spore is capable of  inciting a new infection if it chances to land in a favorable place.  TWigs, small branches, and even small trees are often girdled and  killed by this fungus. If a number of branches or twigs are infected at  nearly the same time the over-all appearance of the tree nay resembl e  birch dieback or severe drought.  Birch aphids congregate on leaves and twigs where they obtain food by  sucking the sap fran plant tissue. A sticky, shiny substance, called  honeydew, is usually found on leaves and on objects under the tree; this  is the excrement of aphids. The attacked leaves are small and wrinkled.  Nurrerous small green aphids are usually present, congregated on the underside  of leaves. Unchecked by predators or parasites, tremendous numbers  of aphids nay be produced during the sUrrrre.r. As ¥rinter approaches,  winged males and females are produced; these adults mate and produce  eggs which overwinter on tw1gs and SMall branches.  7  Birch leaf miner (F'enusa pus i lla) ,  Larvae of this leaf-mining wasp  f eed on tissues between the leaf  surfaces. Young larvae form kid­ney-  shaped mines which coalesce  and form large wrinkled, hollowed­out  brown areas in the leaves.  Leaves turn brown and brittle, but older foliage may not be affected.  Larvae, when mature, drop fran the leaves and transform to the adult in  the soil.  Larvae of the birch skeletonizer, BuccuZatrix canadensieZZa , a leaf­mining  noth, feed fran late July through August. Young larvae enter the  leaves to feed, making serpentine (s-shaped) tunnels; later they emerge  and f orm small webs on the underside of leaves . After their feeding,  only a skeleton of the leaf remains. Heavy infestations cause severe  defoliation. Later, they fall to the ground where they overwinter. The  adults emerge fran their cocoons in spring and lay eggs on t he leaves.  IRON CHLO:OOSIS AND OI'HER PIDBLEMS  Iron chlorosis and same other mineral deficiencies are caused by a  chemical condition which binds the minerals in forms which make them  unavailable to plants . Iron is only one of several minerals essential  for the growth of all green plants.  The syrnptan of iron chlorosis, often called iron deficiency , is a  conspicuous yellawing of the l eaves with the leaf veins remaining green.  Deficiencies of magnesium, sulphur, and saret.i.rres even calcium, produce  8  symptoms which may resembl e those of iron deficiency. Therefore,  mineral deficiencies should be treated with a complete fertilizer con­taining  as many of the nutrient elanents as possible. The constituents  of fertilizers are listed on the package. Jlbst fertilizers contain  nitrogen, phosphorus , and potassium which are indicated by three numbers  on the package. The first of these numbers is the percentage of nitro­gen  that the fertilizer contains; the second is the percentage of  phosphorus and the third is the percentage of potassium or potash. The  micronutrients, i.e. , those required in small arrounts, are listed on  another part of the package.  Drought, overwatering, or poor drainage. Drought, or lack of water,  is familiar to rrost people. But overwatering and/ or poor drainage which  produce drought-like symptans are not generally recognized. Overwatering  is simply applying too much water. H~ver, even rroderate arrounts of  water can produce similar symptoms and tree death if soil drainage is  poor.  Herbicides, or weed killers, invade trees and shrubs in U..U primary ways.  One is through the l eaves which have a(X:fUired the damaging chemical fran  drifting spray. Many garden chemicals may drift hundreds of yards or  even miles on a wind or breeze that is scarcely noticeable. Another  entrance route of herbicides is through the root system. This happens  when a ""weed and feed"" fertilizer is applied to lawn grasses in arrounts  greater than rec:x:mrvanded or, perhaps, by mistakes or accidents with the  spreader or other mechanical applicator. A rrore ccmron occurrence is  the intentional application of chemicals on noxious ~ in areas near  9  enough to trees to enter the root systen. Weeds along driveways, side­walks,  and fences are especially targets of this kind of application.  The leaves or needles of trees which have been subjected to air­rome  chemicals are usually twisted, curled, and deformed; often they  are so distorted that they cannot be recognized as belonging to the tree  on which they are found. In addition to the malformations, such leaves  are discolored, usually pale green or yell&lt;M and sanetimes with darker  green streaks. Trees absorbing these chemicals through the roots have  similar symptans but may have :rrore extremes in the discolorations,  sanetimes approaching white or extremely pale yel l&lt;M.  DIAGNOSIS AND TREA'IMENT  The foll&lt;Ming pages present a table of injuries, diseases , and  damages occurring on birch trees . In the first column the injuries are  divided into two groups, (1) those that occur on foliage (leaves) and ,  ( 2) those that occur on trunks and branches as well as leaves. The  second column gives the name of the disease or insect causing the  injw:y; the third column gives a reccmrended treatment.

Forest, Wildlife and Range  Lf~ Experiment Station  , Moscow, Idaho  Station Paper No. 5  December, 1968  SUMMARY  Hadioisotope tracer technique was employed in an experiment  involving foot development and survival of out-planted ponderosa  pine seedlings. Native vegetation was either not distrubed or else  removed within circles of 12-, 36-, and 50-inch diameters around  the young trees. Phosphorus32 was injected into the soil and periodic  determinations were made of radioactivity levels in the foliage of  seedlings and competing plants in order to ascertain the presence  of roots in the isotope injection zone and the amount of absorptive  activity OccllITing,  On undisturbed microsites, survival of seedlings was only 48  percent after the first growing season, compared to 77 to 85 pe r­cent  on scalped sites. Unusually beneficial weather conditions prob­ably  prevented the particular size of the scalped area from exert­ing  much influence on survival or on leader growth.  Higher rates of p:~~ absorption were found on scalped areas. On  undisturbed sites the low values found could have been caused  both by poor root growth resulting from severe competition and  by removal of p"" from the soil reservoir by the other vegetation.  Hadioactivity in foliage indicated that roots of seedlings reached  a depth of at least 24 inches during the first growing season. Max­imull""  l lateral extension was only 6 inches at the 24-inch depth, but  at least 12 inches at 8- and 16-inch depths.  The seedlings obtained most of their foliar p3~ froll) the injection  placement zones located at 3- and 8-inch soil depths, one inch from  the root collar. Considerable uptake also occurred in the zones also  located 1 inch in a lateral direction from the plant, but at 16 and 24  inch soil depths. A deep, narrow systen'l of most-active roots was  indicated by this pattern of recovery.  Analysis of foliage samples from the native vegetation provided  inforrnation regarding magnitude of con""lpetition from grasses, forbs,  and shrubs established considerable distances from the seedlings.  Some such plants which definitely showed radioactivity were grow­ing  at least 24 inches from the isotope placement sites. Grasses ab­sorbed  more p"" from deeper placements than did forbs and  shrubs; Forbs and shrubs were more effective in absorption at  greater lateral distances.  These res ults indicate that both the specific type of competing  vegetation expected and the rooting pattern of the tree seedlings  should be considered when planning site preparation and assessing  results of planting programs .  . , ';. .• ,''"" .• - ,"" "" i' ~ I -.

Pitkin'  INTRODUCTION  There are approximately 52 million acres of unstocked commercial  forest land in the United States (U. S. Dept. of Agr., 1958 ), and this  represents 11 percent of the total commercial forest area. Attempts to  restock land in the westenl mountain region are harnpered by a lack  of knowledge concerning the behavior of the various factors involved in  seedling establishment. Development of root systems, in particular, is  poorly understood. Conventional root observation techniques generally  involve excavation of specimens, and this obviously prevents continued  study of the development of these same plants. Moreover, such excava­tions  are slow and laborious even on young trees, particularly because  every treatment requires replications. The lack of a less time-consuming  method has hampered investigations of root systems in the past.  Radioisotope technique provides a way to examine roots in situ.  without disturbing the plant. Most studies using radioisotopes to trace  root systems have involved agricultural crops ( Hall, et 011953; Hammes  and Bartz, 1963; Mathis, Jaynes, and Thomas, 1965 ). There have been  few attempts to utilize the method in forestry. Karpov (1962) used  phosphorus'"" to study the amount of competition between roots of  dense-standing birch ( Betula DeTTucosa) and seedlings of Norway spruce  ( Picea abies (L. ) Karst ). Seedlings planted with a 40-cm trench excav­ated  around them would, within 14 days, absorb 5 times more p'"" than  those without adjacent t.renches. Smaller root systems on the trees with­out  trenches were as active per unit surface area as the larger systems.  He concluded that the size of root systems, rather than phosphorous re­moval  by competition, was the limiting factor.  Rates of uptake and translocation were studied by Moreland (1950)  Loblolly pine ( Pillus taeda, L ) translocated p"" at rates up to 1.2 meters  per hour; lateral roots moved the isotope more rapidly than stems.  \1uch of the phosphorus added to soil, whether it is radioactive or  not. quickly reverts to an unavailable form. However, even a relatively  large lIptake of p:i::! will not injure plant tissue. Stanton and Sinclair  ( 1953 ) indicate that single buds from plum trees were not damaged, al­lhough  they contained up to 3 mc of the isotope. This quantity involves  over 100,000 disintegrations per second, but as few as 5 or 10 disintegra­tions  per minute can be detected with a well-shielded gas-flow Geiger  Counter. Thus an extremely small amount of isotope in a leaf is sufficient  to verify the location of a root, and the actual amount of translocation to  1 Published with the approval of the Director, Forest, Range and Wil dlife experi­ment  Station, University of Idaho, Moscow.  2 Professor of Forestry, fonner Research Fellaow, and Assot.!iate Professor of  Forestry. respectively.  3  UNIV£RSlTY Of IWAII L B  the leaf need not be nearly as great when using a radioisotope than when  using something more difficult to detect. In addition, because such low  quantities of radiotracers can be accluately recorded, only minimal  amounts of the material need be added to the soil.  The investigation detailed in this paper was designed to ascertain  the effects of various levels of competition on rooting and survival of  planted two-year-old ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa Douglas) . A  radiotracer, p :12, was used to reveal patterns of root development.  PROCEDURE  During May of 1965, a plot was established on the University-of-Idaho  Forest (Big Meadow Creek Unit ) near Troy, Idaho, in an area vegetated  with grass, forbs, and small shrubs. Important species represented were:  a. Shrubs  Snowberry ( Symphoricarpos spp.)  Willow (Salix spp.)  Ninebark ( Ph,/socarpos "",a'vaceu"", Green, (Kuntz )  Barberry ( Berberis repens Lindl. )  b. Forbs  Aster (Aster consp icuous Lindl. )  Yarrow (Achillea /anu !osa lItt. )  Dogbane (Apocynum pumilum Gray, Greene)  c. Grasses  Pinegrass (Caiamagrostis rebescens Buckl. )  Idaho fescue ( Festuca idahoensis Elmer. )  Billeblinch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum Pursch, Schribn. and  Smith )  Sedges (Ca1""8x spp. )  The site was located on a 5 per cent west-facing slope. The soil was  classified in the Santa series, transitional between the western brown  forest and brown podzolic great soil groups. It had a prominantiy­leached  A, horizon, a nearly impermeable fragipan at a 24-inch depth,  and a high percentage of silt-sized volcanic ash. Texture of the soil above  the fragipan was silt loam, with a 15-atmosphere water holding per­centage  of 8.1 and a 1/3 atmosphere percentage of 33.2.  The area was first di vided into four blocks. Within each block, micro­sites  were developed representing four competition levels:  a. Control, no vegetation removed.  h. Circular scalp, removing all vegetation within a circle of 12-inch  diameter.  c. Circular scalp, 36-inch diameter.  d. Circlilar scalp, 50-inch diameter.  Forty-eight microsites of each size were randomly distributed within  each block, one 2-0 ponderosa pine seedling ( root-prllned to 9 inches  and graded at the nursery for uniformity) being planted in the center  of each microsite.  4  Ini tial injections of carrier-free p3:! were made to the soil around the  individual trees in late June. Three probes, of the type described by  Loewenstein (1965), were employed to carry out this operation. These  were constructed of stainless steel tubing, 1/4 inch in cliameter and about  30 inches long. Outlet ports for discharge were located slightl y above  the tips, and glass syringes set to deliver 5 ml of solution (concentration  15 uc/ml ) per injection were attached to the tops. These syringes were  connected to 500-ml plastic reservoir bottles supported by a shelf at­tached  to the upper part of the probe sheath.  Injections were made in a circular pattern around individual trees  according to the treatment scheme outlined in Table 1. In each block,  one tree of each age class received a particular treatment. Injections  were spaced around the circle so as to give 20 percent coverage of a  ""tube"" of soil at the particular depth indkated by treatment. This degree  of coverage has been used in agricultural tracer experiments and was the  maximum deemed possible because of isotope cost considerations.  Table 1. Outline of treatments involved in experiment. Soil injections  of p32 were made in a circular pattern at the indicated distances from  root collars of 2-0 ponderosa pine seedlings.

These were marked at equal distance around the circum­ference;  2 marks for I -inch radius circles, 10 for 6-inch, 20 for 12-inch.  In practice, the hoops were placed on the ground, with the tree at  the exact center-point. Injections were then made in soil adjacent to  each mark on the hoop with the probe inserted to the required depth.  Utilizing three probes, it was possible to complete the entire injection  procedure in one day.  5  One week after injection. and at weekly intervals throughout the 1965  growing season, needle samples were collected from the trees. To help  ascertain the degree of competition to the seedlings from other plants  outside the scalped zones, weekly collections were made of leaves from  several species located 2 and 3 feet from the trees planted on 11 of the  36-inch diameter scalps. Each of these microsites had received a differ­ent  one of the 11 isotope injection treatments. Presence and level of ra­dioactivity  in all samples were deterrnined through use of a Nuclear­Chicago  automatic gas-flow counting system. Rates of activity were  recorded in counts-per-minute per 10 mg of oven·dry tissue so that all  data were comparable.  Radiotracer data were used for two purposes:  L As an indication of the part of the seedling root zone where maxi­mum  absorption of p"" (and thus presumably other compounds )  were taking place. The Relative Activity of needle tissue was oh­tained  at each sampling time hy diViding the radioactivity found  for each seedling hy the total activity found for all seedlings and  multiplying by 100. The figures obtained in this way were inter­preted  in the following manner; A plant with high relative radio­activity  in its needles was judged to have had either many roots,  or at least very actively-absorbing roots, in the zone of isotope  placement. Foliage of low relative radioactivity would indicate  that the plant had few roots, or at least very inactively-absorhing  roots, in the isotope placement zone involved.  2. As an indication of the degree of competition to seedlings exerted  hy plants located olltside the scalped zones. Presence of radio­activity  in foliage of grasses, forbs, and shrubs would indicate  that their roots extended into the zone of isotope placement.  Tree survi val was recorded weekly; leader growth was measured at  the end of the first growing season. These determinations were repeated  in the fall of 1966 (after the second growing season).  Soil moisture levels on all four kinds of microsites were monitored  by weekly resistance readings of gypsum blocks. These blocks were in­serted  in depth-lateral zones corresponding to each p"" placement. A  calibration curve was used to convert resistance to percent moisture.  RESULTS  Because of the fragipan located 24 inches below the surface, the soil  at 1eadow Creek is limited in its total water-holding capacity. Any water  in excess of the field capacity of the soil above this layer is lost through  rllnoff and lateral percelation. A soil monolith taken near the plot in  late May of 1965, when soil moisture was at a maximum, showed no  living roots and very little water helow the dense fragipan.  Some rain fell during nearly every week of the growing season ( Figure  1. ) This frequent precipitation was undoubtedly in part responsible for  maintaining good soil-moisture supplies where trees were planted on  microsites scalped of competing vegetation. Results of a study on a  6  similar site, made in a very dry year, showed that even 36·inch scalps  fa iled to enhance survival of Douglas-fir seedlings (Loewenstein and  Pitkin, unpublished ). In the current experiment, a high percentage of  the planted seedlings survived on scalped microsites ( Figure 2.) Where  no scalp was constructed, only 48 percent of the trees were alive by  November 15. Scalps of 12, 36, and 60 inches all proved benefi cial, with  survival ranging from 77 to 85 percent at the end of the first growing  season.  .~.. It:  ~  I-  .""  (5  ~  -'  (5  '""  .E  +.=..

By  October 11, the entire soil profiles of control and 12-inch scalped micro­sites  were depleted of all available moisture. Profiles of the larger  scalped areas retained available moisture at all depths through the whole  growing season.  In 1965, leader growth of the seedlings was only to a minor degree  affected by the removal of competing vegetation. By fall, the leader  length of seedlings growing on large 36- and 6O-inch scalps averaged  just 0.2 inch more than that of seedlings growing on control and 12-inch  scalp microsites.  7  IOOr-----------------------------~  !~... 80  70  60 G-&lt;O&gt; NO SCALP  _-0 12"" SCALP  50 '""-"" 36"" SCALP  0--0 60· SCALP  40  7/5 8/2 9/6 10/4 11/15  DATE  Figure 2.

Table 2 sbows the amount of radioactivity (corrected for decay and  mortality ) present in foliage of trees growing on the four competition  level microsites as determined on November 15. The values are the  summation of data for 44 samples (10 mg each ), or 440 mg of tissue.  Control trees contained no detectable radioactivity at this time, but these  on 50-inch scalps had retained some 14,596 cpm/440 mg tissue. If these  findings are a valid indication of root activity, the latter seedlings  possess superior rooting systems. This factor should be refl ected in su-­peri  or survival and growth in subsequent years. Measurements taken  after the second growing season (fall, 1966) shows that this superiority is  indeed being manifest. No further mortality was experienced on the 60-  inch diameter scalps, but survival on control microsites decreased frorn  the 48 percent recorded at the end of the first growing season to 27 per­cent  at the end of the second.

For example, seedlings from 6O-inch  diameter scalped zones bore leaders averaging 4.7 inches after the second  growing season, compared to an average of but 2.1 inches for seedlings  frorn unscalped microsites.  Highest foliar p 32 content was found in seedUngs growing on soil  injected 1 inch from the stems. On October 11, for example, the greatest  activity occurred in the l x8-inch injection treatment, followed by the lx3,  lx16, and l x24-inch treatments in that order (Table 3). The trees from  l x8 and l x3-inch injection sites absorbed considerably more than those  from sites having deeper isotope placement. However, even the seed­lings  from the lx24-inch treatment had foliage higher in radioactivity  than the plants growing on sites injected at shallower depth but greater  lateral distance from the stem. Trends evidenced on this date were  similar to those found during other weeks. These results in total indicate  that the pine seedlings in the first growing season after planting tended  to develop relatively deep but narrow root systems.  Rates of 1)'"" absorption by seedlin ~s on the Big Meadow Creek plot  indicated the occurrence of considerable competition between the  voun~ trees and other vegetation. A higher rate of p52 absorption was  found throughout the summer in trees on scalped sites, as compared  to trees on unscalped microsites ( Figure 3). At least two factors could  have contributed to these results. Competition for moisture by other  vel!etat'on on unscalped sites may have adversely affected the root  proliferation and activity of seedlings, thus affecting uptake of p"". Also,  Table 3.

The data presented  below show that even plants growing some distance from the treated  areas were extending roots into the zone of isotope placement. This being  true, competition by vegetation growing in close proximity to the seed­lings  must have been especiall y strong.  Foliar samples from vegetation surrounding the seedlings growing  on 36-inch scalps were periodically analyzed for presence and level of  radioactivity. The data indicated rooting habits of the grasses, forbs,  and shrubs on the plot and the magnitude of competition from such  plants located a considerable distance from the tree seedlings. Shrubs  absorbed 87.8 percent of the total paz found in all competing plants.  Forbs and grasses obtained only 7 percent and 5.2 percent respectively.  :..z.:.  el.  OJ  Q  .=o,  SHRUBS  Figure 4.

Values are based on percent of the total radioactivity found  in foliage of all plants of a particular vegetation type. The uptake pattern  also indicated that lateral root extension of grasses was less than that of  shrubs or forbs ( Figure 5 ).

The grasses absorbed considerably less p 3t from the 24·inch distance than  did th e other 2 groups of plants.  12  These data concerning competing plants are of particular interest  when reviewing the problems concerning seedling survival, especially in  growing seasons of average or below average precipitation.  It is often thought that removing vegetation from a small zone around  the seedlings will greatly lessen the chance of mortality. This concept  frequently proves false, however, and reasons given for planting failures  the numerous. Often overlooked in such reasoning is the possibility of  marked competition with seedlings from plants outside the scalped  zones. Information presented here clearly indicates that such competition  exists, and that tree seedlings and plants growing at least 2 feet, and  possibly more, from them are exploiting the same rooting zone. The  dominant type of competing vegetation on a site and the rooting pat·  tern of the planted seedHngs are also factors of considerable significance.  This study indicates, for example, that most root activity of ponderosa  pine seedlings during the first growing season after outplanting occurs  in the upper 8 inches or so of soil. Especially in a dry year, then, compe­tition  on scalped areas from forbs and shrubs should be greater than  from grasses, which exploited the 16·inch depth zone to the greatest  extent.

Streamside vegetation  dominated by white alder makes a significant floral  contribution to the aesthetics of an outdoor exper ience;  certainly the dense alder stands affect the amount and  quality of water delivered to the main streams. Further,  these stream bottoms, surrounded by grasslands, are  important habitats for a wide var iety of wildlife. In areas  grazed by domestic livestock, heavy use of stream bottoms  is made by animals seeking water and shade. Both the  importance of these white alder dominated streams and  potential conflicts in the ir use are clear.  Land usc patterns along the Snake and Salmon rivers,  are changing. Each year thousands of people float down  the rugged stretches of these canyons. The Middle Snake  has been designated a National Recreation Area, while the  Salmon is a strong candidate for wi ld/scenic river status.  Recreation use of these rivers will assuredly increase.  Land managers are well aware that the prime camping and  hi king areas for boaters are the perennial side streams.  These tributaries often contain the only trails providing  access in and out of the canyons. Campers concentrate  the ir activit ies on the side streams, seeking water and  shade as well as fis hi ng opportun ities and a chance to  observe wildlife. Thus, the understanding of the ecological  to lerance of while alder and other ripar ian vegetation will  become increasingly essential to land management  decisions.  1JIIIVIRSIff OF IDAHO UBRA,  Aerial photography may provid e a rapid and relatively  inexpensive means of collecting data on the species and  the communities it inhabits. Color aerial ph otography  seems to have the most promising potential.  Although much work has been done in the field of  color aerial photographic interpretation, no aerial photo  interpretation studies have been conducted specifically on  white alder. One study using multispectral color aerial  pho tography in California {Yost and Wende roth 1969} did  report identification of white alder by color differences  on a multispectral photograph. However, this study was  mainly concerned with di ffere ntiation of three other  species, two of which were coniferous.  O BJECTIVES  The primary goal of this stu dy was to objective ly  evaluate the feasibility of using 70 mm vert ical aerial  photography to locate populations of white alder in  tributaries to the Snake, Salmon, and Clearwater river  drainages. In add ition, if the 70 mm format proved useful,  th en the best scale to use, the type of film (true color or  color IR), and the feasibility of us ing Munsell Color Chart  descript ions to identify alder and associated species would  be determined. Realization of the objectives of th is study  would provide basic information on the proper aerial  photographic methods for determining the presence of  white alder in riparian communities. This information  would hopefully reduce the cost of ground data  acqu isition in stu dies of these areas.  STUDY AREA  Allison Creck in the Salmon River drainage was  chosen as the tributary to be sampled. This drainage is  located approx imately 15 km (9 river miles) due cast  of Riggins, Idaho. Allison Creek flows into the Salmon at  an elevation of 548 m {1808 ft}. The stud y area included  that portion of the creek from the mouth to an elevation  823 m {2700 ft} . This re presents ap prox imately 4.8 km  {3 miles} as measured on the road along the creek.  White alder dominates the overs tory of vegetation  along the creek to the upper end of th e study area. An  examination of the creek vegetation beginning at the  mouth indicated th at white alder is found in association  with hackberry (Celtis reticulata), syringa (Philadelphus  lewisii), black cOllonwood (Populus trichocarpa), western  2  serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), willows (Salix  red-osier dogwood (Comus stolon if era), bird (  (Prunus avium), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesi  glauca), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), blueberry  (Sambucus cerulea), snowberry (Symphoricarpos (  Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum) black hawtl  (Crataegus douglasii), ocean-spray (HolodiscuS disc.  and water bi rch (Betula occidentalis). The presenc,  abundance of these species change on an ~ elevat  gradient. Adjacent to the riparian vegetation of the stl  bottom, the communities vary in composition from bl  grass at the mouth of the creek to Grand fir/C/in  uniflora hab itat type2 at the upper end of the study  Douglas-fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, white  water birch, bird cherry, black cottonwood, blue  elder and black hawthorne were chosen as the  species be cause of their abu ndance in rit:  communities. Test trees were located in a m.  designed to reduce the possi bili ty of introduced bi.,  to their relation with ph ysiographic or cultural fear  Aerial Photography  The study arca was photographed on 23 OCI  1974. Field experience indicated that the fall of the  was the optimum time for obtaining color and calc  imagery for identi fying white a lder. Because alder rer  in green leaf stage longer than any of the associated  species in riparian communi ties, color differences bet  species would be maximized during this season.  A Graflex-X L camera with 100 mm lens and 7C  film back was used. The films used were K  aerochrome 2448 {true color} and Kodak aeroch  infrared 2443 {color I R}. The aircraft flown was a C  206, equipped with a porthole over which a handl  mount was placed for obtaining ve rt ical photograph,  overflights of th e area were made to gather true  imagery at four scales and color I R imagery at 1:  and 1 :3960 scales. The photographic scales for true  were 1 :3960, 1 :7920, 1 :15,840, and 1 :31,680 {Fi!  These scales were ground checked for accuracy. Pt  were ex posed to obtain a 60 percent overlap for s  viewing.

However, this fact would not negate the  results of the experiment, because known ecological  tol erances help delimit the species. For example, in Idaho,  present studies indicate that white alder does not occur  above 940 m (3100 ft) whereas thin leaf alder occurs  primari ly above this elevation. This fact provides  information as to the identity of white alder in the  imagery.  Photo Interpretation  By utilizing the ground data checked with the black  and white prints, test species were marked on ace tate  overlays placed on the 70 mm transparencies.  An interpretation handbook was prepared utilizing  botanical descripti ons useful in identifying northern  Minnesota tree species (Heller et al. 1964). Although the  species were di ffe rent in Minnesota, the descri ptions of  crown apices, crown margins and foliage characteristics  were readily adaptable to this study (Figs. 2 and 3).  A dichotomous key for true color and color I R was  prepared utilizing vegational characteristics and color  differences (Tables 1 and 2).  Three inexperienced aer ial photo interpreters were  selected and given 1 hour of training in the use of the  interpretation handbook and stereo viewing techniques.  Since these interpreters were withOllt experience and had  minimum training, they represent the supposed lower  limit of interpreter ability in a study of this type.  A color·comparator (Heller et al. 1964) consisting of  Munse ll color charts on 35 mm transparencies and a  reflection system that gathers the same kind of light  pass ing through the 70 mm transparencies, was used to  determine the proper Munsell hue/value/chroma of each  test tree. This represents a method of color determination  superior to the use of Munsell color chips and reflected  light.  The transparencies were viewed with a 2.25-powcr  stereoscope on a fluorescent light·tabl e. Each interpreter  used the same ligh t source and stereoscope for all  interpretation. Data were recorded on prepared forms.  Table 1. Key to Species: (k1 TrUe Color Aerial POOtography,  I . Color of fOliage green  a. c:ra..n acuninate, acute or obtuse ••• Califerous  aa.

Because some of the pl anned imagery was not  .:ained due to camera malfunctions, sufficient  lications for all the test species were not avai lable. The  est (Sakal and Rohl f 1969) was selected as an  ropriate non parametric statistic for evalu ation of the  a.  Examination of the tables indicated that significant  -ialian between interpreters existed. For each  !rpreter the following comparisons were made: for  or film, three scales (1 :15,840, 1 :7920, 1 :3960) were  npared for each of seven species. The 1 :31,540 color  tgery was interpreted by the principal author and  .jectively analyzed for usefulness. These analyses  .vided a basis for accepting or rejecting the following  )otheses:  1. Is there any statistical difference in accuracy  between true color fi lm and co lor I R? On the  bas is of correct-incorrect responses for the five  species common between the tables for true  color and color I R film (Table 5), the G-test  showed a statistically valid improvement in  interpreter ""s responses with color I R. However,  with only white alder under consideration, the  stat istical analysis showed no basis for a  significant difference between true color and  color I R fi lm .  Comparison of correc t-incorrect responses in  Table 5 shows that interpreter 2 had problems  differentiating ponderosa pine and bird cherry  regardless of film type. Interpreter 3 had  difficulty in identifying bird cherry on true color  film and ponderosa pine on color I R.  True color film is recommended to reduce costs  and to increase utility of photos (transparencies)  for other purposes.  2. Does anyone scale provide a statistically valid  improvemen t in accuracy? The G-test shows that  7  for the five species marked with an asterisk in  Tables 3 and 4, interpreters 1 and 2 did not  improve their determination accuracy at anyone  scale. The same test shows that in terpreter 3 did  significantly better at the 1 :7920 scale.  3. Is there any difference in accuracy between the  1 :3960 and 1 :7920 scales? For the seven species  marked X in Table 4, the G-test shows that  interpreter 3 did significantly bettcr at the  1 :7920 scale; in terpreters 1 and 2 had equal  results for both scales. The correct-incorrect  responses in the tables show that interpreters 1  and 2 had difficulty determining birch and cherry  regardless of scale (Table 4).  4. Is there a difference in correct determination of  white alder for anyone scale? Eva luation of the  white alder correct-incorrect responses (Tables 3  and 4) by the G-tests shows that interpreters 1 and  3 did not perform significantly better at anyone  scale. Interpreter 2 did improve in identifying  alder at the 1 :3960 scale. The correct-incorrect  responses for white alder in Tabl es 3, 4, and 5  show that white alder is more consistently  identified than the other species.  5. Is the 1 :31,540 scale useful for identification of  species? Subjective evaluation of correct-incorrect  responses of the principal author's in terpreta tion  for this scale indicates that the 1 :31,540 scale is  too small for consistent determination of any  species common in riparian communities or even  major forest types. Although this test had no  statistical control, this indication is supported by  experiences of others using small-scale aerial  photos for species distribution.  6. Table 6 indicates the general areas on a Munsell  Hu e/Chroma graph where the interpreters  designated each species. These points ind icate  that alder only broadly compares in color with  the coniferous species. This fact should improve  accuracy of species determination, since the  vegetative characteristics of white alder and the  coniferous species are vastly different.  Table 3.

Subjective eva luation  of the data indicates that for white alder, the 1 :3 '1,540  scale is too small for useful data gathering, Statistical  analysis of the data supports th e view that for  determining the presence of alder in the fa ll of the year,  the 1: 15,840 scale and true color film are adequate.  Progressively larger-scale photography coupled with  increased interpreter training would be necessary to  provide accurate information regarding the composition of  communities dominated by alder.  Figure 1 illustrates the differences in image size for  three scales.  Regardless of scale or film type, bird cherry and  water birch arc difficu lt to differentiate due to their color  and structural similarities.  RECOMMENDATIONS  For an ae rial survey to determine the prcscl1CLT ""f  white alder in riparian communities, 70 mm vertical r··~""  color aerial photography taken in the fall of the year  1 :15,840 scale would be adequate for identifying""  al der with nearly 100 percent accuracy if ex perienced  interpreters were used.  12  F or detailed information regarding vegeta  composition of white alder dominated communitie  density of alder stands, a larger scale, such as 1::  would be more accurate.

As a  result, the Interior Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began a  review to determine the status of the otter in the United States . At that  time, only a meager amount of scientific data was available for use in  assessing the otter's status. State agencies soon realized they knew little  about otter density and distribution in their states. This prompted a new  interest in otter research throughout the country, in turn creating a need  for useful research techniques .  We have conducted research on river otter in west-central Idaho since  June 1976. During this time, we have developed certain techniques that may  be useful to researchers who wish to capture, handle, mark, instrument and  census river otter.  Some of these techniques will be widely applicable, while others likely  will need modification to conform to the area.  CAPTURE METHODS  In other studies, a variety of methods have been employed to capture  river otter without harming the animals. Most sets do not require bait since  otter generally catch their own food. In Michigan, otter were obtained for  pen studies by removing young from a den, live-trapping them using #4 jump­traps  on spring poles, and through the use of wire landing nets (Harger 1961).  Stephenson (pers. comm.) used #2 jump-traps successfully in Ontario, Canada.  In Newfoundland, Canada, Hancock 1ivetraps were effectively used to capture  river otter (Northcott and Slade 1976), while the Bailey 1ivetrap proved very  ineffective. In Pennsylvania, Eveland (1978) tested the feasibility of foot  snares, padded #3 Victor jump-traps, and #2 double 10ngspring traps, as well  as the Hancock 1ivetrap. Three captures were made in the leg-hold traps,  with a suspected 21 escapes . Although Eveland only experimented with these  traps on a limited basis, he felt that foot snares, when properly modified,  could provide a safe, effective, and easy-to-use trapping method for river  otter. In this study, a variety of trap designs have been used to capture otter .  Leg-hold Trap  We began in June 1976, using only leg-hold traps. After June 1977, these  traps were used only in certain situations (e.g., where preferred traps could  1  not be used). When set in places where otter were known to be present the  traps were usually kept under continuous surveillance. Nine captures were  made in leg-hold traps, five in #2 coi1spring traps, four in #3 jump-traps.  Two juvenile otter, captured in #3 traps, suffered broken hind legs and  eventually died. A third juvenile otter caught twice in a #3 jump-trap  suffered only some swelling in the toes. Very little injury occurred to  otter captured in #2 traps. The disadvantage of leg-hold traps this size  is that otter' frequently escaped by pulling out. We experienced at least  35 escapes from #2 coi1spring traps .  Advantages: Small, light, easily transported, and can be set in a wide  variety of locations.  Disadvantages: Non-target species may be caught and seriously injured .  There is always the risk of serious injury to trapped otter, especially  since they often violently fight the trap .  Foot Snare  One Aldrich foot snare was used on this study for a short period of time.  It was sprung once by an otter that escaped. The potential for this capture  technique is not really known.  Advantages: Like leg-hold traps, foot snares are small and can be set  in places where larger traps cannot be placed. They are easily transported  to less accessible areas.  Disadvantages: Non-target species may be caught and seriously injured.  There is also the possibility of injury to a captured otter. Injury may  be reduced if snares and leg-hold traps are used in conjunction with a spring  pole. Further experimentation in this area is necessary.  Tomahawk Trap  Large two-door Tomahawk traps measuring 107 cm x 41 cm x 38 cm have  been tested only recently. Thus far, one capture has been made, when a trap  was placed over the entrance to a cavity in to which one of our instrumented  otter had retreated. Two captures of juvenile otter approximately 3.6 kg  each were made in small single-door Tomahawk traps measuring 51 cm x 20 cm x  20 cm. These traps, baited with fish, had been set for mink (MusteZa vison).  Advantages: The large Tomahawk trap may be effective when placed in  runways or tunnels leading to dens. Non-target species can be released ·  unharmed. This trap can still be used during freezing weather.  Disadvantages : The trap is large and bulky, but light. It can be used  only in certain places. Because it is easily sprung, non-target species can  become a nuisance. The trap may not be strong enough to hold a large otter  for any length of time.  2  I  1  J  Culvert Trap  Four traps were made using 1.2 m sections of 30 cm diameter aluminum  culvert in 1977. Spring-loaded doors were placed at each end. The  trigger mechanism was similar to the kind used on conibear traps. These traps,  though not extensively used, resulted in the capture of a yearling male otter.  Advantages: Trap can be set in shallow, running water without being  sprung by the current. Small animals, such as muskrats (Ondatra zibethica)  can pass through without springing the trap.  Disadvantages: The trap is large and bulky, but light. Otter were  often reluctant to enter, choosing, instead, to go around the trap. Because  of its size, the trap can only be used in certain locations.  Barrel Trap  These traps were designed by personnel of the Idaho Cooperative Wildlife  Research Unit for use on wolverine (GuZo guZo). They were made from barrel  drums 91 cm and 74 cm long, with a diameter of 46 cm . A sliding door is  triggered when the animal pulls on the bait suspended at the back of the trap.  These traps were used extensively during the fall, winter, and spring of  1977-1978. Two captures were made in the barrel traps. Both otter were  juveniles which had previously been trapped in Hancock traps.  Advantages: Barrel traps can be set at any time of the year, under any  conditions.  Disadvantages: Traps are heavy and bulky. Most otter, especially older  animals, are reluctant to enter them. The barrels proved to be far more  effective on mink.  Hancock Trap  The Hancock 1ivetrap, originally designed for beaver (Castor fiber), is  perhaps the most effective trap for capturing river otter. Since June 1977,  Hancock 1ivetraps have been the primary capture device used on otter for  this study, with 21 captures resulting. Two adult-sized otter have been  captured, simultaneously, in one Hancock trap. On one occasion, three  juvenile otter weighing approximately 5 kg each were caught in one trap.  Several modifications are necessary to prevent the escape of otter from  Hancock live traps (Fig. 1). Northcott and Slade (1976) describe two of  these modifications, including the addition of a coil spring to the latches,  and either wire or rope woven along the sides of the basket. The addition  of a coil spring to each latch is not completely necessary if the trap is  set as shown, because gravity will keep the latches in a locked position.  When springs are not used, care must be taken to insure free movement of the  latches at all times.  We have made two additional modifications, designed to prevent small  3  otter escaping. Each wire junction along the top of the back side is welded.  The wire at the bottom of the back side is secured to an aluminum rod when  the trap is constructed. Because wire cannot be welded to aluminum, we  inserted a metal rod alongside of the aluminum rod and welded the wire to  it . Both of these modifications prevent an otter from spreading the wire  and escaping. On Vancouver Island an otter estimated to weigh about 12-13 kg,  escaped by forcing its way between points A and B (Fig. 1) as the unmodified  trap was lifted from the water. The placement of a metal rod welded to the  wire, not only prevents wire spreading, but also adds support that might have  prevented the otter from escaping. Finally, the traps are painted a flat  brown to cover up the aluminum.  Advantages : Hancock traps may be set either entirely on land or with  the basket side under water in places where otter climb out on land . Small,  non-target animals are generally too light to spring the traps. When cap­tured,  they can usually be released unharmed. When traps are properly  modified and set, escapes are fairly uncommon. Otter can be conveniently  drugged in the trap.  Oi sadvantages: Si ze and wei ght 1 imit the p1 aces where .these traps may  be set. They are largely inoperable during winter and other periods when  frozen ground and snow cover prevail . Beaver may become a nuisance by fre­quently  getting caught in the traps; we have caught 32 beaver in Hancock  traps. On several occasions, beaver were in the traps when otter arrived  at the site, thus precluding their capture. Otter may be injured if they are  caught between the sides of the closing trap. J S~ll &lt;pd"", .'de' to latch  Each wire junction is welded along  the top of the back side.  At least 3 loops of  wire are secured along ~-~~Jj~'ttpv  both sides of the basket.-  Figure 1. Modifications made to Hancock 1ivetraps.  A 3-5 mm diameter metal rod  is welded to each wire  across the bottom of the  back side.  Point A  Point B  I  Floating Trap  This trap may have great potential at fish hatcheries and areas where  fish traps are operating. Fish depredation by otter at these facilities  can create a major problem. In British Columbia, a floating trap was  effectively used at a fish trapping facility to catch and remove problem  otter (Stenson, pers. comm.).  The exact dimensions of this trap may vary, but the one which we con­structed  is 122 cm x 91 cm x 91 cm (Fig. 2). The frame was built of wood  and aluminum to keep it light. Covered with chain-link fence material, the  upper third of the trap front, where the animal enters, is left open. If  small live fish are used for bait, chicken wire should be attached below the  water line to prevent escape. The tri gger mechanism includes a hinged frame  in which chicken wire is loosely attached . The chicken wire has to be loosely  attached . The chicken wire has to be loose enough to ensure that the otter  is completely inside before the trap springs. A small rope attached to  each corner of the hinged trigger frame extends up to pulleys on each side  and continues toward the middle of the trap , where it then leads to the door.  At the end of the rope a cotter pin passes through a hole in the frame and  holds the plywood door open. The trap springs when an otter pushes down on  either the hinged trigger frame or wire mesh, thus pulling the cotter pin  from under the door.

Floating trap designed for river otter.  5  -- ---- -------  Floats are placed around the trap, allowing slight submersion of the  bottom of the entrance and trigger. Trapped animals may rest on a plat­form  attached to the back of the trap, above the water line.  Advantages: This trap may be used in areas where conditions do not  permit use of other traps -- frequently fluctuating water levels, rocky  shorelines, and freezing conditions that still permit areas of open water.  Disadvantages: Perhaps the greatest disadvantage is trap size. It  would be difficult to transport this trap to areas inaccessible by vehicle.  Additionally, live fish must be available as bait.  CARE AND HANDLING  Proper handling of otter is just as important as are effective capture  techniques. Minimizing the stress experienced during capture and avoiding  additional trauma and stress are important.  Drugging  Animals caught in leg-hold traps and Hancock 1ivetraps are drugged with  an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride at the capture site,  placed in a transfer cage, and delivered to the holding pen. At the  holding pen, they are provided a dark, quiet place for recovery. External  stimuli should be minimized during recovery (also see Bigler and Hoff 1974;  Ramsden et a1. 1976). Animals captured in barrel, Tomahawk, and culvert  traps are transferred in the trap to the holding pen without drugging.  We used ketamine hydrochloride as a drugging agent because it is easily  administered by syringe, takes effect rapidly, and has a wide margin of  safety. Ramsden et a1. (1976) listed some of the advantages of this agent,  including the fact that its effects are not cumulative as in barbiturates,  so doses can frequently be repeated.  We administer the drug to otter, marten (Martes americana), mink, and  beaver at a level of 22 mg/kg (10 mg/lb). Ramsden et al. (1976) describe  different dosages for simple immobilization and a surgical plane of anesthesia.  We have found the above dosage convenient when the animal is to be measured,  tagged, weighed, and inspected, as well as when surgery is to be performed.  Handling  Our holding pen consists of an indoor section (2.2 m x 1.42 m x 2.0 m)  connected by a 20 cm diameter culvert to an outdoor section (2.8 m x 2.0 m x  1.5 m). Animals may be allowed total use of the pen or confined to one section  or the other by closing doors at either end of the culvert. This flexibility  allows separate retention of animals if desired.  The 97 cm x 41 cm drugging box also serves as a nest box. The back,  one side, bottom, and front are composed of wood (Fig. 3). The entrance,  6 I  Figure 3. Drugging .box for river otter.  at the front, has a sliding door. One side and the top are made of chain­link  fence material. Also covering the top is a hinged plywood door that  allows inspection of the contained animal. One side is wire so that the  animal can be drugged when board A (Fig. 3) is pulled away from the box, thus  compressing the animal against the wire and board B.  Otter have been held in these facilities for up to 65 days without any  problems. Food, consisting mostly of fish, and water are provided to the  animals daily. All otter kept for any length of time gained weight and  looked healthy. Stenson (pers. comm.) has fed captive otter only fish and  a vitamin supplement for well over a year without any apparent complications.  Captured otter scheduled to receive a ratio implant will usually be held for  a minimum of 14 days.  When first released into the holding pen, otter are very frightened and  seek shelter in a dark place. They usually do not eat during the first day  in captivity. Each day they appear to become more and more accustomed to  the surroundings. Otter, depending on the indiv idual, will often take food  from your hand and be active in your presence within just a few days. Too  much contact with an animal could be detrimental , causing it to lose its fear  of man and become more vulnerable when released .  7  l  TELEMETRY  Radiotelemetry has allowed researchers an opportunity to collect data  once impossible to obtain. For some time, radiotelemetry was limited to  species with physical and behavioral features compatible to the present ""state  of the art"". As package size decreased and range increased, telemetry became  a feasible research tool for a greater number of species. Perhaps the most  recent group of animals in which the use of telemetry became practical were  those such as the otter, which are aquatic, semi-aquatic, or had physical  features prohibiting the use of external transmitter packages.  Collars  We began using external collars in 1976 . From September 1976 until  November 1977 , 15 otter were instrumented. Collars were placed on juvenile,  subadult, and adult males and females. The neck circumference of juveniles  i s smaller than the head, permitting the use of collars with moderate success.  Subadults and adults have larger necks and thus present a problem. Several  different collar designs were tested, including (in order) solid, expandable,  and solid-lined-with velcro for adults and expandable-with-velcro for juveniles.  Solid, smooth collars were kept on juveniles for more than 100 days  before being slipped off. Although placed tightly on adults, smooth collars  were readily removed by the animal. Smooth, expandable collars were slipped  within a short period of time . Expandable collars incorporating velcro were  retained with moderate success, but caused irritation. Solid collars lined  with velcro were retained but caused neck irritation.  All of the otter appeared to accept the radio collar, although they  frequently rubbed it against other objects. When an instrumented otter was  part of a social group, unmarked members occasionally investigated the  collar, but not excessively.  Implants  Based on the continuous problems experienced with collars (either  irritating the otter, slipping off, poor range, and lor radio failure), we  decided to investigate the possibilities of implantable radio transmitters.  Most of the work with radio implants involved small packages designed to  collect physiological data on penned animals. Both subcutaneous and intra­peritoneal  implants had been successfully tested on other species. For otter,  a subcutaneous implant was out of the question. We needed a package strong  enough to give good range with a minimum life of 1 year. A transmitter ful­filling  these requirements would be much too large to implant under the skin.  Smith and Whitney (1977) suggested the feasibility of intraperitoneal trans­mitter  implants for semi-aquatic mammals such as muskrat, beaver and otter.  Our first intraperitoneal implant was performed on a juvenile male  otter on 17 December 1977 by Dr. G. Dale Smith, D.V.M. During 1978, radios  8  ,  r  were implanted in nine additional otter. Initially, the incision was made  ventrally, along the linea alba. Otter frequently rub and slide on their  ventral surface. In two otter, we felt this rubbing, combined with the  transmitter lying against the incision, caused breakage of the sutures . Con­sequently,  we have made lateral incisions on the last five otter.  Nine of the· ten transmitters implanted thus far weighed approximately  130 g each. They are somewhat cylindrical in shape with a length of 10.5 cm  and a diameter of 4.1 cm. Estimated life of these implants is 12-14 months.  Our best ground-to-ground range has been approximately 3.5 km. Range varies  depending on the animal's activity and location, and is greatly increased  from an airplane.  Recently a smaller implant, weighing 65 g with a length of 6.5 cm and  a diameter of 2.8 cm, was surgica11y ·imp1anted in an otter . The estimated  life of this transmitter is 17 months. Preliminary testing indicates that  the range of the smaller transmitter is less than that of the larger ones.  However, considering that it is less expensive, smaller, and has a longer  life expectancy, its performance appears acceptable . Smaller transmitter  implants are preferred for females likely will become pregnant .  The weights of otter implanted ranged from 4.08 kg to 8. 62 kg. Trans­mitter  weights ranged from 1.3% to 3.2% of the animal's weight. The smallest  otter implanted was shot by a hunter 68 days after surgery . An inspection of  the intraperitoneal cavity revealed no abnormalities or rejection of the  implant. Our observations indicate that the wax-coated radio implants are  biocompatib1e and do not inhibit otter in any way.  IMPLANT PROCEDURES  Based upon previous experience, we feel the following procedures should  be employed in (1) preparing the transmitter for implant, (2) preparing the  animal for surgery, (3) the actual surgery, and (4) post-operative care of  the animal.  1. The animal is not fed for at least 12 hours prior to surgery.  2. Approximately 1 hour prior to surgery, the transmitter is washed  in surgical soap and placed in benzalkonium chloride for sterili­zation.  3. The animal is drugged with an intramuscular injection of ketamine  hydrochloride (10 mg/1b or 22 mg/kg).  4. A portion of the skin is then shaved clean where the incision  will be made. Enough area should be shaved to provide approxi­mately  1.0 cm of bare skin on all sides of the incision. The  actual incision site is on a dorso-ventra1 axis, anterior to the  9 OF IDAHO UBRARY  hind leg, posterior to the ribs, and slightly below the dorsal  surface of the animal.  5. The animal is then transferred to the operating table where  the incision site is washed with organic iodine. After placing  a drape over the animal, it is ready for surgery.  6. Using a scalpel, an incision is made through the skin, just large  enough to allow insertion of the radio. The underlying muscles  are torn open, rather than cut, by separating the muscle fibers  along the main axis of each muscle layer. Care must be taken not  to injure a kidney, the diaphragm, or other internal organs.  NOTE: Surgery is performed under as steri1 conditions as possi ­ble  in an effort to reduce the possibility of infection.  7. The radio is then inserted into the intraperitoneal cavity and  allowed to ""float free"".  8. Each tissue layer is sutured using biodegradable gut suture  material. Monofilament teflon suture material for strength  is used for final suturing of the skin.  9. After the operation, the animal is given an injection of anti­biotics  and then placed in a quiet, dark area for recovery.  10. The animal is given water, but not fed for at least 12 hours  after surgery.  11. To minimize the possibility of a rupture due to excessive move­ment,  the animal is confined in a small holding pen (approxi­mately  100 cm x 45 cm x 30 cm) for about 7 days, especially at  night. This time period may vary, depending on how active the  animal is and how well the incision heals .  12. After about 7 days, the an imal is drugged, weighed, and thoroughly  inspected. If normal heal i ng is apparent and there is no sign  of a rupture (bulging appearance) , the animal is then released  into a large pen . The animal is allowed free movement within  the large pen for an addit ional 2 or more days, after which  time it is observed for possible rupturing of the muscle or  tearing of the skin. If neither has occurred , and the animal  appears healthy and is feeding properly, it is then released.  The sutures in the skin may be removed prior to releasing the  animal, but this is not necessary.  10  •  POPULATION STRUCTURE  Otter populations are composed of breeding adults, nonbreeding adults,  subadu1ts, and juveniles (Table 1). Depending on the time of year, anyone  of these individuals may be found alone, or in association. To facilitate  interpretation of otter sign, we listed possible group compositions for  different period·s of the year. To accommodate the wide variety of climates  in which river otter are found, we then divided the year into breeding and  nonbreeding periods. The breeding period extends from the time when an  adult female comes into estrus, until she first leaves the natal den with  her pups. The nonbreeding period would be the remainder of the year.  With the exception of the Class A association, all other classes may  occur during the nonbreeding period. The presence of Class H through N  associations (except Classes K and L) generally would not occur until approxi­mately  3 months after the pups are weaned. Family groups may start to break  up at this time. Although we have observed Class K and N associations, they  are probably uncommon.  Adult male otter tend to be solitary, except during the breeding season  when they accompany estrus females. On one occasion, during the fall, we  observed what was believed to have been an adult male otter with a female  and her two pups. He was only seen with this family group on this one  occasion. Nonbreeding adults and subadu1ts of either sex (Classes D, E, F,  G, and L) may also be present in the area during the breeding period.  CENSUS TECHNIQUES  Numerous techniques have been developed for censusing a variety of  animals (Fitzner et a1. 1977). Considering a certain margin of error, these  techniques may provide data on population trends, relative abundance, density,  species diversity, biomass estimates, movements, and perhaps more. Because  of their habits, reliable census techniques for certain species, including  river otter, are difficult to develop.  We have concluded that there is no simple method of censusing river  otter. The presence of otter in an area can easily be determined by search­ing  for tracks, scats, and other sign. Population estimates are obtained  through a combination of capture data, visual observations of unmarked  otter, tracks and other sign .  Capture Data  Captured otter are ear-tagged with small metal fingerling tags. Co10r­coded  tags could be used to identify individuals in the field, especially  when radio-telemetry techniques are not employed. These tags are readily  5eenthrough binoculars and enable the observer to distinguish betwe~n marked  and unmarked animals.  11  /  Table 1.

Visual Observations  Although otter may be active at any time during the day or night, visual  sightings are most often made during crepuscular hours. Otter often spend  a great deal of time in areas where food is seasonally abundant or concen­trated  (e.g., spawning grounds). These areas are ideal for making visual  observations. Sightings of unmarked otter in areas where marked animals  occur provide additional information about the otter population in a given  area. Unfortunately, because visual sightings of otter may be few and far  between, they alone would not be reliable for determining population density.  Tracks, Scats, and Other Sign  Areas where otter emerge from the water are called ""pull i ng out"" p1 aces  (Liers 1951) or ""landings"". In addition to footprints, Grinnell et a1.  (1937) describe at least four other important kinds of sign that may be left  by otter. These include slides, rolling places, sign heaps, and droppings  (feces or scats). With the exception of slides, these sign types may be  found at otter landings.  The presence of otter slides is most likely exaggerated. We have yet  to see a place where otter have repeatedly slid, either through the snow or  in the mud. This does not mean that otter do not slide. By alternately  loping and sliding through the snow, otter are able to rapidly cover great  distances. In 1976. we observed where a family group had slid continuously  through the snow for about 300 m down the side of a mountain .  Rolling places usually occur in grassy or sandy areas along stream banks  and prominent points of land along ponds. lakes, and other large bodies of  water. Vegetation at grassy sites may be conspicuously matted down for 1-3 m  across . Rolling places occur where otter dry off, groom, rub themselves, or  indulge in social interactions such as care-giving behavior. At these  sites, otter may build sign heaps by twisting the grass or scraping it into  small mounds where scent is then deposited from their anal glands. In addi­tion,  otter will often defecate at rolling places before departing from the  area.  Otter frequently defecate on logs that project out into the water, on  logjams, sandbars, rocks, or any object that sticks out of the water. In  the winter, sign may be covered by frequent snowfalls. Furthermore, otter  will occasionally tunnel into the snow and defecate, making discovery diffi­cult.  Because of the snow cover, most traditional landings are not used in  the winter.  The number of scats in a specific area is not always a good indication  of how many otter are present. A single otter may defecate several times  in one place in a matter of hours. We followed the tracks of two otter  traveling upstream on Lake Fork Creek just after a snowfall in April 1977.  These two otter defecated at least eight times in a 2.4 km distance.  13  Presence of tracks can provide useful information when attempting to  determine the population density and composition of otter in a selected area.  Preferably, there should be sandbars, mudflats, and areas of exposed soil  where traoks would be visible. The value of this information depends on how  well tracks show up in the substrate. Areas where the substrate is dominated  by rocks and gravel would reveal few tracks. Winter surveys, when snow  covers the ground, would be more desirable in these areas.  The absence of tracks in an area searched may not necessarily indicate  that it is not occupied by otter. We have often failed to find fresh si gn  in consistently used areas even when our instrumented otter are in the  vicinity . Conversely, one otter can leave an abundance of tracks and other  sign when occupying a small area .  In west-central Idaho, tracks indicate that juvenile otter probably  start traveling with the female in late June. At this time, it is easy to  distinguish the tracks of juveniles from older otter . This becomes pro­gressively  difficult as the pups continue to grow. By October, tracks of  juvenile otter are nearly the same size as those of older animals; delineating  one from the other with any degree of confidence is almost impossible.  RECOMMENDATIONS  The following suggestions are offered to biologists who are faced with  the task of censusing an area for otter.  Otter often travel to mountain lakes, up feeder creeks, to ponds and  reservoirs, or concentrate in a small section of their home range. Con­sequently,  they may be absent from a substantial portion of their range for  extensive periods. Because of this, as much of the area in question as  possible should be checked for sign . This is especially important when  searching for fresh activity. If this is not feasible, selected sites  should be periodically checked in an effort to detect otter that move into,  or through, these areas.  Otter population densities vary throughout the country . Prey abundance,  weather conditions, human activities, competitive interactions, and den site  availability influence the total number of otter inhabiting a specific ar·ea.  Population structure, as well as density, probably will vary in areas where  otter trapping is permitted . Based on our studies of approximately 60  straightline kilometers of rivers and lakes (12% lakes) in west-central Idaho,  the following data may be used as a general basis for estimating the density  and structure of otter populations. These figures were arrived at by divid­ing  the total estimated population into the size of the study area.  We estimate there is approximately one otter for every 2-3 km of water­way  . This is straightline distance; the actual distance in a meandering  straightline distance; the actual distance in a meandering stream might be  14  1,  a great deal more. Tributaries are not included in this measurement, although  they may be part of the animals' range.  Based on social structure, there would be one family group (adult  female plus two or three pups) and one to three subadu1ts and/or nonbreeding  adults for every 15 km of waterway. In addition, at least one breeding  adult male would occupy approximately 20-30 km. This does not mean that  only one family group would occupy a specific 15 km of waterway. We have  found more than one family group plus subadu1t otter occupying an area where  salmon were spawning. Simultaneously, otter were absent from large sections  of the study area.  CONCLUSIONS  Research techniques for river otter have only recently been developed.  Technical advancement in radiotelemetry and an increased interest in the  species have made it feasible to conduct field research on certain aspects  of otter ecology that were once not possible. As a result, several research  projects on river otter have recently been initiated. The need for reliable  research techniques has thus become apparent in an effort to reduce time and  cost of such projects. As we progress in our knowledge of the otter, these  techniques will no doubt be modified and new ones added,  15  J  LITERATURE CITED  Bigler, W. J., and G. L. Hoff. 1974.

Contribution No. 194  Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station  University of Idaho  JUNE 1980  ABSTRACT  Despite their unconventional image geometr'io, panoramic high-altitude air photographs  clearly depict forest roads and trails which may not appear on other resource photography  and maps. A conventional image-transfer device, the Bausch & Lomb Zoom Transfer Scope,  was able to compensate for panoramic distortion sufficiently that these secondary routes  could be transferred from the photographs to base maps. A modification to allow use of  roll film is described.  (  IDAHO 1 AllY  •  INTRODUCTION  Over the past five years, high-resolution medium-scale panoramic aerial photography has  been increasingly available to resource managers through the U.S. Forest Service's Houston-based  Nationwide Forestry Applications Program. The photography is obtained by two now-declassified  items of military intelligence gear, the Itek KA-80A Optical Bar Panoramic Camera  and the Lockheed U-2 aircraft, from altitudes of about 60,000 feet above ground level. The  U-2 aircraft employed in resource photography missions are operated by the National Aero-nautics  and Space Administration's Airborne Instrumentation Research Project.  Optical bar panoramic photography is best described as very high-quality, relatively  inexpensive, medium-scale transparency imagery, which can be obtained quickly over large  areas, but which confronts the user with unconventional photo geometry and presents certain  handling and viewing problems. The authors elsewhere (1980) describe methods of over-coming  the handling and viewing difficulties without recourse to expensive specialized equip-ment.  The geometrical idiosyncrasies of panoramic photography give trouble chiefly in  measurement of ground areas and in transfer of detail from photographs to base maps. For  measurement of area, users may order transparent equal-area overlay grids from the Forest  Service's photogrammetry office in Washington,1 specifying aircraft altitude, average terrain  elevation, and grid cell size. These overlays match the geometry of optical bar photography  and are inexpensive and reusable.  For transfer of detail, the authors have found that a standard Bausch & Lomb Zoom  Transfer Scope,&gt; a widely available device used in many resource management offices where  air photography is employed, is capable of adequately compensating for the geometric dis-tortion  of panoramic photography over the most important portion of each frame. If flight  lines are not more than 20 miles apart-a standard specification for U-2/KA-80A missions-detail  can be accurately transferred to all of the area covered in a photo mission, excepting  only the outermost flanks of coverage.  1 Photogrammetry, Engineering Staff, National Forest Stystem, Forest Service- USDA, P.

PHOTO GEOMETRY  The optical bar panoramic camera scans a 120-degree transverse swath as the aircraft  proceeds along its flight path_ If the aircraft is 60,000 feet above ground, the area scanned is  almost 40 miles across. In the direction of flight, the camera's angular field of view is only 11  degrees; this subtends 2.2 miles directly beneath the aircraft, and twice that at the extreme  ends of scan. Figure 1 schematically illustrates how the ""bow tie""-shaped ground scan pattern  is turned into a rectangular photograph with a characteristic type of distortion, termed  ::~~:;:'.:::::~"" 1!tI-+1-1---+--+I-+! 1111  \  \  \  \  \  Curved f11m  platen: film moves  1n opposite direction  from scan  ~tmk of airc raft  /  ._---_''::.;-;-:-..

Panoramic photography is taken by a camera having a rotating lens assembly and a  semicylindrical.film platen. The rotating lens scans at right angles to the direction of flight;  its ground field of view in the direction of flight is broader at the extreme ends of the scan  than directly below the aircraft. This eccentrically shaped ground scan pattern is projected  onto the film platen, and thus optically ""compressed"" into a rectangular photograph.  Panoramic distortion, with convergence and foreshortening, is the result.  2  t  panoramic distortion. In the particular case of the KA-80A, the photograph is 50 inches wide  (in the direction of scan) and 5 inches long (in the direction of flight) . Successive photographs  appear side by side in the reel of film. Scale directly beneath the aircraft is 1 :30,000.  Panoramic distortion is an unavoidable feature of panoramic photography. Another type  of distortion, called scan positional distortion, arises whenever a camera of this type makes  photographs from a moving vehicle, since the scanning operation must take a certain length of  time, during which the vehicle alters its position. Fortunately, this type of distortion can be  reduced to practically negligible proportions by ""forward motion compensation"" mechanisms.  In the KA-80A, the rotating lens head ""nods"" slightly to compensate for forward movement.  The nodding action itself adds a third element of distortion to the photography, but this is  of significance only in precision photogrammetry.  Panoramic distortion affects the scale of objects depicted in a photograph. As Figure 2  illustrates, it acts in two different directions at two different- but related-rates. These rates  are functions of the transverse scan angle at which an object is photographed. The scale of an  object measured in the ""in-track"" direction (parallel to the track of the aircraft, i.e., across the  short dimension of the photograph) varies with the cosine of the scan angle, as measured from  the vertical. The scale of objects measured in the ""cross-track"" direction (across the track of  the aircraft, parallel to the direction of scan) varies with the square of the same cosine. Thus,  except along the ""nadir line"" directly beneath the aircraft, the depicted scale of any object's  cross-track dimension will always be smaller than that of its in-track dimension, which itself  will vary with the angle at which it was photographed. An image-transfer device must be able  to correct for this dual distortion ifit is to be usable with panoramic imagery.  TRACING FOREST ROADS AND TRAILS  Optical bar panoramic transparencies have excellent color rendit ion and high resolu ­tion-  on the order of 25 line pairs per millim eter of f ilm , which means that objects two feet  wide may be dist inguished from one anoth er at the nominal nad ir scale of 1 :30,000. Linear  3  a  p n  N  G  A \  \  \  Figure 2. In general, the scale of a vertical aerial photograph is fixed by the ratio between two  distances: the distance {focal length) from lens L to the film platen, and the distance from a  photographed object on the ground G to the lens. Directly beneath the aircraft, the scale is  thus n/N with any camera. When a conventional camera with flat platen F is used, displace­ment  of the photographed object from the center of the picture makes no difference to its  depicted scale, since the ratio a/A, by the principle of similar triangles, always equals nINo In a  panoramic camera, with an arc-5haped film platen P, distance ""a"" remains constant and equal  to n, while A increases as the inverse of the cosine of view angle 8. Thus scale equals n/N only  beneath the aircraft; elsewhere it is equal to n/{N/cos e). A further complication arises: this  relationship holds true only for measurements made ""in-track,"" parallel to the direction of  flight. For ""cross-track"" measurements made in the direction of scan, image foreshortening  must be taken into account as well; the camera records not line B, but line ""b""-which is  related to B by the cosine of e. So for cross-track measurements, scale is n/{N/cos' e).  objects may be distinguished with even greater acuity: on some frames, the authors were  able to pick out high-voltage power lines near the limit of scan, where effective image scale was  about 1 :85,000. Users of optical bar photography have found that it lends itself well to the  tracing of roads and trails that do not appear on other resource photographs or maps (Bowlin  1979, Bluestein 19803  ).  3 Personal communication.  4  The bright, raw scars of recently constructed logging roads are easily followed with the  naked eye on panoramic transparencies. Other secondary routes are often more difficult to  detect, being masked by vegetation to some extent on account of their age or their small size.  Where they pass through heavy timber, old logging roads and hiking or horseback trails may  be detectable only as occasional linear openings in the tree cover. Interpreters attempting to  trace these difficult routes usually begin where the tracks cross watercourses or open areas,  and work back from these to reconstruct the more problematical sections.  Stereoscopic viewing is an important aid in tracing travel routes, although the job may  be done monoscopically if proper stereo equipment is not available. Optical bar photography  has the conventional 50-60 percent overlap, and the entire mission area may be viewed stereo­scopically.  If the user has access to a split light table with take-up rollers to reduce image.  separation, and a stereoscope with rotatable optics to align his eyes with the flight line, stereo  interpretation may be performed without cutting individual transparencies from the roll of  film. Where such equipment is not available, pairs of individual exposures may be fastened to  a long light table, their 50-inch sides parallel and close together, and viewed with a pocket  stereoscope, mirror stereoscope, or scanning stereoscope.  Probably the best way to trace secondary routes is to view the photographs stereo­scopically,  marking the routes on overlay material, and then to transfer the marked routes  from the overlaid photos to a map. If the user wishes to keep the film in roll form , temporary  overlays with reference marks for later re-registration may be taped in place during interpre­tation.  Users who must separate their transparencies will probably find it most satisfactory to  laminate them between sheets of clear plastic (Befort, Heller, and Ulliman 1980). This greatly  increases the durability of the photography and provides a permanent, reusable annotation  surface.  In delineating aerial photographic detail , it is customary to demarcate an ""effective  area"" on every photograph, or on every second photograph, in order to eliminate duplicate  delineation and to ensure that the best available exposures, out of all those which might  5  cover a given point, are used for its interpretation. The curvilinearity which results from  panoramic distortion makes it difficult and laborious to rule in accurate effective areas on  optical bar photography, and the photographs' unconventional size and shape complicate  matters. For purposes of route tracing, the economical solution is probably to confine annota­tion  to every second exposure, using one of the index tick-marks in the margin of the film as a  sidelap boundary and accepting the possibility of a certain amount of duplication.  It was noted earlier that the ground scan pattern of the optical bar camera, assuming an  altitude of 60,000 feet above terrain, is about 40 miles wide. It will be apparent that not all  portions of the resulting photograph are equally useful : at the extreme edge of scan, in-track  scale is 1 :60,000 and cross-track scale is 1 :120,000, and the view afforded is quite oblique,  being only 30 degrees below horizontal. The usual practice, therefore, is to space panoramic  flight lines from 17 to 20 miles apart, rather than 30-40 miles apart. With a 20-mile flight line  separation, the interpreter can confine his attention to the central 35 inches of the 30-inch  exposure, and need never accommodate himself to a viewing angle more than 41 degrees from  the vertical; in-track scale is never smaller than 1 :40,000, and the lower limit of cross-track  scale is 1 :53,000.  TRANSFER TO BASE MAPS  Image transfer devices allow the interpreter to see two images-a photograph and a map,  ordinarily-at once, and provide some means of bringing the images into congruence by adjust­ment  of scale and geometry. The interpreter fits the two images together and is then able to  draw the photographic detail onto the map in something like its correct position. The ability  to adjust geometry as well as scale is important in aerial photo work, since most airphotos  are affected by topographic displacement-the distortion which arises in viewing irregular  objects from a central perspective-and may also exhibit the adverse geometric effects of air­craft  tip and tilt. Panoramic photographs combine these common geometric problems with  their own peculiar panoramic distortion effects.  6  7  The Bausch & Lomb Zoom Transfer Scope (Fig. 3) is a desktop transfer instrument  which costs about $6,000 and is in wide use for map revision. In the standard monoscopic  model, a photograph is clipped to a vertical stage facing the operator, where it can be illu­minated  from behind if a transparency or from in front if a print. The map to be revised is  placed on the table beneath the instrument, where it also is illuminated. The operator views  map and photograph simultaneously, through a split optical train. He may change the magni­fication  at which he views the map by installing ""map lenses"" of various powers. He has  considerably more freedom as regards his view of the photograph: he may enlarge it up to  14 times, rotate it through 360 degrees, and optically ""stretch"" it in any direction he chooses  without changing its other dimensions. By controlling, with rheostat switches, the amount of  light falling on map and photograph, he can balance the strength of the two parts of the com­bined  image, or flash rapidly from one to the other.  It is the ""stretch"" feature of the ZTS which adapts it well to panoramic photo­graphy,  and makes it possible to correct for panoramic distortion. The operator, viewing a  portion of a photograph and the corresponding section of a map, uses the enlargement control  to adjust for the in-track component of photo distortion, and then stretches the photo image  in the direction of scan to remove the cross-track component. Successive portions of the  photograph are so registered and their detail transferred until the entire effective area has been  transcribed. Because panoramic distortion proceeds at an increasing rate with scan angle, the  size of the portion of photograph in which the operator is able to compensate effectively for  panoramic distortion shrinks with distance from the nadir line. Topographic displacement also  increases with distance from the flight line. In mountainous terrain, these two factors combine  to put a practical limit to image transfer at about 10 lateral miles from the flight line, or about  40 degrees of panoramic scan as measured from the vertical. Fortunately, as we have noted,  the conventional spacing of U-2/KA-80A flight lines permits achievement of full coverage  within this limitation; only the imagery beyond 10 miles from the outermost flight lines of a  photo project cannot be conveniently transcribed.  Figure 3. Zoom Transfer Scope (ZTS), modified to accept roll film. Film roll brackets slide  onto plates attached to top and bottom of vertical photo stage; undercut rails on Plexiglas  sheet in front of stage hold film flat. The metal ""wings"" on the stage are an earlier modifica­tion,  unrelated to panoramic photography.  MOSCOW MOUNTAIN ROAD MAPPING PROJECT  Using an available ZTS and 10 color infrared photographs from a 1979 U-2/KA-80A  flight (No. 79-087, 3 July), the principal author revised the secondary road network depicted  on three 7Y:z-minute map quadrangles: Stanford, Moscow Mountain, and Robinson Lake  (Idaho). Orthophotoquads were employed as base maps; they allowed, because of their photo-graphic  detail, much more precise registration of photograph and map than would have been  possible with standard topographic quadrangles. The base maps' secondary road nets had  8  originally been mapped by the U.s. Geological Survey and had been photorevised and  amplified by the University of Idaho's Cart-O-Graphics Laboratory during production of a  complete set of map separations for Latah County, Idaho. Despite this recent updating, and in  spite of the fact that all road interpretation was done monoscopically on the ZTS itself, rather  than in a separate stereoscopic analysis, panoramic photo interpretation added 120 percent to  the total length of secondary roads on the base maps. Mileage on the Moscow Mountain sheet  was increased from 91 to 201. Some previously mapped roads were eliminated.  Accuracy of route tracing and classification in this exercise probably suffered from lack  of stereoscopic inspection ; however, the rate of production of revised maps probably benefited.  After experience was gained, an operator was able to revise a 7Y,-minute quadrangle in less  than three days' time, despite the high density of previously unmapped road. New secondary  road separations were scribed for each quad; this took about the same length of time as  revision itself. Transparent Ozalid masters were then constructed by Cart-O-Graphics personnel.  The revised orthophotoquads will be field-checked in summer 1980 by University of Idaho  Experimental Forest crews, for whom they will serve as working tools in forest management.  In operating the ZTS with panoramic film, it was found that a map-scale enlargement  of two diameters gave the most generally satisfactory results. The 2·power map lens has a  circular field of view about 4.3 inches in diameter on the map, which is large enough for  orientation and small enough that an adequate distortion adjustment can be obtained over  most of the visible area. However, delineation is best confined to the central 2 or 2Y,·inch  portion of the field of view. Near the nadir line, the 1-power map lens with its broader (7.4-  inch diameter) field of view on the map may be brought into play, since panoramic distortion  is at a minimum here; with this lens, interpretation should be confined to the central 4 or 5  inches of the field of view, and the instrument readjusted when it is necessary to move beyond  this circle. At the edge of the effective area, 10 miles from the flight line (about 17 inches  from the center of the photograph). nearly two-thirds of the available 2X stretch adjustment  is needed to compensate for cross·track distortion and topographic displacement. Here some  . IDAHO  9  10  experimentation with direction of stretch may be needed before a satisfactory accommodation  can be reached.  The vertical photo stage of the ITS was placed in its rearward position, and the .S-power  attachment lens was used. Photo enlargement adjustments ranged from 1.2SX at the nadir  with the 1-power map lens in place, to 3X at the edge of the effective area with the 2-power  map lens in use. At any position on the photograph, the ""zoom"" feature of the ITS served as  an important interpretation aid, enabling the operator to take a close look at a doubtful road  or trail without disturbing his other settings.  ROLL-FILM MODIFICATION  Minor alterations were made to allow optical bar film to be used in roll form on the ITS,  as illustrated in Figure 3. Two pairs of film roll brackets were taken from a light table, and  mounting plates were made from mild steel to fit them. These plates were bolted to the top  and bottom of the vertical photo stage. Rectangles of quarter-inch Plexiglas went between the  plates and the stage as spacers. The bottom plate had to be short enough to allow mounting  and dismounting of the roll brackets.  The sheet of eighth-inch Plexiglas in front of the vertical stage was replaced by another,  which had undercut plastic rails glued to it to serve as film guides. The top and bottom edges  of this sheet were carefully rounded and sanded to avoid scratching the film. Most optical bar  photography comes to the user in the form of duplicate transparencies which read correctly  from the emulsion side; the film emulsion faces away from the stage and is in no danger of  being damaged by friction. Where it is found desirable to keep optical bar photography in roll  form, this arrangement will allow satisfactory use of the transfer instrument.  LITERATURE CITED  Befort, W.A., R.C.

Therefore, this study was developed to  establish the distribution of stalactiform blister rust in Idaho lodge­pole  pine forests and the environmental conditions in which this rust  disease can occur.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Locations in Idaho of lodgepole pine infected with stalactiform  blister rust were obtained from survey procedures developed by the Forest  Pathology Unit, College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences at  the University of Idaho (4, 8) and through responses to a request of  ranger district personnel of the United States Forest Service.  The survey records provided locations of plots containing lodgepole  pine. Each plot record indicated the presence or absence of stalactiform  blister rust, notations regarding other disease and insect problems,  elevation, habitat type, position on slope, percent slope, and aspect.  Habitat classifications used for the Clearwater and Idaho  Panhandle National Forests were those of Daubenmire and Daubenmire (2).  The classifications used for the following areas were developed  by Steele, et a1, the Bitterroot and Nez Perce National Forests (9),  the Boise, Challis, Payette, Salmon, and the north half of the Sawtooth  National Forests (11), and the Caribou, south half of the Sawtooth, and  the Targhee National Forests (10).  The descriptions of positions on slopes followed the classes used  by Geils (4):  ""ridge,"" mountain summit and associated summit ridges;  ""upper,"" upper one-third of north and east slopes or upper two- thirds  of west and south slop""es;  2  ABSTRACT  Stalactiform blister rust, caused by Cronartium coleosporioides,  occurs on hard pines throughout North America. Locations of lodgepole  pine reported in disease surveys of Idaho forests, 1968-1980, showed  stalactiform blister rust to occur between 1500 m and 2438 m. Abies  lasiocarpa/Xerophyllum tenex and A. lasiocarpa/Vaccinium scoparium are  the most common habitat types supporting lodgepole pine and stalactiform  blister rust. The rust occurred independently of many disease and  insect problems found on lodgepole pine during the survey.  Additional Key Words: Peridermium stalactiforme, pine stem rust  INTRODUCTION  Stalactiform blister rust, caused by Cronartium coleosporioedes  Arth., is a disease of hard pines in North America causing cankers which  reduce volume and which cause some mortality in all age classes. The  distribution of lodgepole pine is from southeastern Alaska and the  interior Yukon Territory to northern Baja California and east to the  Black Hills of South Dakota (3). Stalactiform blister rust occurs in  much of the lodgepole pine areas and in the jack pine (Pinus banksiana  Lamb.) area of north central United States and Canada (1, 5, 7, 12).  The lodgepole pine host (Pinus contorta Dougl.) is divided into three  geographical varieties, eastward, P. ~ontorta var. latifolia Engelm.,  westward, shore pine, P. contorta var. contorta, and Cascades and Sierra  Nevada, P. contorta var. murrayana (Grev. & Balf.) Engelm. While the  host distribution and effects of this disease are generally known, there  1  ""middle,"" lower two-thirds of north and east slopes or lower one-third  of west and south slopes;  ""lower,"" gentle slopes adjacent to valley floors;  ""flat,"" dry benches with no dominant drainage direction; and  ""wet,"" stream bottom, meadows, or valley floors.  Aspect of the slope was sighted to the nearest ~ compass quadrant .  Slope was measured to the nearest 5 percent using a Spiegel Relascope .  Plots having no slope were recorded as having no aspect. Elevations  were measured with the aid of an altimeter calibrated in 25-foot intervals  and then converted to the metric equivalent.  In an attempt to enlarge the stalactiform blister rust survey  beyond the limits of our resources and time, a request to report  stalactiform blister rusted stands was sent to the supervisors of the  following national forests: Bitterroot, Boise, Caribou, Challis, Clearwater,  Nez Perce, Payette, Salmon, Sawtooth, Targhee, and the Idaho Panhandle  National Forests (Figure 1). Ranger district personnel recorded the  township, range, section, habitat type, and elevation of stalactiform  blister rusted stands in their areas.  RESULTS  The elevational occurrence of lodgepole pine sampled in 133 locations  ranged from 838 m (2750 ft) to 2560 m (8400 ft). Stalactiform blister  rust was found to occur in 64 of these locations between the elevations  of 1500 m (4925 tt) and 2438 m (8125 ft) (Tables I, 2, 3, and Figure 1).  Earlier survey records of the Forest Pathology Unit did not  specifically include stalactiform blister rust but instead inventoried  mechanical damage and scars not caused by fire (Table 2) .

Both of these habitat  types occur from mid to upper elevations, on various slopes and aspects,  and in them the frequency of lodgepole pine dominates the stand (9, 10,  11) . Nearly 40 percent of the plots containing lodgepole pine occurred  on these two habitat types, whereas the remaining 60 percent were  distributed over the 28 other habitat types.  Because of inadequate habitat type data in some records, only 45  of the 63 locations where rust was found were used to associate  stalactiform blister rust with habitat type (Table 4). Ninety-five  percent of the 45 locations containing lodgepole pine infected with  stalactiform blister rust were in the Abies lasiocarpa climax series  or Pinus contorta climax or community series. The remaining 5 percent  were in the Pseudotsuga menziesii . climax series. Pinus contorta is a  common seral species in both Abie s lasiocarpa and Pseudotsuga menziesii  climax series and may occupy the site through many generations of lodgepole  pine before giving way to the competitive ability of the climax species.  Pinus contorta may persist in compatible habitat types on gentle terrain  where cold air pockets exist and the water table fluctuates (9, 10, 11) .  At lower elevations, lodgepole pine dominates as a seral in the  Pseudotsuga menziesii climax series. At upper elevations, Abies  l asiocarpa was identified as the climax series through the understory  vegetation of the Pinus contorta community types (9, 10, 11) . Warm and  dry environmental conditions favor the Pseudotsuga menziesii climax  series, whereas cool and moist conditions favor Abies lasiocarpa climax  series. Mid-elevations are transition zones between the Pseudotsuga  10  menziesii and Abies lasiocarpa climax series. Throughout this study when  Pinus contorta community types were encountered and a climax species was  not present, the understory vegetations belonged to habitat types in the  Abies lasiocarpa climax series.

The frequencies of stalactiform blister  rust present in these habitat types were 31.8 percent and 25.0 percent  respectively, and together represented about 56 percent of those  containing stalactiform blister rust (Table 4).  The only habitat type in this study where lodgepole pine is the  climax species is Pinus contorta/Festuca idahoensis (Pico/Feid). This  habitat type occurs in broad valleys at upper elevations (9, 10, 11).  Two locations in the Boise National Forest representing the Pico/Feid  habitat type were sampled. At one location stalactiform blister rust was  present in lodgepole pine. The aspect of this location was northeast,  whereas the rust-free location was southeast. The elevation of both  locations was about 2000 m (6550 ft).  Pseudotsuga menziesii climax series were represented in 9 locations,  5 in the Boise National Forest, 3 in the Challis National Forest, and 1  in the Targhee National Forest (Tables 1, 2, 3). Of these nine  locations, only the location in the Targhee National Forest contained  stalactiform blister rust. The habitat types in the Pseudotsuga  menziesii climax series sampled were Arnica cordifolia (Psme/Arco),  Calamagrostis rubescens (Psme/Caru), Carex geyeri (Psme/Cage),  Symphoricarpos albus (Psme/Syal), and Juniperus communis (Psme/Juco).  Psme/Arco, Psme/Syal, and Psme/Juco occur at lower elevations where  environmental conditions are warm and dry (9, 10, 11). Lodgepole pine  dominates the Psme/Syal habitat type and may occur in Psme/Arco and  Psme/Juco habitat types (9, 10, 11). Psme/Cage occurs at mid to upper  elevations where the environmental conditions are cool and dry, but  lodgepole pine either is accidental or a minor seral species in some  12  stands (9, 10, 11) . Psme/Caru occurs at mid to upper elevations where  the environmental conditions are cool and dry (9, 10, 11), but in central  Idaho, lodgepole pine is a minor seral species in some stands (9, 11) and  in eastern Idaho, lodgepole pine can dominate the stand (10). The single  habitat type which contained stalactiform blister rust was in an eastern  Idaho stand where the habitat type was Psme/Caru and lodgepole pine dominated  the stand. The environmental conditions were similar to the conditions  found in Abla/Xete and Abla/Vasc habitat types.  The possible associations of stalactiform blister rust with other  disease and insect problems of lodgepole pine were tabulated for the  years 1969-1979 (Table 5). The most common problems found on lodgepole  pine, other than stalactiform blister rust, were western gall rust, caused  by Endocronartium harknessii Y. Hirutsuka, and dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium  ameri canum Nutt. Western gall rust and dwarf mistletoe appear to occur  independently of stalactiform blister rust in that they were found with  near equal frequency on both infected and rust-free lodgepole pine.

However, in 194 lodgepole pine trees  sampled in 116 locations, only one decay, caused by Dichomitus squalens  (Karst) Reid (=polyporus anceps Pk.), was found in one tree of  27 having stalactiform blister rust. Other stem decays were in lodgepole  pine without stalactiform blister rust (Table 5).  The University of Idaho survey records for 1969-1979 documented  mountain pine beetle on 1 of 194 lodgepole pines sampled. That tree was  listed as rust free (Table 5). In these records, rodent feeding on  14  diseased tissues was noted as prevalen~ but no further information was  given. In this study, we found no evidence of mountain pine beetle in  68 trees with stalactiform blister rust. Kulhavy et al. (6) reported  that mountain pine beetle can successfully attack the margins of  stalactiform blister rust cankers on lodgepole pine. He studied trees  in 16 stands in 2 central Idaho locations; however, he did not state the  number of trees sampled. Eleven of these stands were in the Payette  National Forest and 5 in the Nez Perce National Forest. Infected trees  or diseased tissues were suggested as excellent host trees for the  beetle.  DISCUSSION  The habitat types (9, 10, 11) in which stalactiform blister rust  was found to be common had the following characteristics: lodgepole  pine was the dominant tree species in the stands, the climates were cool  and dry, the stands occurred on mid to upper elevations (1500 m to 2438 m),  but the slopes and aspects were variable and nondescriptive (Tables 6,  7). Apparently, middle slope is related to the occurrence of stalactiform  blister rust (P 0.99, Table 8); however, we believe this to be bias due  to greater number of stands at mid-slope and feel that position on slope  is unrelated. Also, no relationship could be shown to percent slope and  aspect (P = 0.65 and P = 0.67, respectively).  The range of environmental characteristics of habitat types (9, 10,  11) indicates that stalactiform blister rust decreases as moisture  increases irrespective of temperature. Moreover, when temperature  increases, as it does in the range of Pseudotsuga menziesii habitat  types, specifically of the lower elevations of central Idaho, stalactiform  15  blister rust also diasppears. In other habitat types temperature was  also the limiting factor for stalactiform blister rust distribution.  Habitat types containing lodgepole pine that have warm (below 1500 m) or  cold to extremely cold (above 2440 m) temperatures do not support  stalactiform blister rust. Thus stalactiform rust is limited to a range  of approximately 1000 m, between 1500 m (4925 ft) and 2440 m (8125 ft)  in Idaho.  TABLE 6. Frequency of lodgepole pine vs. % slope.

At southern latitudes where average temperatures are warmer, the 1000 m  range would be at higher elevations, but would decrease in elevation in  the cooler northern latitudes. For example, there were two Pico/Feid  locations at about 2000 m elevation, with opposing aspects. The rust  was found only on the cooler, wetter northeast aspect.  Stalactiform blister rust is not known to go from pine to pine, and  like some other pine rusts, a herbaceous alternate host is involved in  completing the life cycle. The reported major alternate hosts, Castilleja  spp. and Pedicularis spp., are not major components of any habitat type  defined in the Abies lasiocarpa climax series where lodgepole pine is a  component (9, 10, 11) and stalactiform blister rust is frequent.  However, Castilleja spp. was observe~ growing in numerous disturbed  sites and Pedicularis spp. was common in moist locations. Both of  these conditions occur with high frequency along many forest roads.  Hence, an alternate host, although not present within the stand, is  close enough for stalactiform blister rust inoculum to be wind-carried  to neighboring stands.  The rust-infected lodgepole pine trees studied in this project  apparently were not excellent host trees for stem decays or bark beetle  17  J  infestations. Inoculum for decays and beetle populations were present in  the study areas, but perhaps not in amounts large enough to overcome  unknown physiological mechanisms that prevented their establishment in  rusted lodgepole pine. Rodent-feeding on only the diseased tissues  indicates that some physiological changes certainly do occur due to  rust, but apparently not the changes necessary to encourage establishemnt  of other problems. It is likely that the conclusion of Kulhavy et al.  (6) regarding the positive mountain pine beetle interaction with rusted  lodgepole pine may have been coincidental to an epidemic population of  the beetle in the area they studied and therefore did not represent the  normal relationships between it and stalactiform blister rust infected  lodgepole pine.  CONCLUSION  In Idaho, stalactiform blister ' rust is associated with stands  dominated by lodgepole pine and located in cool, dry sites on mid to  upper elevations throughout an elevational range of approximately 100 om .  In central Idaho, this range is approximately from 1500 m to 2400 m  elevation, but we suggest this would be at higher elevations in southern  latitudes and lower elevations in northern latitudes. Moisture and  temperature interactions and elevation and stand compositions are  conditions associated with stalactiform rust, whereas slope percent and  aspect were non-descriptive of hazard stands. The rust occurred independently  of many diseases and insect problems of lodgepole pine.  18  LITERATURE CITED  1. ANDERSON, N. A., D. W. FRENCH, and R. L. ANDERSON. 1967.

FOREST, WILDLIFE AND RANGE  EXPERIMENT STATION  Technical Report 14  September 1981  Simplified Field Viewer for Panoramic Transparencies  William A. Befort  A new field stereoviewing apparatus for high altitude  optical bar panoramic photography has been designed in  an effort to overcome problems of weight and bulk asso­dated  with earlier devices. The new system employs COIll­mercially  available stereoscopic eyeglasses in place of a  conven tional stereoscope.  The viewing system has two components: the eye­glasses,  and a photo holder which holds the two transpar­encies  of a stereopair in proper alignment, illuminating them  by transmitted ligllt.  The glasses ~mployed in testing the viewer were  manufactured by Ogden Vision Center, 3475 Harrison  Blvd., Ogden, Utah. An eye base (interpupillary distance)  of 75 millimeters and a working distance of 4 in ches (from  the photographs) were specified; this combination gave good  magnification (about 3.5x) and easy stereo-image fusion for  most users. The lenses of these glasses swing up out of the  wearer's line of sight when not in use. Prescription lenses  may be fitted behind the stereo lenses; without prescrip­tion  lenses, the stereo glasses cost $60-70 per pair.

During the study  period, a year of above-average precipitation, seedling  growth under shrubs was not significantly different from  seedling growth in the cleared strips.  INTRODUCTION  Tree regeneration on warm, dry southerly exposures  in northern Idaho frequently poses some difficulty. If  successful reforestation is not promptly carried out follow­ing  wildfire or site preparation, shrubs and forbs will  occupy these harsh sites. This vegetation competes with  tree seedlings for moisture, light, and nutrients, and pro­vides  habitat for small mammals that can damage young  trees. In the absence of adequate coniferous cover these  sites often develop into mature shrubfields, preventing  establishment of commercial stands.  To reclaim mature shrubfields for artificial reforesta­tion,  Stewart (1978) and Gratkowski (1974) recommended  using mechanical or chemical site preparation, prescribed  burning, or a combination of the three methods to eliminate o Universityofldaho  or reduce competition. Selection of site preparation method  depends on steepness of slope, soil erodibility, herbicide  effectiveness, fuel level, degree of disturbance desired and  other interrelated site factors. Under some conditions these  methods create microsite changes that may be detrimental  to seedling establishment and development. In addition,  site preparation may not achieve the desired results and  may not be necessary.  Although there is little disagreement on the impor·  tance of eliminating grass competition, some investigators  have questioned the assumption that shrub competition  on harsh sites has detrimental effects on seedling growth  (Coffman 1975, Ryker and Potter 1970, Youngberg 1966).  They have observed that much of the natural regeneration  of various conifers on harsh environments in the western  states has occurred within the shade of shrubs or trees.  The implication is that the benefits of shade outweigh the  effects of competition for soil moisture.  This note reports on the feasibility of planting Doug·  las·fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Mirb.] Franco)  under shrubs on harsh environments without extensive  site preparation. Although this case·history study does not  represent a wide range of habitats, it does yield trends  which may prove useful in planning for shrub-field regener­ation.  The objective of this study was to answer the follow·  ing questions:  1. Is there a significant difference in first-year  survival and growth between Douglas·fir planted  under dense natural shade (shrub) and in the  open?  2. To what degree does animal damage affect  first-year survival and growth of Douglas-fir  planted in dense shade and in adjacent open  strips?  DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY SITES  The sites se lected for this study are located in the  Walde and Cabin Creek drainages on the Lochsa Ranger  District, Clearwater National Forest. They are approxi·  mately two air mi les apart and are typical of north Idaho  shrubfields that have developed on harsh sites following  clearcutting, prescribed burning, and unsuccessful planting.  The Walde Creek site and the Cabin Creek site were  clearcut and prescribed burned in the mid·1960s. They  were planted with bare root grand fir (Abiesgrandis [Dougl.]  Lindl.) and Douglas-fir in 1964 and 1966, respectively.  When these plantations fa iled, fundi ng lim itations pre·  ve nted prom pt re plant ing. Both sites consequently devel·  oped into dense shrubfields with only widely scattered  conifers. The primary shrub species on these sites included  Rocky mountain maple (Acer glabrum Torr.). serviceberry  (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.). ninebark (Physocarpus  malvaceus (Greene) Kuntze). oceanspray (Holodiscus  discolor (Pursh) Maxim.). scouler willow (Salix scouleriana  Barratt), Pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites (Pursh) Raf.).  snow berry (Symphoricarpos albus (L.) Blake). red stem  ceanothus (Ceanothus sanguineus Pursh)' and evergreen  ceanothus (Ceanothus velutinus Dougl.). The last species  comprises approx imately 80 percent of the shrub volume  with heights of 4 to 7 feet.  The Walde Creek study site primarily maintains a  south aspect with slope angles of 37 to 45 percent. The  Cabin Creek site includes aspects ranging from south to  west and slope angles of 24 to 50 percent.  The soil association for both sites was identified as  the Jughandle Series (Webb et al. 1971). This soil series  has highly productive deep soils that are excessively drained .  They have a thin organic layer underlain by brown and light·  yellowish·brown sandy loam. Below is pale to very pale  brown coarse sand. These soils range from strongly acidic  to slightly acidic.  Walde Creek study site elevation is 4,300 feet (1310  m). and Cabin Creek, 4,400 feet (1341 m). Both are ident·  ified as grand fir/pachistima (Abies grandisjPachistima  myrsinites) habitat type (Daubenmire and Daubenmire  1968). Annual average rainfall is approximately 36 inches  (91 .5 cm). with a growing season of 70 to 90 days.  METHODS AND PROCEDURES  To compare open-planted trees with trees planted  under shrubs, we cleared and planted 8- to lO-foot-wide  strips in each shrubfield in May 1981. These strips were  grouped into four areas with similar aspects and slopes.  Experienced planters placed bareroot 2·0 Douglas·  fir in each area. They planted trees in the middle of the  open str ips at 8·foot intervals, after first scalping an 18·  inch section of ground. Bark, a rock or branch was placed  to shade the lower part of the seed ling from direct solar  radiation. The spacing for trees planted under shrubs varied  with shrub density. Planters also required a safe area for  swinging their planting tool. Each planting site was scalped,  but the stems of the seedlings were not shaded. Each tree  planter was assigned to plant a cleared strip and an adja·  cent shrubfield area. Planting dates were May 21 through  May 28.  Half of the trees in the open and under shru bs were  protected from animal damage th rough the use of plastic  mesh tubes, each secured wi th two spiral pi ns.  I ndividuaJ tree and site data were recorded immed­iately  after planting and again in October, after the end of  the first growing season. Data collected included seedling  survival, first-year tree height growth, tree planter, aspect,  area, animal protection, treatment (under shrubs vs. open),  slope angle, spring shrub volume, fall shrub volume, ini­tial  tree height, and animal damage.  RESULTS  Animal Damage  Sixty-nine percent of all trees planted without ani­mal  protection were damaged (Table 1). Without the  plastic mesh protection, 75 percent of the seedlings in the  open strips and 63 percent of those under the shrubs were  damaged. Only 6 percent of all trees covered with the mesh  tubes were damaged. Most of this damage occurred on new  growth when the terminal leader grew out of the tube and  was exposed to feeding injury.  Growth  First-season growth was not significantly (0.05  level) related to treatment (shade vs. open), although there  was a slight trend toward increased growth for trees planted  in the open (2.60 inches as compared with 2.46 inches for  undamaged trees planted under the shrubs) . Other variables  not sign ificantly associated with first season growth in­cluded  tree planter, aspect, slope angle, spring shrub volume  and fall shrub volume. A trend toward greater height growth  on the southwest to west aspects was noted, but was not  statistically significant (a ll possible aspects were not rep­resented).  First-season growth was significantly (0.05 level)  related to animal damage, initial height, animal protection  and area (Figure 1). Animal damage consisted primarily of  rabbits feeding on the terminal leaders and reducing tree  height. Larger stock grew better than smaller stock as shown  by the significance of initial height in predicting height  growth. This was not unexpected since Emmingham and  Waring (1973) found a similar initial height to growth  relationship. The plastic mesh tubes not only did an excel­lent  job of protecting the seedlings from first growing  season animal damage, but also were related to growth of  those trees not damaged by animals (Figure 1). Light that is  high in far-red is known to stimu late stem elongation, and  this may explain the slightly greater growth of seed lings  protected by the yellow tubes the first year (Marquis  1977).  The differences in growth by area can only be ex­plained  by the variable intensity of animal damage (Table  2). For example, the highest incidence of animal damage  (47 percent) occurred on area 4. Other areas had less damage  and greater net height growth. The reason for the difference  in animal damage is not clear since animal habitat on all  areas appeared to be unifom. The variance within sites is  equally perplexing. Area 3, with 15 percent animal damage,  is only 1400 feet from area 2, which received 40 percent  animal damage.  Table 1.

However, it is nearly equal to the 88 percent  survival of combined plantings during 1981. Good sur­vival  can probably be attributed to the above-average grow­ing  season precipitation. During the critical months (May­September)  of the growing season, weather stations at  Kooskia, Idaho (62-year record) and Pierce, Idaho (19-  year record) recorded above average precipitation of 2.11  inches (5.4 em) and 4.73 inches (12.0 em), respectively.  Most of this above normal precipitation came during June  and July, with August and September slightly drier than  average.  Fifty-one of the 500 study trees died during the first  growing season. Pocket gophers accounted for the loss of  only two trees, corresponding to the light pocket gopher  activity observed. However, pocket gopher damage is often  heaviest in the winter (Barnes 1973), and this study does  not include winter 1981 /1982 mortality data. Four trees  were killed by elk trampling. Elk used several of the open  strips as travel routes, hence 75 percent of the elk-related  mortality and tree damage occu(red in the open strips. Two  trees were not fou nd. The remaini ng 43 trees died of what  appeared to be moisture stress, or from poor tree planting  or handling. Thirteen of these 43 trees sustained other  mammal damage prior to death.  ... c  ~  &gt;  ~.. .z.  "".ii.i  100  110  80  ~'80.  1000 2000 3000 4000  SHRUB VOLUME PER ACRE (Cubic Fooll  Figure 2. Percent survival by aspect and fa ll shrub volume.  Animal damage did not significantly affect (0.05  level) individual seedling mortal ity. Other factors that did  not significantly affect survival included tree planter, area,  animal protection, treatment, slope, spring shrub volume  and initial height.  Factors significantly associated with tree survival  were aspect and fall shrub volume. As expected, survival  was lower on south to southwest aspects. Fall shrub volume  has a positive relationship with survival even on west as·  peets (Figure 2). Trees planted in areas with greater shrub  volumes had better survival. It is not clear why treatment  (shrub clearing) was not significantly associated with sur­vival  while increasing shrub volumes were related to in­creased  survival. I t is possible that the seedlings in the  cleared strips benefited from the shade provided by the  rapidly resprouting shrub in the strips (resprouts were 2  to 3 feet high at the end of the first growing season).  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  This case-history study has provided a small portion  of the information needed to determine the feasibi lity of  planting Douglas-fir under shrubs on harsh environments.  Conclusions that are warranted for the first-year growing  season include:  1. Douglas-fir seedlings planted under shrubs can be  expected to survive as well as those planted in clear·  ings.  2.  3.  4.  Damage to seedlings by rodents and hares is extensive  and significantly associated with first-year growth  but not to survival. Animal protection for individual  seedlings or control of animal popu lations is neces­sary  to assure success of planting trees in shrubfields.  Plastic mesh tubes provide excellent protection from  animal damage and have a positive relationship with  first-year growth. However, better methods of se·  curing and supporting these tubes need to be ex·  plored.  Animal populations vary by area; methods for pre­dicting  animal damage and/or popu lation levels  need to be developed .  5. Larger planting stock grows better on south and west  aspects.  6. During years of above average precipitation, shrub  volume is not re lated to first-year seed ling growth.  7. Shrub density appears to be positively correlated with  first·year seedling survival.  8.  9.  First-year mortal ity is greater on south aspects than  on the more favorab le west aspects.  Browsi ng of planted Douglas-fir seedlings by deer  and elk is not a severe problem in these north Idaho  shrubfields.  L  LITERATURE CITED  Barnes, Jr., V.G. 1973.

UNIVERSITY OF I it j U~i H;; \  ABSTRACT  With few exceptions, participants in forest plann ing  in the Pacific Northwest are a rather homogeneous group  with respect to these sociodemographic characteristics:  they are men (84.8%); white (97.3%); middle-aged (av­erage  age of 47.1 years); well-educated (average 15.7 years  education); have high family incomes (65 .1% earn $25,000  or more); and are more likely to be political moderates  (45.3%) and independents (40.8%). Although the five  public participation methods rated as being most desirable  by participants were not offered by any of the forests in  the study, in total, 92% of participants had been active in  the USDA Forest Service public participation process  and/or a variety of other tactics. Major recommendations  to public agencies include inventorying the people resource,  offering new methods of participation and recognizing the  public as professional peers who can make important  contributions to forest planning. o Universityofldaho  OBJECTIVES  Public participation plays an important role in Forest  Service planning and decision-making, yet little empirical  datt! Me available about what kinds of people drc participat­ing;  why they get involved; and what methods of participa­tion  they prefer. This report for the survey respondents  addresses the above questions. i  METHODS  During the summer of 1983, forest plan mailing lists  were obtained from four national forests in Idaho and  Washington. The forests selected were: (1) the Mt. Baker·  Snoqualmie; (2) the Idaho Panhandle; (3) the Clearwater;  and (4) the Nezperce. These forests are believed to be  representative of the Pacific Northwest's rural and urban  areas. A random sample of individuals and organizations  from among the four mailing lists was chosen.  A mail questionnaire was constructed, implemented  and analyzed according to Dillman's (1978) Total Design  Method which is based on social exchange theory and care­fu  l administration of the survey instrument. This method  was selected because it c.onsistently achieves response rates  of 60 to 75 percent with the general public (Dillman 1978).  Of the 1,396 questionnaires which were mailed, 49  were undeliverable because of incorrect addresses, and 92  were not completed because of illness, death, or other rea­sons,  leaving 1,255 eligible respondents. The results re­ported  here are based on 984 (78%) useable questionnaires.  The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package  for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc. 1983).  Although the response rate was high, 28 of the  271 nonrespondents were randomly selected and an at­tempt  was made to reach them by telephone. Ten nonre­spondents  were successfully reached who were willing to  answer six questions related to the study. There was no  statistically significant (&lt;X = .05) difference between these  nonrespondents and the respondents on the following  variables measured: age, place of residence, length of  residence, and organized vs. nonorganized representation.  Sixty percent of the nonrespondents were inactive vs. 21.5%  for respondents. The average educational level for nonre­spondents  was 13.6 years vs. 15.7 years for respondents.  Thus, although two characteristics of nonrespondents were  different, the sample is presumed to be reasonably repre·  sentative of the population.  1 For a complete analysis of the study, see: Williams, Kevin  L. 1985. Public participation in national forest planning.  Moscow, Idaho: University of Idaho. Unpublished M.S.  thesis.  RESULTS  Orga nized vs. Nonorganized Re presen tation  One key factor explored in this study was the distinc­tion  of participants who represented an organization (or­ganized  representation) from those who represented them­selves  (nonorganized representation) . The highest percen·  tage of participants represented themselves (57.3%) while  the remainder represented an organization (42.7%). This  shows that it is not just the organized interests in society  who are participating in national forest planning processes,  but nonorganized individuals also wish to participate.  Those representing organizations reported member­ships  of ""more than 1000"" in 38% of the cases, ""between  1 00 and 1000"" in 34% of the cases and "" less than 1 00""  in the remaining 28%. The geographic representation of  the organizations was as follows: local - 24%; state - 31%;  regional· 23%; national· 17%; and other· 5%.  Active vs. I nactive Pa rticip ation  A second important factor was the distinction of ac­tive  from inactive participants. Active participants were  defined as those who participate in Forest Service spon­sored  public participation activities in addition to receiving  information through the mail. I nactive participants were  defined as those who do not participate in Forest Service  sponsored activities beyond the act of receiving information  through the mail. The highest percentage of participants  was active (78.5%) while the remainder was inactive (21.5%).  In total, 92% of participants had participated in Forest  Service sponsored activities and/or through political, legis­lative,  and judicial processes, such as writing or calling a  congressman (57%), filing an appeal (8%), or lobbying  (13%).  Place of Reside nce  Participants were classified as rural, urban or metro­politan  . Thirty-five percent of participants were living in  an urbanized area with at least 50,000 inhabitants (metro·  politan), 34% were living in places with between 2,500 and  49,999 inhabitants (urban), and 31% were living on ranches  or farms, and in towns or villages smaller than 2,500  inhabitants (rural). Additional insights were hoped to be  gained by distinguishing between participants based on  their place of residence because it is widely accepted that  there are place of residence differences related to environ­mental  concern.  I nterest Orientation  110· It  A f inal distinction was made between participants  based on their self·identified interest orientation. The high­est  percentage of participants was found to be representing  preservation or environmental interests (27.2%) followed  by timber interests (20.5%). recreation interests (15.6%)  and f ish and wildl ife interests (13.5%). The remaining 23%  represented a variety of interests assoc iated with the na­tional  forests, such as mining, Native American interests,  ranching, and water.  Sociodemographic Characteristics  With few exceptions, partcipants are a rather homo­geneous  group with respect to sociodemographic character­istics:  they are men, white, middle-aged, well-educated,  have high family incomes, and are more likely to be moder­ate  and politically independent. Sociodemographic charac­teristics  of participants in the entire sample are presented in  Table 1.  Four important differences were found between  participants with timber interests and those with preserva­tion  or environmental interests. A greater proportion of  those with timber interests was male (92%). Republican  (49%). conservative (52%). and had high family incomes.  (79% over $25.000)' whereas for participants with preser­vation  or environmental interests the data were as follows:  male (76%). Republican (14%). conservative (16%). and  fam ily incomes over $25.000 (60' ). These data highlight  underlying differences in attitudes and beliefs between  these groups.  Eighty-eight percent of partic ipants in the entire  sample were from Idaho and Washington. Because of this  sizable proportion, some comparisons can be made between  participants in 1983 and the resid ents of Idaho and Wash­ington  according to the 1980 census.  First, if we compare the educational attainment of  participants with that of Idaho and Washington residents  we find that 63.0% of participants in the entire sample have  completed four or more years of co llege whereas on ly 16.1%  of Idaho residents and 19.1% of Washington residents had  done so (United States BureauoftheCensus 1981a. 1981b).  Further, 65.1% of forest planning participants had an an­nual  family income of $25,000 or more compared to 27.2%  of Idaho residents and 40.3% of Washington residents  (United States Bureau of the Census 1981a. 1981b). It  is obvious that participants are general ly well-educated and  from upper income levels.  T his does not necessarily mean that upper middle  class Americans are the only ones concerned with national  forest planning. I n a recent USDA-sponsored survey on  environmental concerns, Mohai ( 1984) found that, OCthe  upper middle class link is not a link between the upper  middle class and environmental concern but a link between  the upper middle class and political activism.""

The survey participants were asked to rate the reasons on  a 5-point scale ranging from extremely important to not  important. The relative importance of these reasons are  shown in Figure 1.  All respondents were asked to rate reasons why they  were interested in participating in forest planning- again  on a 5-point scale ranging from extremely important to  not important (see Figure 1).  The most important reason people are participating in  national forest planning activities is to defend an interest  in or ac tivity on public forest land which they feel is  threatened. This reason is closely followed by motivations  to encourage the conservation of natural resources and to  see that economic effects of proposed actions are analyzed  and considered. Analyses also revealed that defending a  special interest is more important to those representing  organizations than to those representing themselves and to  active participants than to inactive participants. Motiva­tions  related to economic effects are more important to  those representing organizations, those who are active,  those living in rural areas and those representing timber  interests. Motivations related to conservation interests are  more important to active participants and those represent­ing  preservation or environmental interests. Motivations  related to the desire for knowledge are highest for active  participants and those from rural areas.  How Respondents Participated  Sixteen methods of participation were offered by one  or more of the four national forests in the study. The five  most commonly used methods in descending order were:  presentations (62.1 %), response forms (61.5%), personal  letters (56.3%), telephone calls (51.6%), and workshops  (34.6%). PartiCipants with timber interests attended pre­sentations  (73.5%) and open houses (23.5%) more than  other groups whereas those with fish and wildlife interests  attended open houses less than others. Personal letters  were sent more often (69.9%) by those with preservation or  environmental interests.  Preferences for Methods  Respondents were also presented with a list of 28  public participation methods that have been used by forests  and/or suggested in the public participation literature.  They were then asked to select the three methods which  they considered to be most, second most and third most  desirable.  One method of participation was consistently ranked  as being the most desirable: citizen representatives on  Forest Service policy-making bodies. Although such policy­making  bodies can vary in-size, composition and function,  such bodies may be the official decision-making structure  (Arnstein and Metcalf 1976) . Thus, it appears that, in  general, participants desire a more direct participltory role  in guiding the decision-making process.  The five methods ranked as being most desirable by  participants in the entire sample had not been offered by  any of the forests in the study according to the public  information officers. These methods, ranked in descending  order, were: citizen representatives on Forest Service  policy-making bodies, formal public hearings, survey of  citizens' attitudes and opinions, open public meetings, and  meetings held for residents of a specific community.  Participant preference for methods is an asset managers can  use to stimu late better public participation.  The five least desirable methods ranked in ascending  order were: radio programs, game simulations, interactive  TV-based participation, computer-based techniques, and  open houses.  ,  •  •  Figure 1.

To achieve status or power  Not important  Respondents were also asked to rate each of the 28  pub lic part icipation methods on a S-point likert-type con­tinuum:  very desirable (S.O), desirable (4.0), neither desir­able  nor undesirable (3.0), undesirable (2.0) and very unde­sirable  (1.0). The 28 methods and the mean scores on the  S-point scale are listed in Table 2. Eighteen methods were  rated statistically significantly higher desirability by those  respondents with environmental or preservation interests  than those with timber interests (see Table 2). Two  methods were rated a statisticaly significantly (cr; .OS)  higher desirab ility by those respondents with timber  interests than those with environmental or preservation  interest (see Table 2).  In almost all cases, those participants who had parti­cipated  in a particular method rated that method as more  desirable than those who had not participated in that  method. It dppedrs as though exposure to a method posi­tively  affects a person's preference for the method.  Costs of Participating  Twenty-nine percent of the respondents reported  spending ""more than 1 day but less than 1 week per year""  learning about or participating in the development of na­tional  forest plans and another 30% reported spending  ""more than 1 week but less than 1 month per year.""  Respondents were asked what dollar cost per year they  have incurred, and reported the fo llowing: less than $10 per  year -23%; between $10-$SO per year - 18%; between  $SO-$100 per year - 11%; between $100-$SOO per year -  17%; and over $SOO per year - 19""Al.

Data collected about the people participating in  forest planning can be used by forest managers to under­stand  the public and to design public participation pro­grams  for specific groups.  It is hoped that this study wi ll help both the public  and forest managers to more effectively participate in  forest planning on America's national forests.  REFERENCES  Arnstein, S. and E.

Wood users are more likely than non·users to live  in rural areas; have larger families; and live in a single·family  home that they own. Forty percent of those considering  adopting wood may do so even if there is no change or a  decrease in the cost of their present fuel.

Over 80  percent of wood users collect their own wood and drive an  average of 45 miles, one way, for 5 trips per season. All  respondents are more concerned about the supply of wood  from Idaho's forests than they are about other wood­related  problems. However, non-users rate air pollution,  inconvenience, messiness , and increased fire hazard as more  important problems than users. Based on data from this  study , the number of cords of wood removed annually  from Idaho's forest lands is about 660,000 cords. An addi·  tional 200,000 cords per year will be needed by 1990 if all  households currently considering adopting wood do so.  ~ Universityofldaho  OBJECTIVES  An important component of Idaho's energy picture  is the use of firewood to meet residential heating needs.  The overall purpose of this study was to better understand  the use of wood energy for residential heating throughout  the state of Idaho. Specific objectives were:  I) To determine the extent of adoption of wood  energy for residential heating in Idaho;  2) To determine and compare the sociodemographic  characteristics of wood users and non-users;  3) To estimate  a) the likelihood of non· users adopting wood in  the next five years given changes in alternate heat energy  costs; and  b) the probable sources of wood for people  who change to wood;  4) To assess the amount, sources, motivations, and  collecting behaviors of wood users; and  5) To evaluate the user's interest in and support of  forest management practices that increase the supply  and/or availability of firewood on forested lands. This  report for the survey respondents addresses these concerns.  METHODS  In April 1985, a random sample of 1314 names and  addresses was selected from the names listed in telephone  books for the state of Idaho. A mail questionnaire was  constructed and implemented according to Dillman's  (1978) Total Design Method, which is based on social ex­change  theory and careful administration of the survey  instrument. A non-response survey was conducted by ran­domly  selecting non.respondents and attempting to contact  them by telephone. Following coding and data entry, the  data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the  Social Sciences (SPSS 1983).  The state was divided into seven geographic regions  based on forest resource characteristics (available species  and productivity), climatic zones, and population patterns.  The Boise Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA)  was also delineated as an eighth region. This allowed a  stratified sample to be taken to insure that all areas of  the state had sufficient representation.  RESULTS  Of the 1314 questionnaires which were mailed, 165  were not delivered because of incorrect or incomplete  addresses availab le in the telephone books. Fifty-three  questionnaires were returned uncompleted because of  death , moving out of the state, or unwillingness to partici­pate  for other reasons. This left 1096 eligible respondents.  The results reported here are based on 774 useable ques­tionnaires  (a 71 percent response rate). Response rates by  geographic regions of the state ranged from 64 percent  to 74 percent.  Seventeen percent of the non-respondents were ran­domly  selected and an attempt was made to reach them by  telephone. There were no statistically significant differ­ences  (at the 0.05 level) between respondents and the  households reached who had not returned the mail ques­tionnaire  on any of the seven questions asked: age, educa­tion  , home ownership, wood use, likelihood a non-user will  adopt wood in the next five years, use of electricity or  natural gas as sources of heat, and place of residence.  Additional questions were asked of those contacted  by telephone who reported using wood as a source of heat  in their home. There was no statistically significant differ­ences  between mail respondents who are wood users and  those wood users who were contacted by telephone on the  following variables; number of cords of wood burned in  1984-85 ; use of wood as the main heat source; primary  reason for using wood for heat; proportion collecting their  own wood; and the proportion living in urban areas. The  following statistically significant differences were fauna  between mail respondents who use wood and those who  were contacted by telephone: telephone respondents do  not drive as far to obtain wood; are less likely to have  electricity as another source of heat in their home and more  likely to have gas; are more likely to use fireplaces to burn  their wood; and a higher proportion live in rural areas.  Thus, with these few exceptions, it is assumed that respon­dents  represent the population being surveyed.  Adoption of Wood Energy in Idaho  Wood energy has been widely adopted for residential  heating in Idaho. Fifty-seven percent of all respondents  identified their household as one that uses wood. Respon­dents  were almost equally split between those who say  wood is the main source of heat in their home and those  who report wood is a secondary heat source. Seventeen  percent of the respondents are considering adopting wood  energy in the next five years. Therefore, only 26 prcent of  the survey respondents expressed no interest in using wood  energy. The use of wood energy is considerably higher than  the 45 percent reported by the Pacific Northwest Residen­tial  Energy Survey (PNRE) (1980) and the 46 percent re­ported  by Skog and Watterson (1983). Both of these  studies were reporting data for 1980. One-third of the  respondents in this 1985 study reported they have begun  using wood since 1980.  .,  ,.  ---- ' - .,  ""  SD  , ~  I;(  ·U37  me./ q Sociodemographic Characteristics to use wood: forest worker, construction/craft, farmer, and  truck driver.  A comparison of the sociodemographic character­istics  of wood users and non-users is presented in Table 1.  We see that non-users arc older, tend to live in larger towns,  have smaller households, and are more likely to be renting  their home and living in a multi·family building than users  are. There is no stdtisticdlly significant difference between  wood users dnd non-users in education, income or the  number of years they have lived in the area where they now  live. There were no differences between wood users and  non-users in the following occupations: professional, cleri­cal,  laborer, salesperson, and factory or mill worker. Re­spondents  giving their occupation as ""retired"" or ""home­maker""  were less like ly to be wood users, whereas those  respondents in the following occupations were more likely  Changes in Wood Use  Forty percent of those households not currently  using wood stated that they might use wood fo r heating in  the next five years. This represents approximately 50,000  Idaho households that are potentidl wood energy adopters  in the next five years.  Sl ightly over half of these potential wood energy  adopters have used wood in the past even though they are  not currently using wood.

Thus, for nearly 40  percent of the possible users, the decision appears to be  unrelated to alternative fuel price increases. One-fourth  state that current fuel costs must increase 10 to 25 per­cent  before they will adopt wood and one-fourth say it  will take a 50' percent increase in the price of their current  fuel. The remainder will not adopt wood unless their cur­rent  fuel costs increase 75 percent or more.  Thirty percent of the possible adopters say wood  energy would become their main heat source. The equip­ment  most likely to be used is a wood stove (57%) fo llowed  by a fireplace (26%) and a fireplace insert (22%). Table 2  gives information on how possible users say they will obtain  wood-burning equipment and whether they will purchase or  collect their firewood. If these respondents do begin using  wood, they estimate using 4.67 cords per heati ng season.  Possible users estimate using nearly one cord more per year  than current users, who report burning 3.77 cords per  household per year. The higher estimate by possible users  may be because of their inexperience in using wood.  Table 2.

First, use is almost equally split between  use of wood as a main heat source and use as a secondary  heat source.  The number of cords reported being used during the  1984-85 heating season is presented in Table 3 for all  respondents. and then partitioned by users for which wood  is the main heat source versus the secondary heat source;  users who collect their own wood versus those who buy all  of their wood; and users living in rural, urban or metro-politan  areas. I The differences in wood use were as expec­ted:  those who use wood as their main heat source burn  nearly twice as much as those using wood or a secondary  heat source; those who collect their own wood use more  than those who buy wood; and those living in rural areas  burn more wood than those living in urban or metro­politan  areas. Sources of wood for both current users and  possible users are shown in Table 4.  Table 3. Average number of cords burned by wood users during  the 1984-85 winter.

Eight reasons were listed as possible motivations for  using wood to heat one's home. The mean ratings for all  respondents using wood are shown in Table 5.  Table 6 compares the type of wood-burni ng equip­ment,  collecting versus buying wood, and alternate sources  of heat for all respondents, including those who use wood  as their main heat and those who use wood for secondary  heat. As might be expected, respondents using wood as  the main heat source use more efficient wood-burning  equipment and are less likely to buy their wood.  Two-thirds of the collectors report coll ecting all of  their own wood. Seven percent of all wood users buy  less than 25 percent; 5 percent buy from 25 to 50 percen t;  and 5 percent buy more than 50 percent of their wood.  The remaining seventeen percent of all wood users reported  that they bought all of their wood, or it was supplied by  someone else.  Table 5. Reasons respondents use wood for residential  heating.

There is still a clear prefer·  ence for standing dead wood or dead and down wood, and  little preference for slash piles and logs yarded to the road·  side. Not surprisingly, approximately four·fifths of the  collectors are still unwi ll ing to go more than 300 feet from  their veh icle to obtain wood. The distances being driven  are still quite high and the vehicles being used to transport  wood have not changed. The most important reason to  collect their own firewood has remained ""to save money"",  followed by ""self·sufficiency"" and the opportunity to be  in the woods. A decline in personal health is sti ll the prj·  mdry reason a collector might decide to buy wood.  Support of Forest Management Practices  Respondents who collect firewood were asked to  rate their preferences for fuelwood management practices  that forest managers might implement to did fue/wood  collectors. Each practice WdS rated on a 6-point scale  ranging from ""strongly prefer"" to ""no opinion"". Average  ratings were calcu lated for each practice and are reported  in Table 8.  The most strongly preferred practice by collectors  is that of allowing collectors to get firewood before an area  is burned for management pu rposes. Some changes in pre­scr  ibed burn ing practices have been implemented by 7 of  the 10 national forests in Idaho (Force 1984a, b). Planting  areas with trees that would be desirable firewood in the  future received support from collectors, but has not been  implemented on any national forest in Idaho (Force 1984a,  b).  Although these data provide forest managers with  information on the acceptance of current f irewood manage­ment  practices and potential acceptance of other practices  they may decide to implement in the next few years, they  also illuminate some inconsistencies in the responses.  Only 8 percent of the collectors report using logging slash  or logs yarded to the roadside (Table 7) although these  practices are given reasonably high preferences as fuel­wood  management practices respondents would like to see  forest managers adopt (Table 8).  Problems Associated With Using Wood  Respondents were asked to rate six wood heat·re­lated  problems on a scale of 6 (extremely important) to 1  (not important). The mean ratings are reported in Tab le 9  for all respondents, wood users, and non-users. We see that  non-users rate four of the six problems as having statisti­cally  significantly greater importance than wood users rated  them. These problems associated with using wood energy  for residential heating are factors that need to be addressed  if wood energy use is to be more widely adopted. However,  respondents are more concerned about the supply of wood  from Idaho's forests than they are about other problems.  This is a concern that forest managers can address.  •  •  l  Table 8.

CONCLUSIONS  Data from this study show that the use of wood  energy is an important factor in Idaho's overall energy pic­ture.  With nearly 175,000 households using an average of  3.77 cords of wood to meet some of their heating needs,  Idaho's forest lands must supply 660,000 cords of wood  annually. Up to an additional 200,000 cords per year  would be needed by 1990 if all those households currently  considering adopting wood decide to do so. The impact  of such widespread use of wood energy must also be con­sidered  by energy planners trying to predict demand for  alternate fuels.

This chemical inhibits the  transpiration rate of green plants by reducing gaseous exchange within  the stomatal openings. It retards respiration by the same mechanism.  The potential use of this chemical is to increase soil moisture storage  and stream flow of forested watersheds by aerial spraying of an area  immediately after peak runoff. The field study occurred between 6 and  10 June 1974, when silicone antitranspirant was applied to a small  drainage in North Idaho.  Investigators have shown that the application of toxicants to an  aquatic ecosystem could cause pronounced increases in insect drift.  Such an increase immediately after introduction of a toxicant would  suggest acute stress and possible toxic effects to other organisms of  the ecosystem. Drift net samples have effectively been used by Gibson  and Chapman (1972) and Brusven and MacPhee (1974) to evaluate in situ the  effects of selective toxicants on nontarget species. Therefore, this  approach was selected for part of the study.  1 Published with the approval of the Director,  and Range Experiment Station As Contribution No. 11.  Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.

There-fore,  any harmful effects of silicone emulsion on stream insects could  indirectly affect the production of trout and transfer of energy from  one trophic level to another.  Prior to the field study, the maximum concentrations of silicone  antitranspirant (Dow Corning XEF-4-3561) that representative fish and  insects could tolerate were determined in static bioassays. Tests were  also made to determine the toxicity of a surfactant mixture (Ref. No. E-  2055-100) without silicone antitranspirant. The silicone antitranspirant  used in the field and laboratory studies is a series of dimethylsiloxane  polymers developed by Dow Corning Research Laboratory, Midland, Mich .  METHODS  Field Procedures  Two small tributaries of Benton Creek, a tributary of lower Priest  River, were selected for control and test streams. About 375 liters per  hectare (40 gallons per acre) of 5 percent solution of silicone emulsion  were applied by helicopter to the plants in the 26-hectare watershed of  the test creek. None was applied to the 20-hectare watershed of the  control.  The experimental plan was to determine pre-treatment and post -  treatment numbers of insects captured in control and test drift nets.  The emulsion was applied between 0800 and 1500 of 8 June.  An insect drift net (mesh size, 1 mm ) was placed at the outlet of  each channel of 2 water gauging stations. Station No. 4 was on the test  creek and Station No. 5 on the control creek, the numbers of these  stations being the same as those used in a master plan involving con-  L  - 3-  current research. The drift nets were large enough to contain the total  discharge and capture all drifting organisms in the streams (Fig. 1).  Fig. 1. Insect drift net  established below the  watergauging station of the  test creek (Station No. 4).  . Drift net samples were continuously taken for 96 hours except for 3  1-hour periods per day when the nets were emptied and washed . The nets  were emptied of their contents at 1300, 2100 and 0500 each 24-hour  period.  Sampling began at 1300 of 6 June and ended at 0500 of 10 June .  Samples were preserved for later enumeration and identification of  organisms in the laboratory. Diel water temperatures varied between 5  and 6 C.  A goodness of fit test was used to determine if statistieal inde-pendence  existed between treated and control drift samples for major  animal groups. The 2-day pre-treatment and 2-day post-treatment samples  formed units of data . Observed and empirically determined expected  values were compared in a 2 x 2 contingency table using chi-square to  test for independence. No statistical dependence due to treatment with  the silicone emulsion was deemed to exist for populations which had chi -  square values smaller than 3.841, P(«) &lt; 0.05, 1 d.f.  -4-  Bioassay Facilities and Procedures:  The silicone antitranspirant used in the bioassays was composed of  SO percent polydimethylsi loxane, 3.5 percent surfactant used as an  emulsifier, and 46.5 percent water.  Fish assays were made with University artesian well water. On 17  August 1972, the chemistry of the University artesian well water was as  follows: methyl orange alkalinity, 164 ppm; pH, 812; total hardness,  180 ppm; and total dissolved solids, 150 ppm.  Juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), 40 mm in fish  length, were obtained from a state fish hatchery at Rapid River, Ida.;  rainbow trout (Sa Zmo gairdneri), 31 mm in fork length, from Dworshak  National Fish Hatchery; pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus ), 85 mm in  fork l ength, were col lected by seine nets from local farm ponds. Stone­fly  (Arcynopteryx sp.) and caddis fly (LimnephiZus sp.) nymphs, 23 mm  and 26 mm in body length, respectively, were collected with a fine­meshed  dip net from the Palouse River near Laird Park, Ida . in March and  April of 1974.  On arrival at the laboratory, fish and aquatic i nsects were accli­mated  at l east overnight in large temperature controlled tanks or troughs  equipped with aerators. They were not fed. Each species was graded for  uniformity in size and placed in aerated, plastic bioassay aquaria for  one day prior to the addition of chemical. Different amounts of water  were used in assays: 60 liters for pumpkinseed sunfish; 20 liters for  chinook salmon; 10 liters for trout; and 5 liters for caddis fly and  stonefly nymphs which were assayed together. To avoid excessive handling  of fish and irisects prior to testing, exact loads were not determined  until bioassays were completed. Thus, the loads varied from 0.07 to  •  •  -5-  2.20 g of fish or insects per liter of water. Ideally not more than 1 g  of biomass per liter of water was to be used.  Rainbow trout, chinook salmon and insects tested with silicone  antitranspirant were acclimated and assayed at temperatures of 10, 14,  and 20 C (~ 1 C) simultaneously in 3 separated temperature controlled  laboratory rooms. Rainbow trout were acclimated and assayed at 15 C for  t he surfactant assays. Due to technical problems, these temperatures  were not always maintained, but for any set of assays, water tempera­tures  were relatively uniform.  The numbers of test organisms and different concentrations of  chemicals used in bioassays varied (Table 1). Observations were made at  the time indicated in Tables 2 and 3. The times of death were noted and  fish or insects were removed from aquaria as they succumbed.  Table 1.

Of these, 857 were netted in the test stream and 225 in the  control stream. The only other important invertebrate group was the  leech. Thirty-two leeches were captured in the test stream and 22 in  the control streams.  In spite of generally small sample sizes, the observed number of  organisms counted during the 48-hour post-treatment period as compared  with the calculated expected number, ranged a maximum of only 5 percent  for the four most numerous taxa (Table 4). In addition to the numbers  of mayfly, caddis fly and crane fly, the total of insects included 17  stoneflies, 25 midges and 2 Elmidae. The sample sizes of these 3 last  mentioned groups were too small to warrant a separate chi-square analysis  (Table 5). However, they were included together with other groups of  insects in Class Insecta.  -8-  The chi-square values that are indicated in Table 4 for leeches,  insects, mayflies and crane flies are less than the tabled value of  3.841, P(a:) &lt; 0.05, 1 d.f. Therefore, the observed number of organisms  was not significantly different from the expected number and thus we  deem that these invertebrate groups were not affected by the silicone  emulsion.  Drift-net analysis provided a useful means for evaluating the  short-term effects of silicone antitranspirant on benthos. If benthos  was adversely affected by the chemical, large increases in drift would  have been expected; such was not the case. Therefore, we conclude that  Table 4.

Approximate LC0, Lc50, and LC100 for rainbow trout with surfactant  are summarized in Table 3. The results show that the surfactant is more  toxic than the antitranspirant to the fish tested.  The laboratory bioassays indicate that the silicone antitranspirant  will not kill the test organism at recommended field doses and likely  will not kill other associated species.

Adams  Carl E. Dirks  Luke P. Powell  INTRODUCTION  Coating, pelleting and encapsulating seeds to facili­tate  sowing and germination have long been pursued as  regeneration alternatives in agriculture, range manage­ment,  and forestry. Although encapsulation and other  treatments have several possible benefits, no entirely  satisfactory methodology has yet been developed for use  in forestry.  Direct seeding as a forest regeneration alternative has  the advantage of low relative expense and rapid coverage  of large areas. There is also the advantage that seedlings  are established in place and are not subject to the root  injury and shock associated with transplanting. However,  this technique has not been highly successful in the  western U.S. due to drought conditions, seeds falling on  incompatible microsites, and severe depredation by birds  and rodents. As expensive genetically improved seed is  more widely used, broadcast seeding will likely become  even less acceptable.  Planting of bare-root or containerized seedlings over­comes  many of the problems associated with direct seed­ing.  Seedlings are produced in nursery seedbeds or  container greenhouses under controlled conditions for  outplanting in the field. Although this technique has  some definite advantages, it is also much more ex­pensive.  Encapsulation of conifer seed has been investigated  at the University of Idaho as an alternate to direct seed­ing  and planting of seedlings. This work began in 1974 at  the suggestion of John Dale (then a graduate student). A  pilot study was initiated by David L. Adams, professor of  silviculture, and Dale, now with the USDA Forest Service.  The ""seed wafer'' idea as developed by Paul E. Johnson  (Johnson et al. 1970) at Purdue University in 1969 (DeTar  and Johnson 1971) was initially intended for agricultural  applications in precision planting of small, irregularly  shaped vegetable seeds. The wafer is a round tablet, 1.9  em in diameter and 0.95 em thick, composed of a seed  The mention herein of specific products is not to be construed  as an endorsement of those products by the authors or by the  University of Idaho.  1  (or seeds) embedded in vermiculite and activated carbon  bound by methylcellulose. The wafer provides a favorable  environment for germination and is easy to plant. Wafers  are pressed into the soil by hand or the flat heel of a  boot. Various fertilizers, growth regulators, repellents, and  fungicides can be added to further enhance germination  and early growth. When the encapsulated seed is plant­ed  at or just beneath the soil surface, moisture is ab­sorbed  from the surrounding soil by the wafer medium  and is provided to the seed for starting the germination  process (DeTar 1973, Fraser 1973, Powell 1980).  The seed wafer has the following characteristics and  potential reforestation advantages.  1. The wafer is hygroscopic and is able to absorb  moisture from the surrounding soil, promoting rapid  seed germination. The available moisture in the  micropores of the vermiculite in the wafers is about  2.5 times that of a silt loam.  2. When wetted, the wafer expands and disintegrates,  forming an excellent anti-crustant over the seed  (DeTar 1971, 1973). This characteristic helps to over­come  problems with soil compaction.  3. The activated carbon in the wafer provides protec­tion  against herbicides, improving weed control  capabilities (DeTar 1971, 1973).  4. Fertilizers, rodent repellents, and other materials  may be added to the wafer mix, enhancing early  germination and seedling performance.  5. The wafers are inexpensive to prepare and to plant,  reducing regeneration costs.  6. The size and shape of the wafer allow for ease of  handling of the seed in the field and for precise  spacing of the seed within the area to be  regenerated.  The seed wafers used in the projects described in  this paper were manufactured in an electrically driven,  mechanical piston-cylinder machine built by Paul E.  Johnson at Purdue University and borrowed from William  DeTar at Western Illinois University. An alternative ma­chine  design has been proposed by Walter L. Moden, Jr.,  professor of agricultural engineering at the University of  Idaho. Moden's design features the use of air-operated  cylinders and electro-mechanical timers. A machine of  this type would greatly reduce manufacturing time,  hence, reducing wafer cost. The Johnson-DeTar machine  produces an average of 500 wafers per hour. An automat­ed  machine could produce an estimated 4000 wafers per  hour, reducing the cost from approximately $12/thousand  to less then $2/thousand (including labor and materials).  The purpose of this paper is to summarize the de­velopment  of the seed wafer concept at the University of  Idaho. Both positive and negative results are reported as  an aid to others working with similar projects. Field trials  for which follow-up data are not available have not been  included. Much of the work reported here is the result of  research conducted by graduate students in the Depart-  2  ment of Forest Resources. Results from several of the field  trials were provided from cooperating companies. Much  more detail on most of the reported projects is included  in the graduate theses by Dirks (1984), Powell (1980), and  Zak (1983).  FIELD STUDIES  Comprehensive replicated, seed wafer field tests in­volving  a wide range of planting sites, dates, species, and  planting techniques have not been conducted. However,  the field trials which have been established provide case  study documentation which indicates conditions where  the use of seed wafers may be a viable reforestation al­ternative.  Following are brief descriptions of the field  plantings for which results were monitored.  Pilot field study-1974  (John Dale and David Adams)  The study  In a pilot field study, wafers with ponderosa pine  and Douglas-fir seed were planted on clearcuts on the  Clearwater National Forest in northern Idaho. The seeds  were cold-stratified before being enclosed in wafers and  spring-planted in May 1974. Planting was done in alter­nating  rows of the two species, with rows two meters  apart and wafers at one-meter intervals. The rows were  oriented perpendicular to the contour on south- and  east-facing slopes on areas that had been site prepared  by broadcast burning the previous fall.  Results  Germination and survival rates through the first grow­ing  season were 39 percent for ponderosa pine and 9  percent for Douglas-fir. These results, when compared  with direct seeding in northern Idaho, were outstanding  and stimulated interest in further work.  Fall planting-1974  (David Adams and Don Hanley)  The study  Following the above success with spring planting, a  fall trial was conducted. Fall planting would avoid the  necessity to stratify the seed, and it was hypothesized  that encapsulization in a wafer containing activated car­bon  would discourage rodent depredation. Wafers con­taining  ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir seed were  planted in October 1974 on the same clearcuts as in the  previous trial. A one-foot grid was used for planting, with  each planting spot marked with a small wood stake.  Results  Rodent depredation was nearly 100 percent within  the first week after planting. On some sites, 85 percent  of the seeds were extracted from the wafers during the  first night. The close planting spacing may have added to  the problem, but, regardless, this experience indicated  that wafers without some kind of repellent or barrier are  vulnerable to rodents.  Field tests of wafer mix and Methocel  product-1978 (luke Powell)  The study  Powell conducted a field test based on growth room  results (page 6). Wafers containing ponderosa pine  Douglas-fir, and western white pine were planted on  three clearcuts located in Latah County, Idaho. Site I was  broadcast burned in the fall of 1978 and planted with  2-0 seedlings and seed wafers in the spring of 1979. The  seed wafers were planted on northeast and southwest  aspects.  Like Site I, Site II was site-prepared by broadcast  burning in the fall of 1978. The following spring,  Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine seed  were aerially seeded by helicopter at the rate of 0.37 kg  per hectare. Douglas-fir seed wafers were planted at the  same time on a northeast-facing aspect.  Site Ill was broadcast burned in the fall of 1978 and  planted the following spring with western white pine,  Douglas-fir, and western redcedar seedlings. White pine  seed wafers were planted on a north-facing aspect.  Wafers and control seeds were planted in early May  1979 on each site and evaluated in early fall 1979. The  wafers and seeds were planted flush with the soil surface  in exposed mineral soil.  Results  Percent germination on all three study sites was very  low. The highest germination was 5.33 percent for  Douglas-fir wafers on Site II and 5.33 percent for untreat­ed  seed on Site I. It should be noted that moisture was  very limited during the 1979 growing season. On Site II  the 2-0 bare root seedlings experienced only 4-percent  survival, and the helicopter seeding on Site I was consid­ered  to be a complete failure.  An interesting observation during the field plantings  was that the wafers were noticeably moist the day after  planting, even though no precipitation occurred. This  points to the wafers' ability to absorb water from the sur­rounding  soil. The wafers also acted as an anti-crustant  on the soi I surface.  An analysis of mortality was conducted on a sub­sample  of seeds and wafers. There was no trend toward  waferized seeds receiving more or less rodent depreda­tion  than untreated seeds.  This field trial was largely inconclusive due to the  atypically dry spring and summer.  Crowsnest Forest Products, Canada-1980  The study  Foresters from Crowsnest Forest Products, a Canadian  firm, expressed interest in seed wafers as a means of  regenerating large areas of cutover land. Crowsnest plant­ed  60,000 seed wafers containing single seeds of lodge­pole  pine, Douglas-fir and white spruce, providing the  first ""operational"" trial. Three areas were planted in  subalpine fir-lodgepole pine timber types on two large  clearcuts. These areas were harvested over a two-year  period (1978-1979} and were site-prepared by slash piling  in windrows. Transects were established in the planted  areas to obtain a sample of germination results.  Seed wafers manufactured in May 1980 at the  University of Idaho were sown on the Canadian sites by  a temporary planting crew. The lodgepole pine and  Douglas-fir wafers were planted within two weeks of  manufacture. The white spruce wafers were exposed to  hot sunlight and were not planted for a month after  delivery.  Results  Mixed germination rates were observed, ranging from  98 percent for a lodgepole pine plot on a moist slope to  almost 0 percent for the spruce. Germination appeared  to be dependent on available soil moisture through the  summer. Seeds in wafers on moist sites germinated well;  those on dry sites fared poorly. The fact that none of the  white spruce seeds germinated could have been due to  the month-long delay in planting and exposure to hot  sun in the rear of a truck.  Weyerhaeuser Corporation-1981  The study  A spot seeding study was established by the Spring­field,  Oregon, district of Weyerhaeuser Corporation in  late February and early March 1981. Two plots were es­tablished.  One plot was on a steep, south aspect, rocky,  low-elevation site. It was logged in 1979 and burned in  the winter of 1980 for site preparation. The other plot  was on a high elevation, gentle slope, easterly aspect  with deep soi ls. It was logged in 1978 and burned twice  within two years.  Treatments, all with Douglas-fir seed, included bare  seed and seed wafers with and without two-inch Vexar  tube mouse barriers, paper shade blocks, and bare seed  coated with Endrin and monastrol green. Each seed spot  was scalped to mineral soil.  Results  Mouse barriers were necessary as protection for  seed, seed wafers and Endrin-coated seed. The barriers  also provided protection from soil ravelling. Even on gen-tie  slopes, spot seeding was not successful without the  barriers.  Shade on harsh sites significantly increased survival,  but had no effect on the more mesic site.  Ease of planting was the most significant advantage  of seed wafers. There were no gains in survival.  Table 1. Results of a 1981 Weyerhaeuser seed wafer,  barrier, and seed coating study.

Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seed  were sown in four treatments near Cascade and Horse­shoe  Bend, Idaho.  Results  3  Germination and first-season survival was higher with  seed wafers (with or without sheltercones} than with bu­ried  bare seed (with or without sheltercones}. Seeds and  seed in wafers under sheltercones germinated earlier  than those without cones. However, as the summer  progressed, some of the seedlings under cones died, ap­parently  from high temperatures.  It was observed in planting that the time to saw  wafers was not significantly less than that required to  plant 2-0 seedlings with a planting bar. A final observa­tion  was that after one year, ponderosa pine seedlings  germinated from seed (bare or encapsulated} sawn in  broadcast-burned soil were noticeably more vigorous  than seedlings growing in unburned areas.

Ponderosa pine  seed were encapsulated in seed wafers, sown in the field,  and covered with 10-inch-long 'kxar tubes. Half of the  wafers contained 123 mg each of sulfur-coated urea at a  6-percent dissolution rate and containing 39.5-percent  nitrogen.  One plot was on the east slope of Red Ridge, near  McCall, Idaho, and the other was on the Clear Creek  Tree Farm near Cascade, Idaho. Each plot contained  wafers with SCU and wafers not containing SCU, with  the two treatments replicated 15 times with ten seeds per  replication. Replications were established in a straightfor­ward,  complete randomized experimental design.  Germination counts and seedling height data were  obtained two, three and five months after sowing.  Results  Sulfur-coated urea in the seed wafer mix had little ef­fect  on seedling height after seven months of growth.  Germination, likewise, showed little effect from the SCU.  Overall germination rates ranged from 38.2 percent to  50.4 percent on one site and 49.8 percent to 63.2 per­cent  on the other.  Improving field germination of ponderosa  pine and Douglas-fir seed by using seed  wafers and rodent barriers-1984  (Carl Dirks)  The study  Two field studies were conducted on the University  of Idaho Experimental Forest, northeast of Moscow,  Idaho. These studies were intended to build on the ac­cumulated  experience of eight years of study and field  trials to improve the conditions for field germination and  to test two types of rodent barriers. A secondary objec­tive  was to develop an experimental design for seed wa­fer  field plots that would:  a. reduce sources of variation such that significant  differences could be detected with a one-acre study  plot and 1000 sample seed plots;  b. readily lend itself to statistical analysis using the as­sumptions  of a normal probability distribution and  analysis of variance testing procedures; and  c. serve as a standard design for future study plots.  Both field studies were conducted on sites that had  been logged and broadcast burned during the previous  summer and fall.  Field Study-spring 1981  This study was conducted on two 0.4-hectare plots,  one of which was used to test ponderosa pine seed  wafers and the other for Douglas-fir. Each plot was set up  in a Latin square experimental design with 2 x 3 factorial  treatments. Each treatment was replicated six times. The  two sets of variables were:  1. seed treatment variables  a. encapsulated seed (seed wafers)  b. buried bare seed (control)  2. protection variables  a. sheltercones  b. Vexar cones  c. no protection (control)  The treatments were randomly assigned to the ex­perimental  cel ls within the plot. For each cell, 28 seeds  were sown with a uniform spacing. The end result was a  1.3- by 1.3-meter average spacing.  Site preparation on the Douglas-fir plot (fall 1980)  resulted in 50-percent duff reduction and many residual  logs. The site for this plot was classified as a Thuja p/ica­ta  - Pachistima myrsinites habitat type (Daubenmire and  Daubenmire 1968) and was at an elevation of 950  meters. The soils were deep, moderately well-drained silt  loam.  Site preparation (fall 1980) on the ponderosa pine  plot was much hotter than on the Douglas-fir study site,  resulting in almost complete duff removal. The soil was  compacted from tractor yarding.  Elevation was 975 meters, and the habitat type was  Abies grandis - Pachistima myrsinites (Daubenmire and  Daubenmire 1968). The soil type was a silt loam, but  was more shallow than on the Douglas-fir plot.  Weather conditions were very wet at time of sowing,  and soil temperatures averaged four degrees centigrade.  Each wafer was sown in the center of a 30-cm by 30-cm  scalp exposing mineral soil.  Data on the number of live seedlings as well as  seedling height were measured three months and fifteen  months after sowing. Cumulative percent germination  and survival data were calculated as a measure of the  benefit or impact of the seed treatments and protection  treatments. Percent mortality of seedlings was calculated  in order to discover any adverse effects of the protection  treatments on the seedlings after germination.  Results  Ponderosa pine  For ponderosa pine, the treatment combining a seed  wafer with a sheltercone resulted in the best three-month  germination and survival at 61 percent. The other physi­cal  barrier treatments were not significantly poorer. The  treatments resulting in lowest germination were seed  wafers without protection (2%) and bare seed with no  protection (9%) (Fig. 1).  100  ~90  (,)  ~80  ~ ·;.;.:.: 70 0 I  :I ""' 60 .8 )-«&gt;S 15-«&gt;S  ""C ~0  c  ""c' so 46.9  -~ 4) .8  :!! 40  ·~  cu ) 0  (,)  ! 20  ~  rf tn  n  Figure 1. Percent germination and survival for the individual  treatments of ponderosa pine in the 1981 field study.  0.7  Three-month and fifteen-month measurements indi­cated  that treatments with physical barriers had signif­cantly  higher percent germination and survival than treat­ments  without. Seed wafers resulted in better germina­tion  and survival, but not significantly better.  Seedlings germinated from bare seed experienced a  significantly higher death rate (58%) than seedlings from  seed wafers (31%). Likewise, seedlings protected by  sheltercones had greater mortality (54%) than seedlings  protected by Vexar cones (35%). Seedlings not protected  had an intermediate mortality rate (47%).  Seedling height differences, although evident early,  all but disappeared by 15 months of age.  Douglas-fir  As with ponderosa pine, the highest germination and  survival for Douglas-fir occurred with the seed wafer and  sheltercone treatment (59%). Bare seed with no protec­tion  produced the lowest germination and survival (Fig.  2).  Seed wafers produced significantly higher germina­tion  and survival than bare seed. Douglas-fir mortality  rates were similar to those of ponderosa pine, although  differences between treatments were not significant.  Seedlings from seed wafers died at a lower rate than  from bare seed, and those protected by Vexar cones ex­hibited  lower mortality rates than those with sheltercones  or no protection.  Sheltercone-protected seedlings were taller than for  other treatments at 3 months, but by age 15 months,  Vexar-protected seedlings were taller, although not signifi­cantly  taller, than sheltercone seedlings.  100  ~90 ""(,)'  ~80  ~ ·;:; 70 ... :I  ""'~0  0 I  3 -IKlS 15 -tAOS  ""C c  ""c' ~0  ·~  :!! 40 ·e  t ) 0 27.0 27 .1  (,)  c 20 cu  ~  t 10  Figure 2. Percent germination and survival for the individual  treatments of Douglas-fir in the 1981 field study.  Field study-spring 1982 (Carl Dirks)  A 1982 study combined trials of ponderosa pine and  Douglas-fir on the same plot with treatments as in the  1981 study. A random complete block experimental de­sign,  with 2 x 2 x 3 factorial treatments, replaced the  1981 design. The design included 12 blocks or replica­tions  of each treatment. Each block contained one ex­perimental  cell for each treatment, and like the 1981  trial, a 1.3-meter spacing was used between seed spots.  The 0.4-hectare field plot was located on the Univer­sity  of Idaho Experimental Forest at an elevation of 918  meters and was classified as a Thuja plicata-Pachistima  myrsinites habitat type. Soils were deep silt loam, and  the site was on a southwest-facing slope.  Seed was sown during the first week of May 1982 on  saturated soils. Weather conditions were warm and dry at  time of sowing, with soil temperature at 7.2 degrees cen­tigrade.  Two weeks of warm and dry weather followed  seed sowing, causing significant warming and drying of  the topsoil. As was done during the 1981 study, a small  spot was scalped to mineral soil for each seed spot and  seed or wafer pressed into the soil at the center of the  spot.  The same data were collected as for the 1981 field  study.  Results  The ponderosa pine seed wafer treatments did much  better than any other set of treatments. Three-month  results for ponderosa pine seed wafers averaged 48 per­cent,  compared to 3 percent for bare seed. Comparable  values were 7 percent and 1 percent for Douglas-fir. After  5  6  17 months, ponderosa pine seed wafer treatments re­mained  higher in survival (22 %) than bare seed (0.4 %).  The protection treatments for ponderosa pine germi­nation  and survival showed no significant differences af­ter  either three or fifteen months.  The germination and survival results for Douglas-fir  were so low as to make statistical inferences  meaningless.  Mortality rates for ponderosa pine seedlings between  3 and 17 months followed a pattern similar to that of the  1981 study. Seedlings from seed wafers had a significant­ly  lower rate than those from bare seed. Seedlings pro­tected  by Vexar cones also had a significantly lower rate  than those protected by sheltercones.  The few seedlings that germinated from Douglas-fir  seed died at a high rate in all treatments.  After 17 months, the ponderosa pine seedlings pro­tected  by sheltercones were taller by a significant amount  than either Vexar-protected or unprotected seedlings.  Seedlings from bare seed were significantly taller than  seedlings from seed wafers after 15 months.  There were so few Douglas-fir seedlings that height  analysis was difficult.  Physical barrier temperature experiment-1982  (Carl Dirks)  The study  Data collection from the 1981 field study (page 4) in­dicated  a significantly higher level of seedling mortality  under sheltercone treatments. In order to determine if  high temperatures were a possible cause, an experiment  was designed to test the hypothesis that daytime high  temperatures inside the plastic sheltercones would be the  same as the temperatures outside the cone. A sub­objective  was to compare the temperatures inside and  outside the Vexar cones with those of the sheltercones.  In a field plot located in Moscow, Idaho, five shelter­cones  and five Vexar cones were installed on mineral soil  with no shading. Temperature inside and outside each  barrier was measured at soil level, as was that of am­bient,  shaded air. Measurements were repeated for eight  days at mid-afternoon.  Results  Soil-level temperatures inside the sheltercones aver­aged  higher (43.5 degrees centigrade) than outside the  cone (41.0 degrees centigrade). Although the differences  were not significant, seven of eight replications had  higher temperatures inside than outside. Ambient air  temperature averaged only 28.1 degrees centigrade.  The reverse was evident for Vexar cones. Tempera­tures  inside the cones were, on the average, two degrees  centigrade lower than outside.  GREENHOUSE, GROWTH ROOM, AND  ENVIRONMENTAL CHAMBER STUDIES  Wafer size, shape, mix, and compaction used in ini­tial  studies were all borrowed directly from experience  with small vegetable seeds. An early question was  whether this configuration is optimal for conifer seeds.  Even more basic was the stated assumption that the ver­miculite  capsule would prove to be a superior environ­ment  for conifer seed germination. Although many such  questions remain to be answered, information has been  accumulated from several studies which should be help­ful  in guiding future work.  Effects on germination of activated carbon in  ·the wafer mix-1980 (luke Powell)  The study  As used in agriculture, activated carbon was incorpo­rated  in the wafer mix to protect vegetable seeds by ab­sorbing  herbicides, thus improving weed-control  capabilities (Kratky and Warren 1971, Detar 1973). As a  bonus effect, there was a significant trend toward earlier  radicle emergence as the carbon content increased from  0 to 7.5 grams per liter of vermiculite mix (Detar 1973).  Kratky and Warren (1971) felt that germination was en­hanced  by the dark color of the carbon, which suppos­edly  increased the temperature of the microenvironment.  Powell (1980) conducted a growth-room experiment  to determine whether the inclusion of activated carbon  in the wafer mix affects conifer seed germination. Seed  of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and western white pine  were tested. Wafers with and without carbon, and con­trol  seed were sown flush with the surface in soil flats  filled with sterilized sand. The flats were watered every  other day and percent cumulative germination was  recorded. The germination value (Czabator 1962) was  calculated for each treatment and used as the criterion  for comparison. This value is a composite expression of  both speed and completeness.  Results  The inclusion of activated carbon in the mix gave  ponderosa pine seed wafers a significant advantage  (P &lt; 0.01) over seed wafers without activated carbon. The  average germination value of ponderosa pine wafers with  carbon was 1.58, compared to an average of 0.92 for  wafers without carbon. Germination values of Douglas-fir  and white pine wafers showed no significant differences  between wafers made with and without carbon (P&gt;0.05).  The controlled environment of the growth room  provided optimum conditions for seed germination. In  this environment, untreated Douglas-fir and ponderosa  pine control seeds had significantly greater average ger­mination  values than wafers (P&gt;0.10). Results of this  study and the next indicate that under laboratory condi­tions,  wafers inhibited germination in two of the three  species. Germination under field conditions was greater  for wafers than for control seed. The Laboratory Germi­nation  Study- 1982 (below) was also designed to test the  effect of wafers on seed germination.  Effects on germination of the Methocel product  and concentration-1980 (luke Powell)  The study  This experiment tested the Methocel binder and con­centration  that yielded the strongest bond possible with­out  inhibiting germination. The results of this study were  used to guide formulations used in the remainder of the  project (Powell 1980).  Products tested were Methocel A15, Methocel AS,  and Methocel E501• Each was tested at concentrations of  30 g/1, 20 g/1 and 10 g/1. The experimental design was a  2 x 3 x 3 factorial that included the activated carbon  treatments described on page 6.  Results  Significant interactions were found among the differ­ent  factor level combinations. Of particular interest was  the treatment-binder-concentration interaction because it  is the interaction that accounts for all factor level combi­nations.  For example, three white pine seed wafer treat­ments  had significantly higher germination values than  controls.  As the result of these tests the following wafer treat-ments  were selected for use:  ponderosa pine-wafers composed of vermiculite and  carbon bound with Methocel E50 at concentration of  20 g/1;  Douglas-fir-wafers composed of vermiculite and car­bon  bound with Methocel AS at concentration of 10  g/1; and  western white pine-wafers composed of vermiculite  and carbon bound with Methocel AS at a concentra­tion  of 20 g/1.  It should be noted that Douglas-fir controls had sig­nificantly  higher (P&lt;0.01) germination values than all wa­fer  treatments of that species, and germination values of  ponderosa pine revealed no significant differences  (P&gt; 0.01) among untreated control seeds and four wafer  treatments.  Effect of wafers on seed water  imbibition-1980 (luke Powell)  The study  The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the  physiological effects wafers have on germination, particu­larly  water imbibition (Powell 1980). Western white pine,  ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir were the species tested.  1Trademark of Dow Chemical.  7  A repeated measures design in randomized complete  blocks was used with each treatment replicated three  times with 150 seeds per replication. Wafers and control  seeds were planted flush with the soil surface in flats  fi lled with sterilized sand. The flats, located in a growth  room, were watered periodically to keep the sand moist.  Percent moisture content (dry weight basis) of both  waferized and untreated seeds was determined through  destructive sampling. Each day seeds were removed from  each rep I ication of each species. After residual material  was washed away, seeds were blotted dry and weighed.  Seeds were then baked at 107°C for 16 hours and  weighed again.

White pine wafers were composed of vermiculite and  carbon-bound with Methocel AS at g/1.  White pine in seed wafers consistently had higher  moisture contents (percent dry weight) than did control  seeds. However, these differences were not significant  (P&gt; 0.10). Wafers of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir also  had higher rates of water uptake than their respective  controls. These differences became significant for  Douglas-fir 4 days into the experiment. The dip in the  percent moisture content curve for ponderosa pine wafers  at 7 days is most likely due to sampling variation.  Laboratory germination study-1982  (Carl Dirks)  The study  A laboratory germination study was conducted con­currently  with Dirks' 1982 field study (page 5). The pri­mary  objectives were to test the hypotheses that (1) ger­mination  of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir seed in a  controlled environment would not be improved by en­capsulation  in a seed wafer, and (2) that in the absence  of small rodents and birds, protection treatments would  not affect seed germination of the two species.  The study was conducted in an indoor growth room  with controlled lighting. A random complete block de­sign  with treatments identical to the 1982 field study was  used. Seeds and seeds in wafers were sown in shallow  pans holding sterile sand. Sheltercone and Vexar cone  barriers were placed over appropriate bare seed or  wafers. Pans were watered whenever the sand showed  signs of drying below a depth of one centimeter.  The total cumulative number of germinated seed per  cell was counted and recorded beginning with the ninth  day of the experiment. Counting continued for 30 days.  Results  For ponderosa pine, the encapsulated seed germinat­ed  significantly better than dried bare seed. Unprotected  seed also germinated better than either of the two pro­tected  treatments.  For Douglas-fir, there were not any significant differ­ences  in seed treatments. Seed under sheltercones germi­nated  at a significantly lower percentage than seed with  Vexar or no-protection treatments .  Nitrogen fertilization and ectomycorrhizal  inoculation of seedlings through use of seed  wafers-1983 (Donald Zak)  The study  Nitrogen deficiencies are common throughout In land  Northwest coniferous ecosystems, and silvicultural prac­tices  in this region do not promote the maintenance of  viable residual populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The  seed wafer was evaluated as a potential practical method  of in-field N fertilization and ectomycorrhizal inoculation  of seedlings (Zak 1983). Western white pine seedlings  were grown in a controlled environment chamber to de­termine  the effect of Pisolithus tinctorius and sulfur­coated  urea (SCU) on growth and nutrition. SCU with  dissolution rates of 6 percent, 18 percent and 25.7 per­cent  N released in one week were incorporated in seed  wafers. Basidiospores of P. tinctorius were used to pro­vide  inoculation.  Results  Nitrogen fertilization elicited the greatest response in  the growth and nutritional parameters under study. Treat­ments  containing 6 percent SCU produced the greatest  total biomass, below ground biomass, and foliar N levels.  These responses suggest that the 6 percent SCU treat­ment  closely meets the physiological needs of the  seedlings under the experimental conditions used.  Ectomycorrhizal root tip development was not affect­ed  by inoculation and N fertilization treatments. There­fore,  it appears that residual ectomycorrhizal fungi and P.  tinctorius were equally efficient in the establishment of a  symbiotic root-fungus association. Foliar N levels were  significantly higher in seedlings inoculated with P. tinc­torius.  Similar but nonsignificant trends were also exhibit­ed  in total biomass, below-ground biomass, and foliar  phosphorous. These findings support the hypothesis that  P. tinctorum did produce infection in inoculated  treatments.  Significant treatment effects were not apparent  throughout the four-month data, but significant differ­ences  developed by seven months.  This study established that superior seedlings can be  produced from N-fertilized and -inoculated seed wafers  in the controlled environment.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR FURTHER STUDY  The various informal field trials and more formally  designed experiments with seed wafers lead to the fol­lowing  conclusions and impressions.  1. The concept of a conifer regeneration system  through the use of seed wafers has potential and  merits further study and development.  2. Application of the methodology with ponderosa  pine, a large-seeded species, has been shown to  yield germination and survival rates of approximate­ly  50 percent when applied on mesic sites.  3. Satisfactory germination and survival rates with  ponderosa pine are highly dependent upon protec­tion  from birds and rodents.  4. In the Inland Empire, seed wafers should be sown  as early in the spring as possible for best results.  5. Trials with Douglas-fir have been variable and have  yielded mostly unsati sfactory results.  6. The one Canadian operational application with  lodgepole pine was successful, adding to the evi­dence  that the method is currently most applicable  with larger-seeded species.  7. There has been insufficient experience with species  other than ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir to pro­vide  a basis for recommendation.  8. Seed wafers facilitate handling and planting small  seeds.  Additional study recommendations include:  1. Research and development dealing with other  species,  2. The study of rodent repellents applied in the mix  as an alternative to physical barriers for protection,  3. A systematic set of studies to determine appropriate  application in terms of planting si te, weather condi­tions,  and planting date,  4. Investigation of additional wafer sizes, shapes, and  compaction rates as related to species and planting  requirements,  5. The use of multiple seeds per wafer for small, low  viability seeds,  6. The development of a high-speed automated wafer  machine,  7. The development of a rapid planting system, and  8. An economic study to determine the cost effective­ness  of the use of seed wafers as compared with  other artificial regeneration alternatives.  LITERATURE CITED  Czabator, F.J. 1962.

Meimban Ill  Robert L. Govett  Thomas M. Gorman  leonard R. Johnson  The Wood Energy Program in the College of Forestry,  Wildlife and Range Sciences encompasses projects relat­ed  to the use of wood residuals for energy, collection  and processing of forest residues, and disposal of wood  energy wastes. This paper investigates the use of wood  residues for cogeneration of process steam and electricity  and presents a general and highly simplified discussion  of the characteristics and operations of various topping­cycle  and bottoming-cycle technologies for cogeneration.  It is intended for readers who have a limited background  in the technical aspects of cogeneration technologies. Be­cause  the discussion of the technical aspect of cogenera­tion  technologies is kept to a minimum, readers who  desi re to know more about the technical features of  these technologies may wish to refer to the references  listed at the end of this report.  What is Cogeneration?  Cogeneration may be defined as the simultaneous  but sequential production of processed heat or steam,  and electricity, from a single plant versus the more con­ventional  method of producing these products from sepa­rate  stand-alone plants. The traditional practice is to  produce electricity from a stand-alone power plant and  to produce process heat or steam from another plant (Of­fice  of Technology Assessment 1983). The advantage of  the cogeneration process simultaneously producing both  electricity and process heat or steam in contrast to sepa­rate  stand-alone plants is that the cogeneration process is  more efficient. With cogeneration, less total energy input  is required to produce outputs of electricity and steam or  process heat than would be the sum of the energy re­quirements  needed to produce the same output of elec­tricity  in a stand-alone plant and to produce separately  the same output of process heat or steam in another  stand-alone plant.  A simplified explanation of why the higher level of  energy efficiency is possible with a cogeneration system  may be provided by considering a wood-fueled steam  turbine power plant used to produce electricity. Such a  plant would typically require about 9500 Btus of energy  to produce 1 kWh of electricity. If the plant were burn­ing  dry wood fuel, about 1 pound of wood bark or  about 1.1 to 1.2 pounds of wood would be required to  provide the gross heat of 9500 Btus. However, the  equivalent heat in 1 kWh of electricity would be equal  to only about 3400 Btus of energy. The difference of  about 6000 Btus (or almost two-thirds of the input heat  requirement) is not recovered in the form of electricity or  another type of product output. This loss includes stack  gas heat loss and other conventional heat losses that are  difficult to recover. These ""non-recoverable"" losses repre­sent  only about 10 percent to 20 percent of the total  energy input of 9500 Btus, for a loss of about 1000 to  2000 Btus. In this example, the stack gas heat loss, other  conventional heat loss, and the heat equivalent of the  electricity produced all combined account for only about  half of the energy input. Cogeneration offers an opportu­nity  to utilize much of the remaining half of the energy  input in the form of relatively inexpensive process steam  or heat.  A. Stand-alone Plant versus Cogeneration Plant  A typical stand-alone power plant has a boiler, a  turbine-generator (or turbo-generator), a condenser, and a  cooling tower (Figure 1). The interaction of these pieces  of equipment during electricity generation is as follows:  In a condensing-turbine, stand-alone system, the  steam that flows through the turbine is condensed im­mediately  as the steam leaves the turbine exhaust. In the  condensation process, a powerful vacuum is created as  the volume of the steam is dramatically reduced. Steam  under high pressure is across the turbine from this vacu­um.  The steam flows through the turbine, causing the  turbine shaft to rotate. This mechanical energy is used to  spin an electric generator. The intensity of shaft rotation  of the turbine depends on the pressure drop across the  turbine and the temperature and the volume of steam  flowing through the turbine.  Back-pressure steam leaving the turbine and entering  the condenser has a latent heat of vaporization which is  released in the condenser. The condenser functions as a  heat exchanger, where the latent heat of vaporization  is gained by water which flows through the condenser  as a cooling medium. This heat is then di ssipated from  the water through use of a cooling tower or by other  means. Being a low-temperature energy (about 125° F),  the energy released from the condenser is generally not  used. When the steam is condensed, it changes from  steam to liquid (condensate), and the condensate is then  recirculated to a tank for reuse in the boiler.  The operation of a cogeneration system in a forest  products mill (such as a sawmill) is quite different from  that of a stand-alone power plant. A simple cogeneration  system may not use a condenser to dissipate heat (Figure  2), because a process load, such as the heating of dry  kilns, may act as a condenser. This circumstance would  describe a non-condensing steam turbine cogeneration  Boiler  Steam  Exhaust  steam  Condenser  - u'-  &lt;1&gt;$  cnnl  c~  (1)-  ""0E c nl  0&lt;1&gt; Uu;  Shaft power  Generator  Cooling  water  pump  Electricity  Cooling  tower  Cooling water  Figure 1.

In such a case, the latent heat  of vaporization of the steam is used to dry lumber. In a  sawmill, process steam used mainly for lumber drying as  well as space heating may be considered as the primary  output of the cogeneration system, with generation of  electricit { as a secondary output. Since the process  steam demands of lumber drying control the steam flow  through the turbine, electrical output is affected by the  process steam demand for lumber drying. Consequently,  the electricity production component of the system may  not operate at capacity.  To minimize the impact of this constraint, an extrac­tion  steam turbine or condensing steam turbine can be  used (Figure 3). With a condensing steam turbine, the la­tent  heat of vaporization of the steam can be condensed  in a condenser or used in a process steam load such as  lumber dry kilns. Process steam at the desired pressure  (usually reduced pressure) and temperature is extracted  directly from the turbine, while the rest of the steam  flows through the turbine and then into the condenser.  Work that is ultimately recovered in the form of generat­ed  electrical power is performed in the turbine both be-fore  and after the extraction of process steam. During  conditions of low process steam demand, greater  volumes of steam flow through the turbine and higher  levels of electrical output are achieved. During condi­tions  of high process steam demand, more steam is re­moved  for the process load and less is allowed to flow  all the way through the turbine, resulting in lower levels  of electrical output.  Cogeneration has greater overall fuel efficiency than  stand-alone systems because the latent heat of vaporiza­tion  is used rather than being dissipated as ""waste heat""  in the condenser (Vranizan et al. 1987). Furthermore, the  amount of energy needed to produce electricity and  process steam from separate plants is greater than the  amount of energy required to produce the products from  a cogeneration plant (Whiting and Decker 1985). This  energy efficiency of cogeneration is illustrated in the fol­lowing  example.  With a stand-alone electrical generation plant, the  equivalent of 1 barrel of oil is needed to produce 600  kWh. With a stand-alone steam plant, a low-temperature  industrial-process steam boiler needs an oil-equivalent  energy input of about 2.25 barrels to produce 8500  Shaft power  Boiler Steam ~~ Generator Electricity  Feed  pu  r---__  .Q..).

Condensing steam turbine in a cogeneration system.  3  pounds of process steam. On the other hand, a cogener­ation  plant needs only about 2.75 barrels of oil to pr~  duce 600 kWh of electricity and 8500 pounds of process  steam. Therefore, there would be a saving of Vz barrel of  oil if both electricity and process steam are cogenerated  rather than produced in separate stand-alone plants (Of­fice  of Technology Assessment 1983).  The energy efficiency of cogeneration will not always  justify a cogeneration system as being superior to sepa­rate  stand-alone systems. Additional items which must be  considered in an analysis of a cogeneration opportunity  include the relative value of electricity being generated,  the size, type and nature of the process steam load, and  the risk and returns proJected for a cogeneration system  investment versus other investment alternatives. A  cogeneration system will in many circumstances have a  payback period and rate of return that may be acceptable  to a utility company, yet represent a commitment which  may be unacceptable to a manufacturing company that  could utilize the process steam. Also, the scale of a  cogeneration plant appropriate to a manufacturing com­pany  that could utilize the process steam may be quite  small as a single block of power to be purchased by a  utility. If a cogeneration plant is to be owned and operat­ed  by a manufacturing company whose prior experience  with boiler operation is low-pressure systems for process  steam, a far higher level of technical knowledge and  proficiency may be required in the operation of high­pressure  boilers and steam turbines than may be found  in the existing workforce.  B. Cogeneration Technologies  Cogeneration systems can be broadly classified into  topping-cycle or bottoming-cycle. In a topping-cycle sys­tem,  the steam is used first for electricity production, and  the by-product steam is captured as process steam for  kiln drying, water heating, or space heating and cool ing.  In a bottoming-cycle system, the high temperature steam  is used first for industrial processes such as in steel fur­naces,  glass kilns, or aluminum furnaces, and the by­product  heat is used for electricity production (Butler  1984, Office of Technology Assessment 1983).  1. Topping Cycles  Commercially available topping-cycle cogeneration  systems include steam turbine, open-cycle gas turbine,  closed-cycle gas turbine, combined gas turbine/steam tur­bine,  and diesel engine systems (Hu 1985, Office of  Technology Assessment 1983). These systems may be  sized up to 100-MW capacity, except for diesel engine  systems, which may be sized up to 30-MW capacity (Of­fice  of Technology Assessment 1983). Fuel cell and  Stirling engine systems are emerging technologies, still in  developmental stages for large-scale applications.  a. Steam turbine-Steam tu rbines are the primary sys­tems  for cogenerating electricity and process steam (Of­fice  of Technology Assessment 1983, Technology  Application Laboratory of the Georgia Institute of Tech­nology  Engineering Experiment Station 1984). They can  4  accommodate a wide variety of fuels such as wood,  coal, natural gas, and solid wastes. They can be catego­rized  into non-condensing (Figure 2) or condensing (Fig­ure  3). In a condensing system, a valve is used to extract  process steam from the turbine. Because the steam is  condensed at the exhaust of the turbine, process steam at  required pressure must be extracted before the steam  leaves the exhaust. In the non-condensing system, there  is no extraction valve and process steam comes directly  from the turbine exhaust. The turbine, in producing pow­er,  acts as pressure reducer. Types of steam turbines suita­ble  for industrial cogeneration are presented in Table 1.  Table 1. Types of steam turbines for industrial cogeneration.  Turbine Type  1.

Some factors influence the selection of a condensing  or non-condensing steam turbine. If process steam re­quirements  are more important than electricity, and proc­ess  steam requirements are not highly variable, a  non-condensing turbine system may be appropriate.  Since steam flow is directly related to electricity output,  a normal condition of high steam flow corresponds to  high electricity production and an abnormal condition of  low steam flow would correspond to a low level of elec­tricity  production. The advantage of a non-condensing  system is that it is a simplified system that does not need  the condenser and cooling tower required for a condens­ing  turbine system and, therefore, should have lower in­-...  estment and maintenance costs. The disadvantage of  non-condensing turbines is that the system cannot ac­commodate  variable electrical load and process steam  demands, and, consequently, is less flexible than a con­densing  turbine system. This disadvantage would be least  important where process steam demands are reasonably  steady and are set at a level near the capacity of the  system.  If variable electrical and process steam demands are  anticipated, a condensing turbine is recommended. In a  condensing turbine, process steam is extracted from the  turbine before it flows all the way through the turbine  and is condensed. Electricity can be generated when  steam flows either to the extraction valve or to the con­denser  (Figure 2). If demands for process steam increase,  larger volumes of process steam are extracted and, as­suming  a constant le1el of steam generated by the boiler,  less steam flows all the way through the turbine. During  periods of no demand for process steam, steam flow can  still be directed through the turbine and to the condens­er.  Consequently, the condensing turbine system is much  more flexible than the non-condensing turbine, because  it provides the opportunity to generate high levels of  electricity where there is little or no demand for process  steam.  In a condensing turbine system, some electricity can  be generated even in a condition where the entire steam  flow is extracted as process steam (100% extraction), but  more electricity can be generated if steam is allowed to  flow all the way through the turbine. Maximum levels of  simultaneous process steam extraction and electrical  power generation are achieved with adequate boiler ca­pacity  to generate the required steam flow. This is graphi­cally  depicted in a steam performance map as shown in  Figure 4. Line A-F-B represents an extreme condition  when all steam is extracted and no steam flows to the  condenser. This corresponds to high process steam de­mand  and relatively low electrical power demand and/or  steam supply limitations. Line A-C represents the other  extreme condition when all steam flows to the condenser  and corresponds to no demand for process steam. The  area bounded by line A-8-E-C represents variable combi­nations  of electricity and steam outputs. Point E  represents a condition where process steam demand is at  a high level and extraction of steam is roughly equivalent  to extraction at Point B, but additional steam flow has  been provided to permit a peak level of electrical power  generation.  Although condensing turbines are more (operational­ly)  flexible than non-condensing turbines, condensing  turbines are limited to larger sizes and are more expen­sive.  It is rare to find condensing turbines smaller than  5-MW capacity because smaller-sized turbines of this  type are difficult to manufacture and operate economi­ca  lly. As previously mentioned, the condensing system  requires a condenser and cooling tower and also requires  a more complicated and typically more expensive  turbine-generator than is required in a non-condensing  system. Consequently, a condensing turbine system is  usually far more expensive than a non-condensing tur­bine  system (Technology Application Laboratory of the  Georgia Institute of Technology Engineering Experiment  Station 1984).  b. Open-cycle gas turbine-Open-cycle gas turbine sys­tems  may be simple (Figure 5) or regenerative (Figure 6).  In both types, air from the atmosphere is compressed,  heated to required turbine inlet temperature in the com-  5  bustion chamber, and then expanded through the tur­bine.  In a regenerative turbine, the low-pressure hot gases  from the turbine are used to preheat the input air (input  air is high-pressure air discharged from the compressor)  in the regenerator. In a simple system, the low-pressure  hot gases from the turbine are not recirculated in the  system.  160  140  120  -~ 100  .Cci5  0  0  0 80 c.  0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000  Kilowatts  Figure 4. Steam performance map (Source: The Technology Ap­plication  Laboratory of the Georgia Institute of Technology En­gineering  Experiment Station 1984).  Open-cycle gas turbines cannot directly burn solid  fuels (such as wood or coal) without first liquefying or  gasifying them. When such gaseous and liquid fuels are  used, they need to be cleaned of impurities because  some products of combustion may damage or corrode  the turbine blades. Since the turbine blades are exposed  to the products of combustion, open-cycle turbines that  burn liquid fuel require about three times more main­tenance  than steam turbines and are generally expected  to last 15 to 25 years in operation.  Poor maintenance, use of liquid fuel, or intermittent  operation can lower the service life of open-cycle gas tur­bines.  Technical and economic constraints currently exist  with design of turbines durable enough to handle wood­derived  gaseous or liquid fuel and/or with the design of  equipment to suitably clean such fuel for use in conven­tional  turbines. This presently restricts the use of wood  fuel in open-cycle gas turbines.  Fuel  Figure 5. Simple open-cycle (Source: Office of Technology As­sessment  1983).  c. Closed-cycle gas turbine-A closed-cycle gas turbine  consists of a compressor, a turbine-generator set, a heat  source (combustion chamber), and a heat exchanger (Fig­ure  7). A working fluid (usually helium or air) is used as  a medium to carry heat from the heat source to the tur­bine  by circulating the fluid into the system. Because it  is a closed-cycle system, virtually any gas could serve as  a working fluid (Office of Technology Assessment 1983).  When the working fluid leaves the turbine exhaust, the  fluid circu lates back to the compressor and then back to  the heat source. Before the working fluid enters the com­pressor,  however, the fluid is cooled; in the process heat  is released. The heat released becomes available for use  as process heat (Hu 1985). In the regenerative system,  the heat from the working fluid leaving the turbine is  used to preheat the working fluid from the compressor.  In a closed-cycle system, both the working fluid and  the turbine are separated from the combustion chamber  (heat source), and thus are separated from the products  of combustion. Therefore, the turbine blades are not sub­jected  to the corrosive impact of combustion products.  Consequently, closed-cycle systems generally require less  maintenance than open-cycle systems. Unlike open-cycle  systems, closed-cycle systems can directly burn solid  No regenerator  Heat source  Water  Figure 6. Regenerative open-cycle (Source: Office of Techno­logy  Assessment 1983.  fuels (such as coal and wood) as well as gaseous fuels  (Office of Technology Assessment 1983).  d. Combined-cycle-In this system (Figure 8), a topping­cycle  and a bottoming-cycle operating at different tem­peratures  are linked together to form a larger intercon­nected  system. The topping-cycle operating at a higher  temperature rejects heat that is recovered and used in a  bottoming-cycle operating at a lower temperature.  In Figure 8, the top portion is a gas turbine topping­cycle,  to which a steam turbine bottoming-cycle is con­nected.  A two-pressure-level heat exchanger (or heat  recovery system) links the two cycles. To improve overall  conversion efficiency and produce additional power, the  heat recovery boiler (in which waste heat of the topping­cycle  is captured) is usually also fired by an external fuel  (Office of Technology Assessment 1983, Hu 1985).  e. Diesel engine-The first diesel engines were designed  for automobiles and propulsion engines. Cogeneration  systems using diesel engines (Figure 9) are topping-cycle  systems. Major components of a typical diesel engine  cogenerator are an engine, a generator, and a heat recov­ery  unit. Since a diesel engine is an internal combustion  engine cooled by water, the heated water can be used  With regenerator  Heat source  Electricity  Figure 7.

It is possible to power a diesel engine and other  types of internal combustion engines with wood fuel by  using a small gasification unit. Such technology was de­veloped  and employed a half-century ago on a limited  basis, but is currently not practical or economically  justifiable except in very limited circumstances.  f. Fuel cell-A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that  converts the chemical energy of a fuel into electricity  with no intermediate combustion cycle (Figure 10). Elec­tricity  and process steam are produced as fol lows.  Hydrogen (the typical fuel) is injected into the anode  (a negatively charged pole) where electrons are freed by  catalytic reaction. This leaves hydrogen ions. The hydro­gen  ions are then conducted (through an electrolyte) to­ward  the cathode (a positively charged pole), where they  combine with oxygen to produce heat and water. Elec­tricity  is generated when electrons and the electrolyte re­act,  while steam is generated when heat and water are  produced. The steam can be used for process steam in a  cogeneration system.  A fuel cell model using phosphoric acid as the elec­trolyte,  uses hydrogen processed (by a device called a  reformer) from hydrocarbon obtained from oi l or gas  wells. Oxygen is extracted directly from the surrounding  air.  The electricity produced by a fuel cell is direct cur­rent,  the type of current used by battery-powered equip­ment.  Since many types of electrical equipment run on  alternating current, an inverter is needed to convert the  direct current into a utility-grade alternating current  (Holusha 1989).  Properties that make fuel cells suitable for industrial  cogeneration are: modular construction, automatic start­up  and shut-down, low pol lutant emissions, and quiet  operation. In addition, individual cells can be assembled  in series to form different voltages, and these assemblies  can be connected in parallel to form different power lev­els  (such as 40 kW to 25 MW) (Office of Technology As­sessment  1983).  The elemental fuel cell model  H2 + 1h02 - H20  H2- 2H+ + 2e  H2  (from fuel)  External load  e  02  (from air)  Figure 10. Fuel cell (Source: Office of Technology Assessment 1983).  8  In their present stage of development, fuel cells are  an expensive technology for producing electricity in large  quantities. Developers estimated that early commercial  models may cost from $1,500 to $2,000 per kW, or about  $22 million for an 11-MW plant. To be competitive with  conventional power plants, the cost must be reduced to  $800 to ~1 ,000 per kW (Holusha 1989).  g. Stirling engine-In a Stirling engine (figure 11), power  that turns a crankshaft IS generated when a gas (such as  hydrogen or helium) entrapped in a piston is alternately  expanded and compressed. In this cycle, a pressure  differential is created. Because the pressure during the  expanding step is much greater than the pressure during  the compression step, power is produced. Stirling en­gines  were originally investigated for automobiles and  development was focused on smaller sizes (3 to 100-kW).  Development of larger sizes (1 to 1.5-MW) is still in the  experimental stage.

Stirling engine (Source: Office ofT echnology Assess­ment  1983).  Stirl ing engines have potential applications in the  residential, commercial, and industrial sectors because of  the fol lowing features.  1. Being an external combustion system, internal  parts are not exposed to corrosive products of combus­tion.  This allows the use of many types of fuels, such as  coal and coal-derived fuels, wood, etc.  2. Fuels can be changed without the need of engine  adjustments and operation interruption. Thus no power is  lost nor efficiency lowered.  3. Stirling engines have far greater efficiency than  other available cogeneration systems. Their waste heat is  one of the lowest among cogenerators.  2. Bottoming Cycles  Bottoming-cycle systems first extract process heat  (usually in the form of high-pressure-temperature process  steam) and then use the steam exhausted (e.g., from an  9  industrial process) to generate electricity. The following  conditions favor the use of a bottoming-cycle cogenera­tion  system: high-temperature exhaust steam, continuous  operation (or a high load factor), high in-plant need of  electric or shaft power, and exhaust steam free of corro­sive  materials. A bottoming-cycle system is most applica­ble  in industries such as metallurgical (aluminum,  copper, and steel), graphite, nonmetallic (cement and  glass), and intermediate and finished metallurgical  processes (forging and casting).  Bottoming-cycle cogeneration technologies include:  steam turbine (applicable for large, high-temperature, and  continuous operations), gas turbine (applicable for high­temperature  and a wide-range-of-power-output uses), and  Rankine-cycle turbine (applicable for small and low­temperature  uses). The steam turbine used in bottoming­cycle  is smaller than the steam turbine used in  combined-cycle because in bottoming-cycle the available  quantity of waste heat is limited.  a. Steam Rankine-cycle-Rankine-cycle bottoming sys­tems  can be a steam or organic cycle. In a steam  Rankine cycle (Figure 12), steam from a heat recovery  boiler is used to drive a steam turbine which generates  electricity and high- and low-temperature waste heat. The  high-temperature waste heat is diverted for process use  or fed back to the boiler. The low-temperature waste heat  is allowed to escape into the air.  b. Organic Rankine-cycle-In an organic Rankine cycle  (Figure 13), an organic fluid (such as toluene) is evaporat­ed  at high pressure, and the vapor is expanded into a  turbine to produce mechanical energy. The vapor is later  recondensed for process use or reinjected into the heat  recovery boiler. Because organic fluids vaporize at a low  temperature, an organic Rankine cycle is suited when  only low-temperature heat sources (200 - 600° F) are  available. The ability of Rankine cycles to use low­temperature  heat allows them to use many forms of ener­gy,  such as solar, geothermal, hot engine, and industrial  waste heat.  3. Wood-fired Cogeneration Technologies  Other features of the topping-cycle and bottoming­cycle  cogeneration technologies presented are shown in  Table 2. Of the cogeneration technologies presented,  only the steam-turbine, closed-cycle gas turbine, and  Stirling engine can be fired directly with wood fuel.  Closed-cycle gas turbines are not commercially available  in the U.S., but are widely used in Europe (Office of  Technology Assessment 1983). Open-cycle gas turbines,  combined gas turbine/steam turbines, and diesel systems  (all are topping cycles) can accept only clean wood-fuel­derived  gases and liquids. Although wood-fired boiler  technologies allow the electricity generating capacity of  wood-fi red cogeneration systems of up to 100 to  150-MW, the availability of wood fuel and its transporta­tion  costs may limit the maximum practical commercial  capacity to 50-MW or less (Resources Agency of Califor­nia  1981).

Le Service  des Eaux et Forêts du Mali est confronté au  problème de mobilisation et participation villageoises  aux activités forestières. Cette mobilisation est un  des objectifs fondamentaux du Plan National de  Lutte contre la Sécheresse et l'Avancée du Désert  et du Plan National de Développement. Pour  atteindre ce but, l'introduction de techniques  appropriées de vulgarisation et de sensibilisation est  nécessaire pour motiver les villageois et les amener  à entreprendre des activités forestières.  Ce rapport a été examiné par le Département des  Ressources Forestières de l'Université d' Idaho et  classé sous le numéro 535, une publication interne  de la station expérimentale et sylvopastorale de  l'U Diversité.  OBJECTIF  Cette étude avait pour but de: 1) recueillir  l'opinion des agents des Eaux et Forêts du Mali sur  les techniques de vulgarisation, d'animation et de  participation utilisées; 2) identifier les raisons pour  lesquelles les villageois sont ou ne sont pas associés  à la gestion de leurs forêts et; 3) déterminer les  voies et moyens pour les conscientiser et les  encourager à entreprendre des activités nécessaires  à la satisfaction de leurs besoins en produits  forestiers tout en maintenant un équilibre écologique  favorable pour les générations futures.  TO C!Rr'ULATE SEE  LIBRARit\N THIS Fl OOR  1  'fi Universityotldaho  UNIVERSITY DF IBAHI LllltARY  LITIERATURE CONSULTEE  La littérature consultée au cours de cette étude  comporte plusieurs écrits et résultats de recherche  effectuée dans les domaines de la mobilisation et de  la participation villageoise aux actions de  développement, de la gestion du personnel, de la  vulgarisation et de la foresterie sociale. Dans ce  rapport, nous allons seulement présenter les points  essentiels de cette littérature qui nous ont servis à  analyser les éléments définis dans notre objectif.  1) Participation Villageoise  La F A.O (1986) a défini la participation comme  étant l'implication des populations locales dans les  prises de décisions qui peuvent influencer leurs  conditions de vie. D'autres auteurs ont mentionné  que les populations doivent en plus, être associés  dans la conduite et l'évaluation des projets de  développement et en être les principaux  bénéficiaires. Force et McLaughlin (1983) et  Drucker (1987) ont noté que la participation des  populations nécessite la concertation, la confiance et  l'éducation entre les preneurs de décisions, les  agents de terrain et les populations intéressées. La  participation nécessite donc un changement  d'attitude de la part des agents qui doivent agir en  agents de développement et non développeurs. En  effet, les agents doivent accepter et reconnaître ce  que les populations rurales connaissent pour mieux  identifier et appréhender les problèmes auxquels  elles font face. Cernea (1985) disait: ""Mettre les  populations au devant de la scène"" dans les projets  de développement signifie leur donner plus  l'occasion de participer de façon effective dans les  activités de planification, et partant leur permettre  de mobiJjser leurs efforts, prendre les décisions qui  s'imposent pour mieux gérer les ressources et  contrôler leurs activités. Todaro (1981) disait qu'en  faisant intéresser les populations dans les prises de  décisions, on participe au développement du bien­être  social et économique de leur communauté.  2) Participation et Gestion du Personnel  En général, le pouvoir de décisions dans les  structures administratives est centralisé et les  décisions sont souvent imposées aux agents  d'exécution. Plusieurs écrits ont fait ressortir la  nécessité d'un dialogue mutuel, direct et franc entre  les responsables et leurs subordonnés qui sont sur  le terrain et qui vivent les réalités villageoises. Une  bureaucratie efficace doit être flexible et ouverte à  une franche collaboration. La concertation entre  supérieurs et techniciens encouragerait l'agent qui  verra ses idées considérées. Les agents de terrain  et leurs supérieurs hiérarchiques doivent apprendre  les uns des autres et apprendre des villageois et vice-  2  versa pour être des agents de développement au  service des populations rurales.  3) Vulgarisation  La vulgarisation des techniques do!t être  considérée comme un échange de connaissances et  une éducation desquels bénéficient l'agent  vulgarisateur d'une part et les villageois encadrés  d'autre part. Cette approche nécessite une  connaissance du monde rural et des besoins des  villageois. Celà aboutirait à une meilleure  élaboration des programmes de foresterie sociale.  Les sessions de vulgarisation et d'animation rurale  sont un moyen pour recueillir des informations et  échanger des idées entre populations et techniciens  pour une mobilisation générale autour des objectifs  assignés. L'objectif fondamental ici est de travailler  avec les populations et non pour elles, et les amener  à prendre des décisions qui peuvent améliorer leurs  conditions de vie. Un bon agent vulgarisateur doit  avoir le talent, l'art, la connaissance et l'expérience  nécessaires pour assister les populations à satisfaire  leurs besoins tout en tenant compte des conditions  sociales, culturelles, économiques et écologiques  dans lesquelles elles vivent.  4) Foresterie Sociale  Toute situation qui implique les populations dans  des activités forestières dont elles sont responsables  et dont elles tirent des bénéfices provenant de leurs  propres efforts est appellée foresterie sociale.  Jordan (1988) a mentionné que les programmes de  foresterie sociale ont pour objectif essentiel d'aider  les familles paysannes à être auto-suffisantes par le  biais de plantations d'arbres dans leur  environnement. Ces programmes doivent être  autocentrés à la base tout en tenant compte des  coutumes et des valeurs sociales et culturelles des  populations (Force et McLaughlin 1983, Falconer  1987 et Jordan 1988).  La foresterie sociale doit bénéficier d'un support  politique permanent, une prise de conscience et  mobilisation générale des populations et  responsables nationaux. Générallement, les  forestiers ont une connaissance technique des arbres  mais savent peu travailler et collaborer avec les  populations (FA. O. 1986). Les associations  traditionnelles, les organisations de masse, les  groupes réligieux, les Organisations Non­Gouvernementales  (O.N.G.) et les écoles pourraient  être des moyens potentiels pour contacter, animer  et mobiliser les populations.  Le problème de propriété, la distribution des  terres et des arbres est un aspect important qui doit  être bien défmi en foresterie sociale. Les agents  forestiers et ceux du développement rural en général  SD12.12U37 no.22  \11\l~ll l~lil~lllt~I\~I~UIIl~~~\\l~ 0 0206 00456380 8  Dagamaissa, Ab/A esultats d'une enqu e  University of ldeho Llbrery  doivent être dotés de moyens logistiques, matériels  d'animation et d'éducation. Ils doivent aussi  bénéficier d'un bon encadrement technique, de  sessions de formation et de recyclage, de salaires  satisfaisants et enfin d'émulations et encouragements  (médailles, citations à l'honneur, etc ... ) pour faciliter  le changement et éviter toute tentation à la police  forestière et à la corruption.  Enfin, des voies et moyens doivent être trouvés  pour mieux combiner les activités de police  forestière à celles de sensibilisation pour amener les  populations à être responsables gestionnaires de  leur environnement.  RESULTATS ET INTERPRETATION  Des 194 questionnaires envoyés, nous avons  éliminé les 17 participants du Cercle de Kati (Région  de Koulikoro) de notre échantillon car au moment  du traitement des données, nous n'avions reçu  aucune réponse du dit Cercle. Finallement, notre  échantillon a été constitué de 177 agents forestiers  dont nous avons reçu des réponses de 104; soit un  taux de participation de 59%.  Opportunités de Participation  L'objectif de cette étude était de déterminer les  techniques employées par les agents des Eaux et  Forêts du Mali pour sensibiliser, motiver et  mobiliser les populations rurales à entreprendre des  actions forestières. Nous avons demandé aux agents  de nous indiquer les techniques qu'ils utilisaient le  plus (les premières et deuxièmes).  Quatre-vingt quatorze pourcent (94%) de nos  répondants ont effectué des missions de  sensibilisation et d'animation dans les villages qu'ils  encadrent. Chaque agent visite 30 villages par an en  moyenne et est responsable d'au moins 50 villages.  Ce résultat montre qu'un agent est responsable de  plus de villages qu'il ne puisse encadrer. Les  répondants ont estimé qu'ils consacrent environ 36%  de leur activités à la sensibilisation, animation et  vulgarisation.  Techniques de Sensibilisation  et de Vulgarisation utilisées  Une liste de douze (12) techniques a été soumise  aux participants à l'enquête en leur demandant  d'indiquer celles qu'ils utilisent toujours,  occasionnellement ou jamais. A chacune de ces  catégories d'utilisation il a été attribué un coefficient  dans l'ordre suivant: toujours (le plus souvent) = 3,  occasionnellement = 2 et jamais = 1. Tableau 1  présente les techniques classées par ordre de  fréquence d'utilisation et la moyenne obtenue pour  chaque technique. Les résultats obtenus peuvent  être expliqués par les changements récemment  3  introduits avec l'application de la Politique  Forestière Nationale du Mali, à savoir celle de  mettre un accent particulier sur la sensibilisation et  l'animation des populations en matière forestière.  Les techniques telles que la radio, les journaux, les  posters, les voyages d'études et les projections de  fùms sont très couteux et ne cadrent pas avec le  niveau actuel de développement du pays.

Nous avons donc jugé utile de  demander aux répondants leur point de vue sur cette  méthode d'animation qui permet aux villageois de  réfléchir sur les problèmes de leur environnement  et de trouver des solutions.  Les résultats montrent que presque 75% de nos  répondants ont reçu une formation de 11 jours en  moyenne sur la méthode GRAAP et plus de 80% de  ceux-ci ont utilisé cette technique pendant leurs  réunions d'animation et de sensibilisation. Les  agents ayant utilisé cette technique ont mentionné  la courte durée de leur formation et le manque de  matériels d'animation comme étant des problèmes  pour méner à bien leur tâche d'animation. Parmi  les 65 agents contactés, 63 (97%) ont évaluéque la  Méthode GRAAP était efficace ou très efficace pour  sensibiliser les villageois. Ils ont estimé que la  technique doit être utilisée au moins trois fois par an  dans un village donné pour mieux motiver les  habitants et les amener à entreprendre des activités  forestières.  Le taux de participation des villageois aux  réunions de sensibilisation avec la méthode GRAAP  est plus élevé que celui de la méthode la plus  utilisée autre que le GRAAP. Un test statistique a  montré que la méthode GRAAP n'est pas utilisée  sur toute l'étendue de la zone étudiée.  Activités forestières  entreprises par les villageois  En général, les agents des Eaux et Forêts du Mali  ont estimé que les techniques d'animation et de  sensibilisation utilisées ont eu un impact sur la  mobilisation des villageois pour l'exécution de  certaines activités forestières. Le taux de  participation des villageois par activité forestière est  donné dans le tableau 3.  Les résultats présentés dans ce tableau sont  encourageants si nous considérons les relations qui  ont préexisté entre villageois et forestiers basées sur  la police forestière. Ceci montre que l'animation et  la sensibilisation sont en train de prévaloir sur la  police forestière au Mali. Une moyenne d'environ  23 villages par agent ont au moins un villageois qui  a été formé en animation et vulgarisation pour aider  l'agent forestier dans sa tâche.  Facteurs pouvant encourager la  participation villageoise  Nous avons donné aux participants une liste de  facteurs qui peuvent encourager les villageois à  participer dans certaines activités forestières et nous  4  leur avons demandé d'emettre un jugement de  valeur sur le dégré d'importance de chaque facteur  pour les villageois. A chaque dégré d'importance  nous avons associé des coefficients allant de ""Pas  important = 1"" à ""Très important = 5"". La moyenne  a été calculée pour chaque facteur comme l'indique  le tableau 4.

Le respect des traditions, de la culture  et de la réligion des villageois par les agents  forestiers, des aides fmancières et matérielles, et  autres émulations ont été mentionnés par plusieurs  participants comme des facteurs pouvant encourager  les villageois à entreprendre des actions forestières.  Contraintes à la Participation Villageoise  L'un des objectifs importants de cette étude était  l'identification de facteurs pouvant limiter les  villageois à entreprendre des activités en matière  forestière. Nous avions prédit que les rapports ayant  existé entre les forestiers et les villageois dans le  passé peuvent entraver une participation effective de  nos populations. Comme nous l'avons  précédemment indiqué dans ce rapport, les agents  consacrent 36% de leur temps à faire de la  sensibilisation. Il est important de noter ici que ce  résultat est supérieur à nos prévisions mais il peut  s'expliquer par la Politique Forestière Nationale.  L'extension de la méthode GRAAP, le travail avec  les écoles et la formation des organisations de  masses existantes en matière de foresterie (foyer  amélioré, pépinières villageoises et scolaires,  plantations et entretien d'arbres, etc ... ) peuvent bien  expliquer ce résultat. Le test statistique Xi2 entre  agents qui utilisent la technique GRAAP et ceux qui  ne l'utilisent pas a montré qu'il n'existe aucune  différence dans le temps consacré à la sensibilisation  et vulgarisation des techniques forestières par les  deux groupes.  Les forestiers maliens sont chargés en même  temps de la sensibilisation des populations et du  contrôle des forêts. Quatre-vingt-dix pourcent  (90%) de nos répondants sont chargés de faire la  police forestière mais plus de la moitié ont affirmé  qu'ils transigent dans moins de 25% des villages  qu'ils visitent. Moins de 15% ont rapporté qu'ils  transigent dans plus de 50% des villages encadrés.  Ces deux résultats sont aussi inférieurs à nos  prévisions. Les résultats d'un test statistique ont  montré que les agents ayant reçu une formation en  GRAAP font moins de police forestière que les  autres. Soixante-deux pourcent ( 62%) des  répondants ont affumé que la police forestière ne  constitue pas une barrière à la participation  villageoise. Ceux-ci ont supporté leur point de vue  en disant que la police forestière est un moyen  d'éducation des populations; mais j'ajouterai qu'elle  doit être normalement effectuée et les villageois  doivent être suffisamment informés.  Nous avons demandé aux agents s'ils avaient des  problèmes de communication avec les villageois  qu'ils encadrent et nous avons trouvé que plus de  90% des agents parlent le dialecte des villageois avec  5  lesquels ils travaillent. Sept pourcent seulement ont  affumé avoir des problèmes de communication.  Nous avons donc conclu que malgré la diversité  ethnique du Mali, le langage ne constitue pas une  barrière qui empêche les forestiers maliens de  transmettre le message aux villageois. Dans notre  questionnaire, nous avons aussi demandé aux agents  de nous donner une estimation du temps qu'ils  consacrent actuellement à certaines de leurs activités  (la liste a été donnée) et le temps qu'ils estiment  devoir être alloué à ces mêmes activités. Le tableau  5 donne les temps estimés et le test statistique utilisé  pour les comparer.  Tableau 5: Comparaison du temps actuellement  consacré et le temps que les agents estiment qu'ils  doivent consacrer pour chaque activité  Activités Temps Temps Significance  consacré à consacrer T-Test  Administration 18,40 13,50 p = 0.000  Délivrance de  permis 10,77 9,47 p = 0.154  Police  forestière 18,80 13,49 p = 0.000  Sensibilisation  et Vulgarisation 35,71 44,09 p = 0.000  Les résultats presentés au tableau 5 montrent que  les agents pensent qu'ils doivent passer plus de  temps à faire de la sensibilisation et de la  vulgarisation et, par contre, moins de temps pour la  police forestière et l'administration. Toutes les  différences sont statistiquement significatives sauf  pour la délivrance des permis. L'expérience sur le  terrain a montré qu'avant de gagner la confiance des  villageois et les amener à entreprendre des activités  forestières, un agent doit passer un certain temps à  les fréquenter en vue de connaître leurs problèmes  et leurs besoins.  Quelques agents ont néanmoins déploré des  mutations les obligeant à abandonner certaines  actions entreprises avec les villageois. Ils affirment  que la plupart de ces actions ne bénéficient pas  d'aucun suivi de la part de leur remplaçants.  D'autres points ont fait l'objet de commentaires de  la part de plusieurs de nos répondants notamment  le manque de moyens logistiques et de dotation en  carburant pour bien mener les missions de  sensibilisation. Plus de 70% des participants pensent  qu'un agent forestier doit rester au moins trois (3)  ans dans un poste pour gagner la confiance des  villageois et au moins cinq (5) ans pour obtenir une  participation effective des populations dans les  activités forestières. Comme pour les facteurs  pouvoir encourager la participation villageoise, nous  avons donné aux participants une liste de facteurs  qu'on estime pouvoir empêcher les villageois à  participer dans les actions du service des Eaux et  Forêts. Nous avons adopté la même méthode de  classification et avons déterminé la moyenne pour  chaque facteur comme l'indique le tableau ci­dessous.  Tableau 6: Facteurs pouvant décourager les  villageois de participer dans des activités forestières  Facteurs Moyenne  Les bénéfices en foresterie ne sont pas  immédiats...................................................... 4,12  Manque d'encadrement technique............ 4,09  Les villageois ne sont pas sûrs de  la propriété des terres................................. 4,08  Mauvaise organisation du village.............. 4,07  Conflits de temps avec les  travaux des champs...................................... 4,03  Les villageois ne voient pas la nécessité.. 4,01  Ils considèrent les forestiers comme des  policiers......................................................... 3,95  Ils n'ont pas d'émulations  (encouragements)........................................ 3,81  La foresterie n'est pas une priorité  pour eux........................................................ 3,68  Le partage des bénéfices n'est pas clair ... 3,66  Les arbres appartiennent à l'Etat............. 3,62  Problème de communication  avec les forestiers......................................... 3,56  Manque de main d'oeuvre ......................... 3,54  Ils doivent payer les plants........................ 3,39  Ils préfèrent les espèces locales................ 3,01  Des differents commentaires des participants,  nous avons été sensibles à ceux qui peuvent  expliquer certaines attitudes: ""Comment voulez-vous  que l'on puisse motiver des villageois à entreprendre  des actions forestières si nous, les forestiers, ne  sommes pas motivés et mobilisés pour la cause"".  ""Nous ne pourrons jamais obtenir une participation  efficace tant que nous continuons à décider à la  place des villageois que nous considérons incapables  de faire quelque chose parcequ'analphabètes"". Ceci  montre que nous reconnaissons que nous sommes,  pour une part, responsables de cette attitude  négative qu'ont les villageois envers nous.  Foresterie Communautaire et  Nouvelle Politique Forestière  Nous avons demandé à nos participants s'ils  pensent que les ""Ton Villageois"" (organisations  traditionnelles existantes dans les villages) pourraient  6  être utilisés pour mobiliser les villageois et les  amener à entreprendre des activités de foresterie  communautaire ou sociale. Soixante quinze  pour cent (75%) des répondants ont répondu  positivement à cette question. Ils estiment que les  villageois se sentiraient en ce moment responsables  et concernés par leur développement, travaillant  pour eux-mêmes et non pour le service des Eaux et  Forêts et ayant un devoir moral vis-à-vis de leur  ""Ton"". Nous avons conclu qu'avec un dialogue  mutuel, un effort soutenu de sensibilisation et de  vulgarisa~o~ de thèmes techniques adaptés, une  commurucation permanente avec les organisations  traditionnelles et un encadrement technique efficace,  nous pourrons amener les villageois à une prise de  conscience des problèmes de l'environnement. Mais  notons ici que ces efforts seront vains si les agents  du Service des Eaux et Forêts manquent de  motivation et un engagement responsable et soutenu  des dirigeants du pays.  Concernant la nouvelle politique forestière, les  agents ont affrrmé que celle qui existe déja est  suffisamment claire et bien définie mais l'exécution  demande du temps et de l'argent. La meilleure  approche serait d'aller étape par étape en consacrant  beaucoup de temps à l'animation, à la sensibilisation  et à l'éducation des populations et en défmissant  clairement la propriété et la repartition des terres.  Information sur les Répondants  Environ la moitié de nos répondants vivent dans des  Arrondissements dans lesquels ils assument les  responsabilités de Chefs de Postes Forestiers ou  Agents. Cinquante-quatre pourcent (54%) vivent  dans des Chefs lieux de Cercle ou de Région. Les  agents ayant répondu au questionnaire ont vécu en  moyenne 3,71 années dans leurs postes actuels. La  répartition des répondants par niveau de formation  est la suivante: 19% Ingénieurs des Eaux et Forêts  (I.E.F.), 65,5% Techniciens Supérieurs des Eaux et  Forêts (T.S.E.F.) et 15,5% Agents Techniques des  Eaux et Forêts (A.T.E.F.). Les forestiers maliens  doivent bénéficier d'une formation technique de  qualité et d'un enseignement en matière d'animation,  vulgarisation et socio-économie. Les agents ont une  expérience professionnelle d'une moyenne de 11,6  années avec le Service des Eaux et Forêts allant de  5 à 35 ans.  CONCLUSION  Pour réussir nos futures actions d'amenagement des  ressources naturelles au Mali, nous devons orienter  nos efforts vers une formation multidisciplinaire et  continue des agents du développement rural, une  planification de toutes les actions, une sensibilisation,  une éducation et une mobilisation sans cesse de nos  populations. Les agents du monde rural doivent agir  r  1,  en Agents de Développement travaiiJant avec les  populations et non pour elles. Les efforts déjà  menés dans ce domaine par la Direction Nationale  des Eaux et Forêts doivent être continus et soutenus  tout en allant à l'idée que nous devons comprendre  et connaître les populations rurales, notre plus  importante ressource.  REMERCIEMENTS  Nous remercions spéciallement tous les agents des  Eaux et Forêts du Mali pour leur participation à  cette enquête et le personnel du College ofForestry,  Wildlife and Range Sciences de l'Université d'Idaho  pour nous avoir fourni tout l'équipement nécessaire  pour le traitement des données et leur publication.  Nous remercions également la Direction Nationale  des Eaux et Forêts du Mali pour avoir mis à notre  disposition la liste des agents et la Mission de  l'U .SA.I.D .-Mali pour le fmancement de cette étude.

When a sufficiently heated block is cut  into veneer, the veneer will bend over the lathe's knife without splitting.  This leads to improved volume recovery as the greatest conditioning  benefit. Since conditioning adds to the production costs, a site-specific  economic analysis will be necessary to determine profit margins.  This manual is based on selected literature sources. It briefly  addresses the cost/benefit of block conditioning, heat-conditioning  systems, energy demand, target temperatures, and conditioning times.  Cost/benefit of block conditioning  Advantages and disadvantages of block conditioning (Resch 1988) are  given in Table 1. Based on mill studies and industrial observations,  conditioning reportedly increased the volume recovery by 3 to 25  percent. Payback of increased production costs, on the other hand, may  often occur at a less-than-10-percent additional volume recovery,  assuming fixed capital investment (Resch 1988, Steinhagen et al. 1989).  If boiler capacity must be added, payback and return on investment  should be carefully calculated. A rigorous cost/benefit analysis of block  conditioning has not been published.  Penalties of insufficient block conditioning have been studied in two  mills (Steinhagen et al. 1989, Sim et al. 1989). Underheating the blocks!/  by a given amount of time appeared more costly than overheating them.  Maximum economic benefit coincided closely with maximum veneer  recovery (Fig. 1, where ""a"" denotes differences between adjacent data  points as statistically significant at the 0.05 level, using Scheff~'s  method).  2  Table 1. Advantages and disadvantages of block conditioning (Resch 1988).  Advantages  Increased volume of recovered veneer  Increased quality of recovered veneer  from high-quality and frozen blocks  Reduced knife wear  Reduced glue spread  Tighter veneer with finer checks and  reduced nosabar pressure, especially for  thickness above 1/8 inch  Greater tensile strength of veneer  perpendicular to the grain  Reduced power required for peeling  increased production  Reduced drying time with in-line dryers  Decreased spinouts  Disadvantages  Increased spinouts  Fuzzy veneer surface  End-checking of blocks and veneer  Reasons  Thera is lass splitting and breakage in  handling  There is decreased splitting, reduced  degrade from surface roughness  Knots are softened  Paal is smoother  Wood is mora plastic and lass resistant to  fine checking. thus reducing deep splits  Veneer is tighter and fine, checks are  shallower  Softened wood offers less resistance to  pealing  Faster peeling of softer wood  Some heat is stored in wood, and  steamed wood is more permeable  Thoroughly softened wood requires a  lower turning force  Reasons  Main block remains cold despite heat­softened  ends  Blocks are overheated  Blocks are heated in dry steam  -1-  :l  A.  ... !  u::~ zwoo  W..l mm  Q •  zl­ceLL..  1-:l  U)(.)

Figure 1. Cost and benefit of block conditioning as a function of heating time  (Steinhagen et al. 1989).  Heat-Conditioning systems  Blocks are usually heat-conditioned via (a) steaming in drive-in  chambers which is a batch process, or (b) hot-water spraying (deluging)  in drive-in chambers, also a batch process, or (c) feeding through hot  water vats which is a continuous process (Resch 1988). An overview is  given in Table 2.  Steam chambers (a) are relatively inexpensive to build and maintain.  But the condensate from steaming is ""dirty"" and must be handled in  accordance with governmental guidelines on effluent discharge. Also,  the steam must be saturated for conditioning, or blocks will dry and  .r J~ .~r1 ovl  4  check.  In the deluge system (b), the water can be reused in a closed loop.  Blocks may not heat evenly by this method.  Feed-through in hot water (c) will heat submerged blocks evenly.  This method is very capital-intensive initially.  To help achieve temperature uniformity between blocks, the blocks  must be sorted into diameter classes and classes conditioned for various  lengths of time. In addition, doors rather than curtains must be used  with chambers (a and b) to avoid heat leakage. Also, blocks must be  fully submerged in water and the water agitated (c).  Table 2. Methods for block conditioning (Resch 1988).  Process  Method Batch Continuous  Steam sprayed under Aboveground Aboveground  low pressure chambers (drive-in chamber (conveyors)  high pressure vaults)  Spray or deluge with hot water: Aboveground or Aboveground  below 200°F below ground chamber (conveyors)  super heated chambers  mixed with steam  Immersion in water heated by: Submerged, Feed-through  steam coils covered soaking soaking vats,  live steam vat above or  external heat exchanger below ground  Conditioning energy demand  Examples of net energy required to heat green wood (Steinhagen  1977) are given in Table 3. The table values, reflecting unit energy  demand in terms of BTU/CU.FT.x°F, vary strongly with moisture  content: wood low in moisture content (Douglas-fir heartwood, etc.)  demands relatively little unit energy, and wood high in moisture content  (red oak, aspen, etc.) demands much unit energy. Th__a.wing also has an  important effect on unit energy demand.  5  Unit energy demand values must be multiplied by the total volume  input and the total temperature increase over the heating range to  estimate the total net energy demand.  The gross energy demand is the sum of the net energy demand and  energy losses to the surroundings. Losses occur by warming up the  construction, and by leakage, and reach a peak during winter. Losses  may account for 95 percent, and leakage alone for 60 percent, of actual  gross energy consumption (Kuhlmann 1962). This should offer  substantial opportunities for improvement.  Table 3. Net energy required to heat green wood (Steinhagen 1977).

Using the upper-range table values appears economically  beneficial (Resch 1988, Sim et al. 1989).  Hardwood block temperatures suggested for peeling (Fleischer 1959)  are strongly correlated with the wood's specific gravity. For example,  light wood species (basswood, aspen, etc.) peel well at 70°F, but dense  wood species (oak, hickory, etc.) may require 200°F, measured at the  core limit (Fig. 2).  Temperatures recommended for slicing are often 10 to 20""F higher  than for peeling (Lutz 1972).  6  Table 4. Conditioning temperatures suggested for softwood peeler blocks (Resch  1988).

Conditioning temperatures suggested for hardwood peeler blocks  (Fleischer 1959).  8  Conditioning times  Conditioning periods necessary to meet target temperatures  (Steinhagen 1989) are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively, for  nonfrozen and frozen peeler blocks 8 feet long and up to 25 inches in  diameter. The graphs apply to a target core diameter of 5 inches, a  specific gravity of 0.5, and a moisture content of 100 percent. (Specific  gravity and moisture content are used here as a key to the wood species  effect, and data for many wood species may be looked up in the USDA  Wood Handbook 1987). Also, the steam or agitated water bath  temperature must be known or estimated, as well as the block's initial  temperature and its target temperature.  As an example of how to use the heating time graphs, let us make  assumptions as follows: the block under consideration is nonfrozen;  block diameter = 18 inches; the initial temperature of the block (f ioilal)  = 70°F; the target temperature of the block Cfr..J = 140°F; and the  water bath temperature (T~ = 180°F. Then, (fbado - Tr..JI(f_ -  T~ = (l80°F- 140°F)/(180°F -70°F) = 0.36. This value, together  with 18 inches of block diameter, gives a heating time estimate of 25  hours (Fig. 3, dashed line). Adjustments, if necessary, can be made as  follows:  If the target core diameter = 4 inches, add 1 hour to the hours given  by the figure.  If the target core diameter = 6 inches, subtract 1 hour from the  hours given by the figure.  If the specific gravity = 0.3, subtract 5 percent from the hours given  by the figure.  If the specific gravity = 0. 7, add 5 percent to the hours given by the  figure.  If the moisture content = 50 percent, subtract 10 percent from the  hours given by the figure.  If the moisture content = 150 percent, add 10 percent to the hours  given by the figure.  If the water bath is not agitated, add 10 percent to the hours given  by the figure.  If the wood species contains much ray volume (oak, hickory, etc.),  subtract 10 percent from the hours given by the figure.  9  The user may perform linear interpolations between these values to  find the proper adjustment to the hours given by the figure.  The significance of block diameter on heating time should be noted.  For example, if block A has twice the diameter of block B, block A will  require about five times as much heating time as block B, given equal  core diameters. Therefore, small-diameter and large-diameter blocks  should not be conditioned together and for the same number of hours.  00.---------------------------~--~  ~ 40 T bath - Tfinal _  ~ f bath - Tinitial -  15 20 25  BLOCK DIAMETER (inches)  Figure 3. Conditioning time to reach target temperature in a nonfrozen block,  given a specific gravity of 0.5, a moisture content of 100 percent, and a target  core diameter of 5 inches. The dashed line and data point refer to the example  given in the text (Steinhagen 1989).  Let us now reconsider the previous example but assume that the  block is frozen. Then, T balh - T rma1 = 1800F - 140""F = 40""F. This  value, together with the assumed 18 inches of block diameter, gives a  heating time estimate of 42 hours (Fig. 4, dashed line). For frozen  wood, it is not important to know the initial temperature precisely, as  long as it is safely below 32°F.  10  Adjustments, if necessary, can be made as stated for nonfrozen  blocks, with the following exceptions:  If the moisture content = 50 percent, subtract 20 percent from the  hours given by the figure.  If the moisture content = 150 percent, add 20 percent to the hours  given by the figure.  The effect of block diameter on heating time is the same as  mentioned for nonfrozen wood.  Heated blocks cool rapidly during transfer from the conditioning  facility to the lathe, particularly in winter. It is advisable to install, for  process control, an infrared temperature sensor at the lathe so that veneer  temperature can be monitored continuously while the block is peeled  (Resch 1988).

The  principal species involved is A. tridentata, which occurs as a  complex consisting of three subspecies, one form and one addi­tional  variant not yet named. These five taxa are A. triden/ala  tn'denlola, A. triden/ala wyomingensis, A. tridentata vaseyana,  A. tridelltata vaseyana form spici[ormis and A. tridentata ""X.""  TIley are recognizable by morphological characters and also show  important ecological, phenological, cytological and chemical  (chromatograpllic) differences. They have evolved to fit different  habitats within the sagebrush region , and their recognition as  distinct taxa is basic for management of sagebrush-grass ranges.  Differences of management significance among the five taxa  occur in kind of site occupied, reaction to depletion of under­story,  vegetation , livestock preference and times of seasonal  growth development.  Taxonomy of the Artemisia Tridentata Complex in Idaho  A. H. Winward and E. W. Tisdale  INTRODUCTION  The name Artemisia tridentata was first given by  Nuttall (1841) to a collection made by the Lewis and  Clark expedition. Since this time it has un dergone several  revisions (Rydberg 19 16, Hall and Clements 1923, Ward  1953, and Beetle 1960). Classification of this species has  varied both in the number of subdivisions recognized and  in their taxonomic rank.  TIlis taxon in its various forms constitutes the most  abundant and widespread of the woody species of  Artemisia which characterize the extensive sagebrush-grass  vegetation of Idaho and adjacent portions of the Great  Basin and Columbia Plateau. Uncultivated lands presently  or potentially belonging to this vegetation type occupy  This project was fi nanced jointly by funds from the National  Defense Educa tion Act and the University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife  and Range Experiment Station. Housing and transpo rtat ion for  much of the field work was prov ided by the Intermountain Forest  and Range Experiment Station of the U. S. Forest Service.

Most of the data are drawn from a thesis presented by the  senior author in partial fu lfillment of the Ph.D. degree in Range  Resources from the University of Idaho.

Uncerta inties regard ing the taxonomic stat us of the  woody members of the genus Artemisia have resu lted in  considerable confusion regarding the nature and distribu­tion  of the various taxa involved, and have great ly handi­capped  studies of their ecology and response to land  management practices. The present study was undertaken  to clarify some of these taxonomic problems. The A.  tridelllala (big sagebrush) group was chosen for intensive  study due to its great range and abundance and to its  known taxonomic difficulties.  This study encompasses taxonomic units of big  sagebrush as presented by Beetle (1960) and Beetle and  Young (1965). These include: Artemisia tridentata sub­species  tridentata (basin big sagebrush), Artemisia triden­tata  subspecies wyomingensis (Wyoming big sagebrush) ,  Artemisia tridentata subspecies vaseyana (mounta in big  sageb ru sh) and Artemisia tridentata subspecies vaseyana  form spici!ormis (subalpine big sagebrush). An additional  variant not recognized by the above authors has been en­countered  in this study. It will tentatively be referred to  in this ar ticle as ""X"" big sageb ru sh.  STUDY METHODS  Recent classifica tion systems have emphasized the  use of as many attributes of organ isms as possible, and  include morphological, chemical, cytological, ecological  and distributional data. If results of several attributes  substantiate each other , the resulting cla ssificat ion is  UNIVER lTV OF IDAHO LIB R}·  assumed to be more re liable and useful than one ba sed on  on ly one attribute. Informa tion from all the above-men­tioned  criteria was used to substant iate the taxa described  in this paper.  Numerous herbarium specimens or big sagebrush and  related species were collected throughout Idaho and adja·  cent states. It was necessary to become ramil iar with all  species of sagebrush in the region in order to minimize  taxonomic confusion. Morphological characteristics deter­mined  on herbarium mat erial included : leaf length; width  and length·width ratio; length of vege tative shoots and  fl ower sta lks; flowe r head diameter; number of flowers per  head ; flower heads per stalk and average seed weight.  Observations were made in the field regarding the  physiognomy, phenology, behavioral characteristics and  distribution of each taxon. Representative specimens of  all taxa were photographed both in the field and in the  herbarium.  Thin·layer chromatography was used to obtain  separation of fluorescent methanol-soluble compounds  which fo rm specific pat terns for plan ts belonging to  different taxa. One-hair gram samples of persistent (over­wintering)  leaves were crushed and allowed to stand ove r­night  in 6 011 of methanol. The solvent system consisted of  30 parts methanol to 70 parts benzene. Development was  done in a glass tank (Kensco K-4096) with prepared  chromatographic sheets (Eastman Chromagram Sheet 6060)  on which silica-gel was the ab sorbent. Patterns formed by  the separated compounds were observed by placing the  sheets in a darkened room and exposing them to a long­wave  ult ravio let light (3660 Angstroms). Each spot was  recorded by location, fluorescent color and color intensity .  Rz va lues ( Long 196 1) were calculated, and each spot was  ass igned an identi fy ing number. Rz values were determined  from the re lationsh ip:  distance solute moved  distance standard moved  A fie ld method for determining gross fluorescence or leaf  samples was also developed (Winward and Tisdale 1969).  Inflorescence samples for cytological studies were  collected in the fie ld as fl ower heads began to turn yellow.  Collections were cont inued until pollen grain maturity  was evident. The samples were pla ced in a kiIJ ing solut ion  of 95 percent ethyl alcohol, c11loroform and glacial acetic  acid (6 :3:1). The acetocarmine smear technique (Smith  1947) was used to de termine chromosome numbers. In  addit ion, herbarium samples of material used in Ward's  (1953) study of sagebrush were obtained from the Dudley  Herbarium, Stanford University. These samples were  separated morphologically and chromatographically into  intraspecific units. Chromosome numbers previously  determined by Ward for most of these specimens made it  poss ib le to re late chromosome numbers to specific taxa.  Table 1.

This  ratio was consistently lower in Wyoming and basin big  sagebrush than in mountain and subalpine big sagebrush.  Location of flower stalks in relation to vegetative  shoots also showed taxonomic va lue. Wyoming and basin  big sagebrush produced flower stalks which arose through­out  the crown portion of the plant. In niountain and sub­alpine  big sagebrush the flower stalks arose on ly in the  upper crown portions and extended above the foliage.  TIle combination of location of the two types of shoots  and the relative length of each produced distinct growth  forms. Wyoming and basin big sagebrush were uneven­topped,  while mountain and subalpine big sagebrush were  relatively even-topped shrubs. This difference was con­spicuous  in the field.  Number of flowers per head , flower head diameter  and average seed weight showed only limited value in  separating most of the subspecies, but were useful for  distinguishing subalpine big sagebrush from the others.  Number of flower heads based on equal lengths of stalk  proved particularly helpful in this regard.  A polygonal diagram constructed from morphological  cha racteristics of the four taxa listed above is shown in  Fig. I. Mean values for measurements recorded in Table 1  were scaled along the eight axes. The results show rather  distinct patterns for each taxon. Noticeable overlap was  attributed to the relatively great length of flower stalks  in mountain and subalpine big sagebrush and the low  number of flower heads per stalk in the latter.  Phenology  Marked differences in dates and rates of phenologi­cal  development were recorded among the four major  taxa. (See Fig. 2.) Mountain big sagebrush began growth  approximately 2 weeks later and ripened seed at least  2 weeks earlier than Wyoming and basin big sagebrush.  Studies by Marchand et al. (1966), and observa ti ons on  sagebrush taxa transplanted into the Moscow, Idaho area,  have demonstrated the genetic nature of these differences.  Subalpine big sagebrush began growth later and developed  seed earlier than any of the other taxa. Its phenology  obviously is adapted to the higher elevational areas in which  it is found. Mountain big sagebrush showed a similar but  less marked pattern. 0 consistent phenological differences  were found between basin and Wyoming big sagebrush.  Although ""X"" big sagebrush was found at elevations  where basin and Wyoming sagebrush usually occurred,  its flowering period averaged 2 weeks earlier than that of  these two subspecies, and was closer to that of mountain  big sagebrush.  seeds ripe  pollinating  flower heads  ye llowing  flower heads green  fu ll shoot  medium shoot  early shoot  June  I'  I' •  I·  f'  (  /.

Diagram of phenological development in three subspecies and one form of Artemisia tridellfala.  Chromatography  Chromatographic patterns coincided with morpho­logical  characteristics to substantiate the presence of five  taxonomic units of big sagebrush in Idaho (Fig. 3).  Chlorophyll-a consistently moved farther than other com­pounds,  and so provided a standard for location of all  separated compounds. 0 attempt was made to identify  the other compounds involved.  A relatively close relationship of basin and Wyoming  big sagebrush was suggested by the chromatographic  patterns, as was th e grouping of the other three taxa. The  presence of spot No.5 in the pattern of ""X"" big sageb rush  was the most noticeable sign of a relationship between this  taxon and the two subspecies found at lower elevations.  Cytology  Chromosome numbers determined in this study and  those obtained by reclassifying Ward's (I953) material  are shown in Table 2. Wyoming big sagebrush was found  to be telraploid (2n=36) in all cases. Tllis is the first re­ported  chromosome count for this subspecies. Basin big  sagebrush material was both diploid and tetraploid. This  is contra ry to the finding of Taylor et al. (1964), in which  this subspecies was found to be tetraploid only. No  morphological distinctions were found between diploid  and tetraploid plants of basin big sageb ru sh , and chromato­grams  of all diploid and tetraploid samples showed identical  patterns.  4  Mountain big sagebrush was found to be consistently  diploid (2n= 18), as reported by Taylor et al. (I964).  Material of the higher elevat ional form, subalpine big  sagebrush, was both diploid and tetraploid.  Chromosome numbers were determined for only  two samples of ""X"" big sagebrush_ Both were diploid  (2n=18), but more samples are needed to verify this fmd­jng.  The apparent diploid status of this form, along with  its phenological and ch romatographic characteristics,  suggests a close relationship to mountain big sagebrush.  Specimens of big sageb rush with recurved inflo­rescences  were found , especially in the lower elevations of  the species range. The inflorescence branches in these  plants began to curve downward in the late flower or early  seed stage s of development and were quite noticeable in  the field. This apparently is a genetically controlled charac­teristic  found in isolated individuals. Some previous classi­fications  assigned specific or subspecific ranking to such  specimens. Beetle (I 960) grouped them in the form  parishii of subspecies tridelltata. We found this charac­teristic,  usually associated with relatively long slender  branches and leaves, in both basin and Wyoming big sage­brush.  Two of Ward's three samples of this nature proved  to belong to basin big sagebrush (both tet raploid), and one  to Wyoming big sagebrush (chromosome number not  determined). Samples checked by the authors for chromo­some  number included one with a recurved inflorescence.  (a) herbarium sample (b) full shrub  Fig. 10. Artemisia tridelltata (""X"" big sagebrush).  Artemisia tridentata (""X"" big sagebrush)  Chromatographically, cytologically and phenologi­cally  , this variant is closely allied to mountain big  sageb rush. It is found in a zone of moderate precipitation ,  400-500 mm (16-18 inches) annually , where summer  temperatures are higher than those occurring at similar  elevations in other parts of the state. It has an uneven­topped  growth form , which resembles that of basin big  sagebrush (Fig. 10). It is best distinguished from basin big  sagebrush by its shorter and relatively broader leaves,  earlier phenology and creamish-blue fluorescence when  placed in alcohol.  In Idaho, this form has been found only in the  west-central portion of the state , where it occurs at eleva-  12  tions from 760 to 1370 m (2500 to 4500 ft) above sea  level , and merges gradually into mountain big sagebrush.  Limited cytological samp ling indicates it to be diploid  (2n= 18). It shows only moderate increases in density and  cover when associated herbaceous vegetation is disturbed.  Separation in the field of "" X"" big sagebrush from  mountain big sagebrush is not easy in areas where the two  taxa meet. All big sagebrush material collected below  1370 m (4500 ft) elevation in Idaho and fluorescing  creamish-blue in alcohol has been found to belong to the  ""X"" form. This elevational limit may be diffe rent in other  portions of the sagebrush region.  Artemisia tridentata subspecies vaseyana form spiei/armis  (Osterhout) Beetle (suba lpine big sagebrush)  This taxon is distinguished by its large flower heads  and leaves (Fig. 9). It has a smaller number of flower heads  per length of flower stalk and the inflorescence is closer  to a spicate/raceme than to the panicle characteristic of  other members of the big sageb rush group. There are  commonly more than 6 flowers per head, and the stems  frequently layer. Both diploid (2n=18) and tetraploid  (2n=36) plants occur. It is similar to mountain big sage ­brush  in having a flat-topped growth form and in fluoresc­ing  cream ish-blue in alcohol.  Subalpine big sagebrush, as its name implies, is  definitely a high altitude form , and rarely occurs below  2140 m (7000 ft) above sea level. Even at high elevations  it tends to be restricted to more mesic sites, while drier  habitats at the same elevat ion are occupied by mountain  big sageb rush. Like the latter, subalpine big sagebrush  tends to increase in both density and foliage cover when  the associated herbaceous vegetation is depleted.  (b) full shIub  Fig. 9. Artemisia tridelltata subspecies vaseyana form spiciformis.  II  (a) herbarium sample  Artemisia tridentata subspecies vaseyana (Rydberg) Beetle  (mountain big sagebrush)  Mountain big sagebrush is distinguished from the  other two subspecies by its characte ristic flat topped  appearance and early seed maturity. Flower sta lks arise  only at the upper crown portion of the plant and extend  above the foliage (Fig. 8). Leaves tend to be wider in rela­tion  to their length than those of basin big sagebrush, and  are usually widest just below the leaf lobes. Vegetative  shoots in the upper crown are less than half as long as the  nearest flower stalks. Fluorescence in alcohol is creamish­blue,  and the taxon is consiste ntly diploid (2n= 18). This  subspecies is found throughout the upper foothill and  mountain areas of the state, at elevations ranging from  1370 to 2740 m (4500 to 9000 ft) above sea level. It  shows a strong tendency to increase in plant density and  foliage cover in stands where the herbaceous vegetation  has been disturbed.  (a) herbarium sample  (b) full shrub  Fig. 8. Artemisia tridefl!ata subspecies vaseyalla.  10  Artemisia tridelltata subspecies wyomillgensis Beetle  (Wyoming big sagebrush)  Wyoming big sagebrush is a relatively low·growing  subspecies, 45· 100 cm (1 840 inches) in height (Fig. 7).  Flower stalks arise th roughout the crown of the plant,  providing a rounded , irregular top. Its leaves are relatively  short and wide and more deeply lobed than those of other  big sagebrush taxa. TIle leaf margins cu rve ou tward from  the base, forming bell-shaped leaves. The main stem is  often separated into 2 to 3 twisted portions at ground  leveL  Wyoming big sagebrush fluoresces brownish-red in  alcohol and is consistently tetraploid (2n=36). It grows  in relatively shallow soils in the hotter and drier portions  of the sagebrush region, and is common on the lower  slopes of major drainages. In Idaho it is found at elevations  from 700 to 1980 m (2500 to 6500 ft) above sea leveL  This subspecies shows only a moderate tendency to increase  in density with disturbance of the associated vegetation.  It tends to produce more lateral roots in the upper soil  horizons than other big sagebrush taxa. Consequently, it  may compete more with associated herbaceous species  than do other taxa in the big sagebrush group.  (a) herbarium sample  (b) fuil shrub  Fig. 7.

Artemisia tridentata subspecies tridentata Nuttall  (basin big sagebrush)  This subspecies rep resents the tallest form of big  sagebrush (Fig. 6). Mature plants are commonly  120·1 80 cm (4·6 ft) in height , and indi viduals may reach  240 cm or more. Flower sta lks arise throughout the crown  of the plant, providing a rounded , irregular top . Vegetat ive  shoots originat ing in the upper crown portion of the plant  are more than half the length of immediately adjacent  flower stalks. The leaves are relatively long and narrow and  the persistent leaves are shallow-lobed. Leaf margins are  straight, providing a narrow wedge-shaped leaf which is  widest at the lobe tips. The main stem normally remains  trunk·like.  8  Basin big sagebrush fluoresces brownish-red in alcohol  and has both dip loid (2n= 18) and tet raploid (2n=36)  plants. We were not able to separate plants of the two  ploidy levels by chromatographic patterns, morphological  characteristics or ecological distribution. This subspecies  grows in deep, well drained soils of va lley bottoms and  lower foothill regions. In Idaho its range is from 700 to  2140 m (2500 to 7000 ft) above sea level. It shows only  moderate increases in density with disturbance of the  associated vegetation, but may increase great ly in foliage  cover due to enlargement of crowns. Much of the area  once dominated by this subspecies is presently under  cult iva tion.

Taxonomic rank on the basis of a recurved  inflorescence does not seem justified. Discove ry of this  characte r in two subspecies obviates the form ranking'  assigned by Beetle (J 960).  Big sagebrush plants intermediate in morphology  were found in areas where boundaries of two taxa met.  These intermediates presumably represented hybrids and/o r  environmental modifications, and periodically presented  taxonomic problems. These problems were minimized by  concentrating on characteristics of populations and not on  individuals of intermediate form.  TAXONOMIC KEY AND DESCRIPTIONS  Three important features of the big sagebrush group  must be recognized for identification purposes:  I. Leaves from the flowering branches are not  always reliable for taxonomic separation.  2. Leaves of the vegetative shoots are of two  ""types , ephemeral or persistent. Ephemeral  leaves are larger and often irregularly lobed.  They are among the earliest to develop . and  are shed as the season advances. Persisten t  leaves are typically 3-lobed. and over-winter on  all big sagebrush taxa. Differences between  ephemeral and persistent leaves, and leaf  va riation among taxa of big sagebrush are  shown in Fig. 4_  3. Leaf and growth form characte rist ics are most  easily distinguished after plants have flowered.  The following key is designed for separations based  on persisten t leaves only.

Variat ion in patterns of methanol so luable extracts in five big sagebrush taxa.  DISCUSSION  The A. tridentata complex is a difficult one to  resolve taxonomically , and the subdivisions described in  this paper are not necessa rily the only ones which may be  found in Idaho. They are, however, taxa which can be  recognized in the field by their morphology, and show  important ecological, phenological, cytological and chemi­cal  differences.  Our treatment of this group is generally consistent  with that of other in vest igators. It differs from Bee tle's  views mainly in the ecological sta tus of Wyoming big  sagebrush. We found this subspecies confined to the drier  portions of the sagebrush region of the state, characterized  by low precipitation and relatively shallow soils. Beetle  and Young (1965) described A. wyomingensis as inter­mediate  in ecology and distribution between A. vaseyana  and A. tridentata.  Hanks et al. ( 1973) described seven subdivisions of A.  tridentata , based largely on chromatographic sepa rations  and phenology, but these are not established as taxonomic  entities beyond their grouping under the three subspecies  recogn ized in the present study. Much ecotypic variat ion is  likely to occur in a species as widely distributed as A.  tridentata , but unless these races can be shown to be  morphologically distinct they cannot be ass igned tax­onomic  status.  Despite the reluctance of some land managers, it  appears highly desirable to recognize sub speci fic units of  A. tridentata. Morphological differe nces permit separation  of these taxa in the fie ld. Although the critical differences  may appear unclear at times on an individual plant basis,  due to envi ronmental modifica tion or sporadic crossing,  identification of populations is always feasible. Reasons for  recognizing these sub specific units follow:  l. The A. tridentata subunits described have  evolved in response to different environmental  pressures in various parts of the sagebrush  region in Idaho. For this reason, they possess  high indicator value in the areas where they  occur . A much more valuable classifi cation of  sagebrush-grass vegetation can be made by  recognizing the particular taxon of big sage­brush  present rather than lumping all under  the heading of A. tridentata. Dominance or  even the presence of one of these subspecific  taxa of big sagebrush can provide information  regarding climate, soil and other site factors. In  the case of depleted range vegetation , much can  be learned about the potential composition and  productivity of a site from the kind of big  sagebrush that it supports.  14  2. Differences in growth habits and reproduction  among the big sagebrush taxa are evident in  their reaction to disturbance of associated  species. Slight to moderate density increases  were found in basin and Wyoming big sagebrush  when the associated herbaceous vegetation was  depleted , although total foliage cover usually  increased due to greater crown size of indivi­dual  sagebrush plants (Tisdale et al. 1969). On  the other hand , subalpine and especially moun­tain  big sagebrush increased sharply in both  density and crown cover when associated vege­tation  was reduced (Winward 1970). Under  such conditions, these two taxa weTe found  to form stands three to five times more dense  than those of the other big sagebrush taxa.  Subalpine big sagebrush is aided in this respect  by its ability to propagate by layering of  basal branches as well as by seed. Since sage­brush  cover is a major criterion for deter­mining  range condition, it follows that correct  identification of the kind of big sagebrush  present is highly important.  3. Differences in preference among subspecific  units of big sagebrush by both domestic live­stock  and wildlife have been observed (Winward  1970, Hanks et al. 1971 and 1973, Brunner  1972, and Sheehy 1975). This is a factor to be  considered for management of big sageb ru sh  ranges. Grazing systems, schemes for sagebrush  control, and reseeding on big game ranges are  some of the practices in which relative animal  preference values of subunits of big sagebrush  are an important consideration .  4. Differences in phenology of 2 to 5 weeks  exist among the various taxa, with mountain  big sagebrush and its close relatives flowering  and producing seed earlier than basin and  Wyoming big sagebrush. Since effectiveness  of herbicide treatment depends largely on the  stage of development in sagebrush, it is vital to  know which subdivision of the species is being  treated, especially if stands of two different  taxa occur in close proximity. Differences in  degree of susce ptibility to herbicides may  also occur among the various taxa. Differences  in growth development rate may be important  for other management measures also , but to  date the herbicide situation is the best known.  Distribution  Distribution of the subdivisions of big sagebrush in  Idaho is shown in Fig. II , a considerable revision of the  distributional picture presented by Beetle (I960). Wyoming  big sageb rush , unrecognized at the time of Beetle's publica­tion  , is shown as the predominant form over large areas ,  extending into the va lleys as far north as Salmon. Basin  big sagebrush occupies a proportionally smaller area than  shown by Beetle. The other important differe nce is made  in reference to A. vaseyana and related taxa. Mountain  big sagebrush itse lf occurs over a much larger area than  shown by Beetle, while subalpine and ""X"" big sagebrush  occupy distinctive areas.  The areas outlined in Fig. I I are those in which the  various taxa occur in noticeable amounts, but are not  necessa rily dominant throughout the entire area indicated  for each. The large area shown for Wyoming big sagebrush  contains numerous patches of basin big sagebrush too  small to depict on this map. The latter subspecies occurs  throughout this dry area , on sites favored by pockets of  deep . moisture-holding soils or by run-off from adjacen t  4 ')0 _ _ .li::.:  4 20  1150  slopes. The actual extent of these stands of basin big  sagebrush is difficu lt to est imate, but it is probably less  than five percent of the total area shown for Wyoming big  sagebrush. Similarly, mountain and subalpine big sage­brush  occur in numerous openings in the coniferous forest,  but these patches constitute less than half the total area  shown fo r these two taxa.  Big sagebrush "" X"" occupies a dist inctive posit ion  along the western border of th e state and has no t been  found elsewhere in Idaho. It occurs in eastern Oregon  also, but may be restricted to an area within 40 to 50  miles of the Idaho border.  Samples of sagebrush collected fr om higher elevations  in the extreme southeastern portion of the state are pre­sently  being assigned to Artemisia rothrockii (Rothrock  sagebrush) by some authors. Recent work has suggested  that this material does not belong in A. rothrockii, but is  instead a hitherto unrecognized va riant of A. tridentata  (Winward 1975). More work is needed to establish the  status of this va riant.  ssp. wyomingtlnSis  ssp. fridtmlrllo  ssp KlStlyontJ  ssp. KlStlyono form sp'cifrmnis  1130 1110  Fig. 11 .

Outbreaks of Mountain Pine Beetle in Lodgepole Pine Forests--  1945 to 1975  Nicholas L. Crookston, Ronald W. Stark, David L. Adams  ABSTRACT  The locations of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus  ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera:Scolytidae), infestations  in lodgepole pine (Pinus COlllorta Doug!.) fores ts between  1945 and 1975 are mapped. The intervals between infesta­tions  at se lected locations from 19 10 to 1975 were tabu­lated  and found to vary between 6 and 64 years.  INIROOuc:nON  The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae  Hopkins (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), frequently becomes a  pest of considerable economic importance throughout the  range of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.). Historical  records and observations indicate that certain geographic  areas are subject to repeated outbreaks of mountain pine  bee tle and thus possess characte ristics conducive to popu­lation  increase. However, a comprehensive historical analy­sis  that would prove this hypothesis has not previously  been made.  Outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle in lodgepole  pine forests have been reported throughout the western  United States since the early 1900s. The first major  recorded outbreak in the Pacific Northwest occurred in  1908 near Joseph, Oregon, on the Wallowa National Forest  (Burke 1946 , Craighead et a!. 193 1, Dolph undated).  The first reported infestation in the northern Rocky  Mountains ( 1909) occurred in Flathead County, Montana  (Evenden 1944). The Beaverhead National Forest, south­western  Montana , experienced its first reported outbreak  in 191 I on the west side of Big Hole Basin (Evenden and  Gibson 1940). Thorne (1935) cited evidence of infestations  that occurred in the Horse Creek area, Utah, during the  last decade of the 18th century.  Since the 1920s many outbreaks have been recorded .  In terms of reported tree mortality levels, few have had  the Significance of the reinfestation of the Big Hole Basin  region during the late 1920s and the 1930s (Evenden  1925; Evenden and Gibson 1940). In 1940, Gibson (1943)  made a final measurement of the tree mortality on the  Beave rhead National Forest at Battlefield, Montana. His  sample area cove red a dense stand of nearly pure lodgepole  pine of diverse diameters and maturity , and represe nted a  large area varying in elevation from 6900 ft (2 100 m) to  7599 ft (2300 m). He found that 74 percent of the trees  6 inches ( 15 em) and greater in diameter at breast height  (db h) were killed as a direct result of the infestation .  During the I 940s, infestations reportedly occurred  on the Deschutes National Forest , Oregon (Dolph undated),  the Caribou (including two Idaho districts formerly part  of the Cache NF) and Targhee National Forests, Idaho ,  and the Teton and Bridger (now called the Bridger-Teton)  National Forests, Wyoming (Godden 1946).  Records of outbreaks that have occurred since  about 1945 were compiled and are presented on the  enclosed map. Infestat ion boundaries were obtained  from Forest Service aerial detection survey sketch maps  and many ground reconnaissance and biological evaluation  survey report s.  METHODS  Sketch map techniques varied among the four Forest  Service regions included in the mapped area. Generally,  the national forests, Indian reservations and parcels of  state land were observed by Forest Service personnel from  low·flying light aircrart. The inrested lands were indicated  by sketching the boundaries of the infestation on a map  and noting the host species and causal in sect. Questionable  areas were usually visited by ground crews.  We transcribed infestation boundary locations from  the sketch maps to 1:500,000 USDI Geological Survey  state topographic maps. The decade in which the inresta·  tion occurred was recorded by color code. Several  unpublished reports were reviewed and the defined  infestation boundaries were incorporated on the state topo­graphic  maps. The data base for each Forest Service region  is discussed below.  Pacific Northwest Region  The Pacific Northwest Region or the Forest Service  is comprised or Oregon and Washington . The historical  map for these states was compiled from systematic aerial  survey records (1947 to 1975) and rour unpublished  reports (Appendix A).  Northem Region  Only part or the Northern Region - western  Montana, northern Idaho and part or Yellowstone National  Park, Wyoming - is included in the historical map. The  data base for this region is comprised sole ly of written  reports (Appendix A) and recent ( 1972 to 1975) aerial  sketch maps. To supplement these data , an unpublished  map prepared by Tunnock (1966) was used to delineate  areas infested prior to 1945. His map is based on un­published  reports written by members or the now·disband·  ed Bureau or Entomology and Plant Quarantine Labora·  tory, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho (Appendix A).  Intermountain Region  The mapped part or the Intermountain Region  includes southern Idaho, northern Utah and western  Wyoming. The data base includes written reports of infes­tations  detected by ground surveys done berore the mid·  1950s. Data from aerial reconnaissance surveys presented  in unpublished reports were used ror the years 1955 to  1964 (Appendix A). Data ror subsequent years were  obtained rrom aerial survey sketch maps which had been  stored on color microfilm.  Rocky Mountain Region  Only the Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming, was  included in the hi storical map. Data regarding inrestations  on this rorest were provided by personnel or the Forest  Supervisor's Office at Cody, Wyoming, and the Rocky  Mountain Regional Office at Denver, Colorado. The inror·  mation was based on aerial sketch maps that date back to  1968.  Final Preparation  Infestation boundaries were transferred free-hand  rrom the state topographic maps to a I : 1.9 million scale  2  base map for the historical map. The large change in scale  necessitated generalization of boundaries and some  omiss ions. Areas infested at least twice were indicated by  a darkening or the color illust rating the area or inrestation.  Small areas were indicated by point symbols.  Deciding the period of reinfestation o ften became  subjective. An area was classified reinfested when it had  been reported inrested, had a significant drop in tree  mortality rates, and then had a resurgence or beetle  activity.  DISCUSSION  The historical map was drawn from many Sources  or varying scale and detail and thus su bject to the rollow·  ing limitations:  I) Aerial survey data were not always verified on  the ground as to host, location or insect. This problem was  most pronounced in the Cascade Mountains of central  Washington, where the host type may have been western  white pine rather than lodgepole pine.  2) Lodgepole pine grows with ponderosa pine in  many parts of the mapped regions. Since both hosts were  often infested concurrent ly, judgments were made as to  the host type. These decis ions were not always substan·  tiated by consulting type maps, and aerial observers some­times  made conflicting decisions between years.  3) Aerial survey techniques varied among regions and  observers. This variation frequently resulted in a given  marginal infestation being included by one observer,  while it might have been omitted by another. Sometimes  infes tat ions consisting of many scattered groups of killed  trees were mapped as a single infestation by one observer,  while another observer might have mapped each small  group or inrested trees separately.  4) Only major inrestations were recorded during  the early years and the boundaries are suspect, as they  were often established by simply drawing an inclusive  circle around a few known points.  5) Data concerning the intenSity or tree mortality  were not included.  In spite of the inaccuracies and limitations inherent  in the historical map, it does provide specific and use rul  inrormation. The locations or major mountain pine beetIe  infestations in lodgepole pine forests over time are available  at a glance and provide an indication or general hazard  zones to the rorest managers.  The length or time between inrestations varied  considerably from area to area. The recurrence rates of  inrestation at a rew locations in the western United States  Table I.

The infestations seem to have  occurred every 20 to 25 yea rs in the Thompson River  Basin , Montana, and the Targhee National Forest , Idaho.  Epidemic populations have been nearly continuous in  the Uinta Mountains, Utah. There was an interval of more  than 60 years between major in festations in the Blue  Mountains, northeastern Oregon.  The reasons for this variation in intervals between  infestations are unknown; howeve r, controlling factors  may include such stand parameters as average phloem  thickness, age and basal area, and such site factors as  elevation and latitude . Variables intrinsic to the insect  population are also undoubtedly involved.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  The following USDA Forest Service personnel offered  valuable assistance: M.D. McGregor and D.R.

The study was limited to the coniferous tree  portion of the stated habitat types. Primary production  was estimated for the foliage, branchwood, peeled bole,  bark, and roots by the accretion of live and dead biomass  over a time interval.  Tree biomass information is essential to determine  emphasis, pnOrll1es, and direction in research and  management. Production estimates, on the ecosystem  level, are required for comparison and analysis of changes  brought about by man's alternative actions.  METHODS  Stand se lect io n, equation selection,  determination, and productivity determination  steps involved in carrying out the objectives.  Stand Selection  Stand se lection criteria were:  biomass  were the  (A) Location within the western hemlock series  (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968);  (8) Uncut through the measurement period, and in  accord with expected natural secondary succes·  sional trends;  (C) Near or at ""normal stocking"" for complete site  occupancy;  (D) Even-aged and at the point of maximum mean  annual increment, cubic-volume basis, the point  of maximum biomass accumulation;  (E) No abnorcnal mortality and f,ee of e-&lt;eessive  pathological or entomological problems;  (F) A fixed radius sample plot located within (ts  boundaries with a measurement record for all  trees at the beginning and end of a known t ime,  (5-1 1 years).

Normality comparisons were based on  's (1932) tables.  atian Selection  A search of the literature and information from the  nlists engaged in forest biomass studi es provided  ession equations (Table 2) that are considered most  licable to north Idaho. Equations of the form shown  w were sought to predict oven-dry tree component  ghts4 from known diameters and heights of the  iferous tree species usually found within these habitat  es:  re:  Wc = f(dbh, ht)  or  Vc = f(dbh, ht)  Wc = ex Vc x Spg  We :::: tree component oven-dry weight in kilograms  Vc :; tree component volume in cubic meters  dbh = diameter (o.b.) at 1.3 m (4.5 ft) above ground  ht = total height of tree  Spg = mean specific gravity of componen t from pub­lished  sources  C = 1000.0, the weight in kil ograms of 1 m3 of water  e components were defined as:  foliage = the weight of all live need les present.  branch wood = the weight of all branch wood present  including the bark, excl uding any portion of the  main stem.  peeled bole = the weight of the main stem from ground  line to top of tree, excluding the bark.  bark = the weight of the main stem bark from the  ground line to the top of the tree.  roots = the weight of the below·ground portion of the  tree .  t is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the advantages and  'sadvantages of using the normality concept. Exce llent discussions  e found in Nelson and Bennett (1965) and Smith (1965). No  tempt has been made to transform the study data to an ""average  ormal"" value.  omparisons could only be made for the western hemlockl  achistima habitat type because of limited available data.  3  Biomass Determination  T o t al standing tree bi oma ss, determined  independently for each of the study pl ots, was calcu lated  by summing the five component weights for each tree  (1.5 cm dbh and larger), then adding these individual tree  values for the pl ot totals. This determination was made  twice, at Tl , the beginning of the measurement period,  and at T2, the end of the period.  Primary Productivity Determination  Productivity was also determined independently for  each pl ot. Periodic annual productivity was measu red for  the period which bracketed the point at which mean  annual incremen t maximized, in order to estimate the  M A I poi n t. Periodic annual productivity of the  branch wood, peeled bole, bark, and roots was  determined by summing the differences between  beginning and ending biomass for each tree over the  measurement period and dividing by the number of years  in the period. Loss to the tree (Le. bark loss, branchwood  fa ll , and small root turnover) and respiration losses were  not included.  Foliage productivity was handled separately because  of the continual turnover of needle biomass. Periodic  annual foliage productivity was determ ined by averaging  tree fo liage biomass for a given species during the  measurement period and dividing by the average duration  of needle retention for that speciess Annual foliage  productivity was added to the annual productivity of the  remaining components to arrive at total annual produc·  tivity. The procedure can be summari zed as follows to  arrive at the stand periodic annu al producitvity in oven-dry  ki logram s/hec tare/year:  Productivity -  "" - E { (bw2 - bWl ) + (pb2 - pb1 ) + (b2 - b1 ) + (r2 - r 1 ) }/V  i-I 1 iii i ill  +(f2 +ft )/2nl.. ] /A  i i  4Weights are expressed in kilograms/hectare.  5Average yearly needle durations used in this study are as follows:  WWP=3 (Buchanan 1936) ; DF=3 (Mitchell 1974); GF=4, WRC=3  (Sargent 1933); WH: 4, ES=5.

Individual  trcc heights wcre developed from height/dbh curves for  each pl ot.  RESULTS  Standing biomass and net primary productivity were  each estimated as ""total"" and ""above ground."" Because of  questionable applicabil ity of the very diverse sources of  the root equations used, the above-ground estimates are  considered much more reliable.  Total standing biomass ranged from 322,900 to  793,100 kg per hectare with a mean of 495,500 kg per  hectare at T1 (beginn ing of measurement period) and  from 371,600 to 937,500 kg per hectare with a mean of  586,900 kg per hectare at T2 (end of measurcment period)  (Table 3). Note the small change in component  percentage at the beginning and end of the measurement  period (Table 3). The above-ground standing biomass  for each of the study units with corresponding  component percentages is expressed in Table 4.  Periodic an nu al productivity and component  percen tages are shown in Table 5 for total and above  ground estimates, respectively. Total productivities ranged  from 8,313 to 19,935 kg/hectare/year with a mean of  13,403 kg/hectare/year. Above-ground producti vit ies  ranged from 7,658 to 17,437 kg/hectare/year with a mean  of 11,967 kg/hecta re/year.  The young and old (study units 32 and 148,  respec tively) stands used for stand age compari sons had  total standing biomasses and productivities as presented in  Tables 3 and 5. Total standing biomass and productivity  for the young stand was lower than the western  hemlock/pachistima habitat type mean values, while the  over-mature stand had a total standing biomass higher  than the mean habitat value, but with a lower total  prod uctivity. Above-ground estimates resulted in the  same trends as the total estimates (Tables 4 and 5).  DISCUSSION  Component Proportions  Total standing biomass and to tal productivity are  shown separately by the five tree components (Fig. 1).  Comparison of the average percentage shows foliage  accounted for onl y a small portion of the stand weight (3  percent), but fo liage accounted for 36 percent of the  annual production. This di ffe rence is caused by the  re lat ively short life span of the foliage; 1-5 years  depending on the tree species. The other four components  represent standing biomass accumulations over the life of  th e stand. A simi lar foliage relationship is also ind icated  in Fig. 1 for the above-ground stand components.

F=foliage, BW=branchwood, PB=peel  bole, B=bark, and R=roots.  10  nd Age Influence  Major age differences between even-aged stands of  s type have an effect on the component percentages.7  e most striking difference is the root biomass  portion of a young stand as compared to that of  ture and over·mature stands (Fig. 2 and Table 5). Also,  large proportion of foliage biomass (14 percent) in  developing crowns of the young stand is in contrast  the stable crowns of the over·mature stand (3 percent).  Comparison of productions among the three age  oups shows a high proportion of the production is in  Iiage compared to that component's relative ly small  oportion of total biomass. Annual production is lower  the immature and over-mature stands compared to the  atu re stands (Table 5). These comparisons indicate the  ssibility of maximizing mean annual increment on a  eight basis close to the mean annual culmination point,  sed on a cubic-volume basis. These comparisons were  ade on a limited number of observations, and  trapolation beyond these comparisons is not advised .  ecies composition and site index should be kept  iform to insure relevant comparisons.  pecies Composition Influence  Species composition has an influence on biomass and  roductivity. In general, the ""W·plots"" with a very high  roportion of white pine have produced more than the  ther stands (Table 6). In addition, the tree diameter of  erage basal area is much greater for these plots. Dbh  ifference is due to white pine dominance in the  verstory and lack of cedar and hemlock in the  nderstory. Crown competition factor (CCF) (Krajicek et  I. 1961 ) also indicates differences between the ""W·plots""  nd the others. High CCF values (Table 6) for some plots  ay indicate higher tree-to-tree competition and a  stagnated"" stand condition. Other factors such as site  dex, basal area, habitat type, measurement period,8 and  he introduction of white pine blister rust (Cronarlium  ibicola, Fisher) must also be accou nted for in these  omparisons.  Comparisons were made between stands within the western  emlock/ pachistima habitat type only in order to hold constant  any environmental variab les.  The 1925-1935 decade was a period of lower than average growth  or wh ite pine. (Leaphart and Stage 197 1). indicating a conservative  roductivity estimate during this period.  11  Site Quality and Stand Density Influence  Site quality and stand density have an influence on  productivity. Productivity is greater on those sites with  high site index and basal area across the range of habitat  types and species compositions. Multiple linear regression  was used to describe the re lationship between  productivity and the independent variables, site index and  basal area per hectare; correlation coefficient equaled  0.06 (Fig. 3). A multiple coefficient of determination of  0.857 and a standard error of the estim ate of 1.42 M  kg/hectare/year were obtained. The re lationship between  these variables and productivity helps explain the high  productivities obtained on the lOW-plots.""  Habitat Type Influence  When the productivity ranges of the sample stands are  grouped by habitat type they appear as follows:  GFIP  wRe/P  WII/P  10 12 14 16  Periodic Annual Productivity  (M kilograms/ hectare/year)  18  The mean and standard deviations by habitat type are:  GF/P  WRC/P  WHIP  =X = 13.755=2.71  = X = 15.58 5 = 2.74  = X= 9.405= 1.28  expressed as M kg/ hectare/year.  20  The habitat type values obtained are inconsistent with the  widely accepted but unpubli shed production theory about  the types, where WHIP is greater than WRC/P, which is  greater than GFjP. This inconsistency is brought about in  part by variabi lity in site index and basal area within and  between habitat types. Species composition, stand stocking  level, and stand history also affect the re lative habitat type  productivity rankings. Additionally, the warmer  temperatures associated with the grand fir/pachistima  habitat type may be more important than abundant  moisture in the production of biomass. Additonal research  is needed over a more diversified data base in order to  identify the variables infiuencing the biomass production  on these types and to provide a more discrete  classification of hab itats to minimize within-type  variation.

The format is similar to that used by  t and Marks (1971). Limitations of available data  cessitated comparing biomass and productivity for the  ove-ground portion on a stand basis only. The average  mass (421.9 M kg/hectare) and ave rage productivity  .0 M kg/hectare/year) from this study were wi th in the  blished range of values. In a very recent publication,  son (1975) listed an above-ground biomass of 320 (M  /hectare) and prod uctivity of 12.0 (M kg/hectare/year)  r ""temperate forest, cool conifers, montane, valley  ils.""

More valid comparisons should be  possible when other sources of published data become  availabl e, and as further research is conducted in the  western hemlock series.  CONCLUSION  Biomass and productivity of coniferous trees of three  habitat types in northern Idaho were determ ined by  empirical formulas. The es ti mates are usefu l as a standard  for comparing stand-by-stand performance. Such estimates  can also be used as a basis in evaluati ng silvicul tural  alternatives.  Additional research is needed to refine these  estimations with actual productivity measurements on the  diverse northern Rocky Mountain forest types.

Johnson  INTRODUCTION  Biomass from wood fiber can be converted to anum·  ber of usable energy forms: steam. electricity, medium­BTU  gas, fuel oil, and others. Conversion technology exists  in all cases, but is more advanced and less expensive for  some products than for others. The wood fiber needed to  supply these processes is available from under·utilized wood  and bark at wood and paper processing plants, from residue  left in the woods and at landings after logging operations,  and from diseased and dead trees. The principal problem  with greater utilization of these materials is econornic­the  cost of delivering the raw material to a processing  poin t.  Idaho contains over 15 million acres of commercial  timberland (USDA Forest Servo 1973) and supports a  sizeab le wood products industry. The timberland and residue  created from operations on these lands are distributed as  shown in Figure I. Figure I also shows population centers  of Idaho as they relate to timberland. Most timber in  northern Idaho will be located within 50 miles of a popu·  lation center; distances in central Idaho will be greater.  The overview shown here tends to substantiate the state­ment  that average haul distance for commercial timber  harvest in this region is 40 miles (Grantham et al. 1974).  The proximity of forest residues to population centers will  affect not only the cost of delivering the fiber to a user,  but also the energy product produced. If an industrial  steam user is located within a reasonable distance of a  forested region , then the wood can be fired to produce  steam. If not, the wood may have to be burned to pro·  Published with the approval of the Director, Forest, Wildlife and  Range Experiment Station, University of Idaho, Moscow, as Contri­bution  No. 143.

An alternative to the consumption of current stands  of timber or their residuals is growth of wood fiber specifi·  cally for use as an energy source. The concept has been  caUed an energy farm, a fuel plantation, and other similar  names. The process involves cultivation of fast-growing tree  species on a short rotation (harvest every 5 to 15 years).  Form of the tree is not important, since the goal is the  greatest volume of fiber that can be grown per unit of area.  Preliminary estimates of the cost of the fuel show it to be  competitive with conventional fuels. However, the plan ­tations  require large areas of land that must meet certain  suitability criteria.  QUANTITIES OF WOOD RESIDUE  Estimates of quantities of wood residue were obtained  from inventories conducted by the USDA Forest Service  and were abstracted from a report developed for the  Northwest Energy Policy Project (NEPP) (Johnson et al.  1977). Measures of cubic volume were converted to weight  and energy potential at the rates of 25 dry Ib/cu ft and  8500 BTU/d ry lb .  The volume estimates obtained from Forest Service  sources were modified to include tops, limbs, and bark.  The resulting volumes for various categories of residue are  shown in Table I. It is easier to recover residue volume  in some of these categories than in others. For example,  mill wood and mill bark are usually available in consoli·  dated quantities at easily accessible mill sites. The volumes  of annua l mortality , excess annual growth, and existing cull  will be located in the woods and may not be accessible .  Logging residues will be accessible through the logging  roads used in the commercial timber harvest, but will be  widely dispersed.  l  l  The report prepared for the NEPP classified miU  wood, mill bark, and logging residues as realistically collect­able.  The quantities in the other three categories were not  considered collectable at the present time because of the  high costs of complete recovery and the general lack of  access via roads. The three recoverable categories represent  an annual volume of 126 x 10' cu ft or an energy potential  of27 x 10,zBTU.  The quantities presented here rep resent the above­ground  portions of the trees. Inclusion of the stumps and  roots of the trees would add to the amount of forest  residue (Lowe 1973). Logging residue would increase from  61 x 10' cu ft to 80 x 10' cu ft. Although research is  continuing on methods to recover the below-ground por­tions  of trees, they are generally not realistically collectable  now, given Idaho terrain conditions and tree species.  Commercial timberland in Idaho covers 15,192,000  acres (USDA Forest Serv .1973). The logging residue shown  in Table I averages 4 cu ftlacre of commercial timberland.  This is not an indicator of the residue volume per acre on a  single logging site; that volume will be much higher. If  timber harvest operations are distributed uniformly  throughout all commercial timberland, however, 4 ell  ftlacre represents the residue that will be available annually  over the years . At this volume level a SO-MW electrical  generating plant would require 4,390,000 acres of commer­cial  timbe rland annually (Ga rdner and Gibson 1974). This  implies residue delivery from an area of contiguous com­mercia1  timberland in a 47-mi radius. The annual quantities  of forest residue shown in Table I could fuel 3.4 SO-MW  electrical generating facilities in Idaho.  I f the existing cull shown in Table I could be recov­ered,  it would be sufficient to fuel 190 MW of electrical  generation for 20 years. I However, all of this volume will  probably not be recoverable and, because of natural decay  processes, wil l not last the fu ll 20 years.  The energy potential of the wood res idue presented  in Table I represents the higher heating value of the wood .  It cannot be converted to an energy product without some  loss in conversion efficiency. Characteristically, high  moisture content of the wood residue will reduce conver·  sion efficiency in the production of steam to a range of 66  to 70 percent. Conversion efficiency in the generation Of  electricity will range between 27 and 30 percent. At a 66  percent conversion efficiency from wood to steam, the  realistically collectable quantity of residue (mill wood.  mill bark, and logging residue) represents an annual energy  potential of17.7 x lO"" BTU.  I Using a plant load factor of 70% and a thermal (.:onversion effi·  dency for the wood of 27.4%.  2  Mill wood and mill bark are currently being used for a  variety of products, one of which is fuel. An inventory  conducted in 1970 (USDA Forest Servo 1973) showed  30 x 10' cu ft of mill wood and mill bark residues in Idaho  being used for fuel. This represented 15 percent of the total  quantity of mill residues. Paper and fiberboard products  accounted for 47 percent of the mill residues, leaving 38  percent unused. Utilization of mill residues has increased in  the last few years. A survey of sawmills was recently  conducted in the state of Washington (Bergvall et al. 1977).  In 1968 the survey showed 14 percent of the mill wood  residue unused and 32 percent of the mill bark unused  (BergvaU and Gedney 1970). In 1976 these figures had been  reduced to 7 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The  trend is likely to continue, with most utilization taking  place in the forest products industry.  COST OF WOOD RESIDUE  Although availability is decreasing, mill wood and  mill bark residues represent the least expensive form of  wood waste. The price of these residues fluctuates with the  market for their other uses (e.g. , chips for paper and  fiberboa rd production). The 1976 price on the west coast  for various forms of these residues (expressed in equivalent  • Populat ion Center  ~ Forested Area  • ..• .  Figure I.

The price of sawdust  and bark could provide an economic incentive to convert  from facilities using gas or oil to facilities fired by wood.  However, the fuel-equivalent price of wood chips exceeds  current prices of conventional fuels.  One of the deterrents to greater activity in converting  to wood·fired facilities is uncertainty about future demands  for wood and bark residues in the production of traditional  wood products. If the demand for these products rises, as  some projections show, the result wiJI be an increase in the  price of wood residues for fuel or any other use. The  capital cost of a wood·fired system is high , and subsequent  operating costs are higher than with gas or oil systems.  These extra costs must be offset by fuel savings. With an  increase in wood residue prices, this economic incentive for  conversion to wood·fired facilities would be reduced.  Forest residues are a less economical source of fuel  than mill residues because of the cost involved in delivering  them to a processing pOint. Recovery of a non·unifonn  material such as forest residue is accomplished most eco·  nomically when the material is broken down into a uniform  size for long distance tran sportation. Equipment such as  whole tree chippers or portable hammer hogs is available to  accomplish this task, but transportation of such material  still involves transport of a great deal of moisture. Systems  are currently available to compress, compact , and bale chips  and other forest residues. If these systems could be  designed on mobile carriers and moved to locations near the  residue sources, there could be savings in the total cost of  such operations.  There are physical limitations to the areas where  whole tree chippers and the long semi·trailers necessary for  hauling chips can operate. For instance, they may not be  2 I MMBTU = I million BTU.  3  Weight 1 Higher heat value2  (millions dry tons) (tril lions BTU)  .51 8.72  .31 5.32  .76 12.90  1.23 20.90  1.83 31.00  24.50 416 .00  29.10 495.00  able to operate efficiently in steep terrain where landing  space is limited and roads are narrow. Some modification  of existing equipment may be necessary to allow operation  in the steep terrain that is characteristic of much of Idaho.  Costs of residue recovery were estimated in the NEPP  report on the basis of various collection scenarios (Johnson  et al. 1977). An area logged with no attempt at residue  utilization will have to be completely relogged. Costs for  this recovery operation will be higher than if the residues  were recovered as part of the original logging operation or if  all timber in the area were cut and chipped . Costs can  also be reduced if the cost to move the residue to roadside  is borne by the timber harvest as part of a site betterment  requirement. The breakdown of costs for individual  elements of the recovery process is shown in Table 2.  These costs are totaled and presented in Figure 2 as a  function of hauling distance.  MITRE Corporation estimated recovery costs at  $43.00 to $61.00 per dry ton when conventional cable  logging systems were used and the residue was hauled 50  miles (Inman 1977). These estimates are higher than those  of NEPP. A report developed by Stanford Research Insti·  tute listed recovery costs (excluding transportation) at  $10.00 to $17.00 per dry ton (Stanford Res. Inst. 1976).  These estimates are slightly lower than those calculated in  the NEPP report. One conclusion that can be drawn from  this range of collection and delivery costs is that the real  cost of residue coUection is not known with any degree of  ce rtainty.  Recovery of forest residues requires an expenditure  of energy but results in a net energy gain. Hall et a!. (! 976)  estimate the energy expenditure at 5.7 percent of the energy  recovered .  The cost of forest residues in these analyses was  determined as the cost of recovery. No value was assigned  to the residue itself. Since current forest practices call for  the disposal of residues, this is probably a valid assumption.  l  Table 2.

However, there are three areas where unanswered questions  cloud the issue of forest residue utilization . On public  lands, there are the questions of how this operation would  be controlled and administered, and who would pay for the  cost of administration . One possible solution is for the land  managing agency to assume the cost of administration in  return for ti,e benefits of slash disposal.  The second unresolved area relates to ti,e effect of  residue removal on the residual stand. Residues left on a  togging site will return nutrients to the soil , and total  removal of these residues could affect future site produc­tivity.  The effect of certain levels of residue removal on  site productivity and the effect of residual stand damage  incurred in recovery operations are not known with cer­ta  inty. In addition, there are also positive effects of residue  removal: reduction of nre hazard, ease in regenera tion,  etc., and these also must be considered in a complete  analysis of the effects of this problem.  The third area relates to year-round supply of residue.  Since recovery operations will be weather-&lt;lependent, the  question of assuring a continuous supply of material  through storage will also have to be addressed.  Once the forest residues have been delivered to a  process plant, their costs and problems are the same as for  mill residues.  4  CONVERSION COSTS  The two energy products generally discussed in con­junction  with wood residues are process steam and elec­tricity.  Electricity would be produced through the use of  steam-driven turbines. Other conversion processes are  availab le that could convert the wood to a variety of  liquid, solid, or gaseous fuel derivatives. However, conver­sion  to steam or electricity is the most advanced of the  technologies and currently the least costly.  The central feature of either a steam or an electric  plant will be one of several styles of steam boiler in a size  geared to the plant's specific requirements. Additional  equipment will be required to handle the wood chips, to  store an adequate supply of chips, and to control flow of  the chips to the boiler. In some instances a drying facility  will be installed to pre-dry chips to a certain moisture  content. Air quality standards will require emission control  equipment capable of trapping the particulates from  combustion. If electricity is to be the primary product , a  generating facility will be required.  The cost of the boiler will, logically , depend upon  its size, but there is a cost break at about 100,000 lbs of  ~ :::&gt;  ""&gt;- .C. om c ~ o .~  ~:=  45 0:::0  2.50  40  2 .25  35  2 .00  c  0 &gt;- 30 1.75  &gt;.  ~  0 1.50  ~ 25  ""Co .. 1.25 ~  ., 20  ""0 1.00  0 15  .75  10  .50  5 .25  a Retail 1975 coal costs at  1000 mile distance from  mine2  • 1975 Natural gas  cost 2  1975 Oil cost t  •  ~=~'E:===~~~~~ + Comple te relogging3  +  t  tt  o Complete tree har­vest3  100( Residue collection  as part of sawlog  operation.3  t Retail 1975 coal  cos ts at 250 mile  distance fro m mine2  o Subsidized by deliv­ery  costs to landing3  it 1975 coaJ costs for ele.  trical genera ting facilit  (at fac ility site)l  For del ivery costs without profit,  deduct S6.70/dry ton or S.39 MMBTU'  25 50 75  Mil es f rom Processing Point  Figure 2.

It is difficult to detennine an average cost of steam  production because of the variability just noted. However,  using data from the USDA Forest Service (1975), CH2M  Hill (1976) and a Vermont Study (Hall et aI . 1976), typical  costs can be established for two plants, one rated at 60,000  Ib of steam/hour and another at 300,000 Ib of steam/hour.  Analysis performed by CH2M Hill (1976) for a solid  waste plant on the southwest coast of Oregon provides the  basic data for a small plant. Capital cost is set at $5.5  million, with an annual operating cost of $350,000. The  plant yields 394 million Ib of steam/year at a cost of  $2.54/1000 Ib of steam ($1.95/MMBTU).  Data for large plant costs were obtained from  operating costs of a 50·MW generating plant (Hal l et al.  1976) and steam plant capital costs of the USDA Forest  Service (1975). Capital costs of a 3oo,000·lb/ hour plant  were set at S12.5 million dollars' and annual operating costs  at $556,000. The plant will yield 2 billion Ib of steam/year  at a cost of S1.03/1000 Ib ($.79/MMBTU). Costs and energy  requirements of the two plants are summarized in Table 3.  The primary environmental impact resulting from  the combustion of the wood residues will be air emissions.  Emissions are controllable through particulate collectors  and other emission equipment (these also add to the cost of  the system). Wood provides a more environmentally  acceptable fuel than coal, since it does not contain sulfur  (Johnson et al. 1977).  The costs calculated in these two examples should  not be taken as average costs or as truly representative of  what process stearn from wood will cost. Differences in  plant size, the capability of existing facilities, and the  particular equipment combination needed will cause  significant differences in total costs. We can, however,  extend these case studies to determine total energy costs,  including fuel, when using both mill and forest residues,  and to determine residue quantities and acreages that would  be involved in firing steam plants of these sizes.  The small plant would req uire 83,000 green tons/  year of wood residue or .777 x 10"" BTU input per year. At  this rate, current volumes of mill and bark residues could  fire 18 such plants in Idaho. Forest residues could supply  an additional 17 plants' The number of large steam plant  facilities that could be supported by mill residues is 4; tile  number from forest residues is 3.  ) Boiler and other equipments costs were found in C!-I2M Hill to  be about 50% of total cost. They will be a higher percentage and  tolal cost lower if material handling equipment is already available.  4 Sec Table I.  5  Table 3. Cost and energy outpUI of two steam plants.

Mill and bark residues would be available at a price  that fluctuates with other markets for residues. Corder  (1973) set this price at $2.00 to $4.00 per 200-cu ft unit, or  $.I2·$.24/MMBTU. At a 40- mile haul distance, forest  residues were shown to be available at from $1.05 to $1.90/  MMBTU. Using these figu res, the total energy costs for  the two plants can be calculated and are summarized in  Table 4.  Larger plants can produce steam for less than their  smaller counterparts, but eventually this economy of scale  will be lost in the added cost of handling the tremendous  quantities of wood residue required to fire the boilers. The  large plant described here has input requirements equal to a  50·MW electrical generating plant. If all residue were  trucked to the plant in 12·unit chip trucks,S the plant  would need to handle 62 trucks per day, or 6 trucks per  hour on a 10·hour shift. The problems in handling this  much volume per day may place an external limit on plant  size.  Capital cost fo r a wood·fired power plant will also  depend on the type of power plant currently in use and on  the type of industry.

Load factor for both plants was set at 70 percent. The  re sulting power production and costs are outlined in Table  5.  \  Equipment requirements and basic plant configura-tions  are similar for a process steam plant and a wood-fired  electrical generating plant. The total costs in dollars per  BTU for the electrical plant will be higher , however , be­cause  of higher capital costs and lower conversion effi­ciency.  Electrical generating plants enjoy the same economies  of scale as shown for the steam plan t. However. they also  incur the same size limitations imposed on steam plants by  material holding requirements. Grantham et al. (I 974)  indicate that the minimum plant size, economically, is 25  MW and that the maximum size, practically , is 50 MW. Hall  et al. (1976) indicated a 200- to 250-MW maximum, but  performed calculations and analysis on a 50-MW size. Plant  size is usually limited by handling requirements for the  wood residues, by the economical transportation distance  for the residues, or by some combination of these. Eco­nomic  analysis is shown here for two sizes, 50 and 100 MW.  Data for the economic analysis were adapted from pub­lished  reports by the Stanford Research Institute (1976)  and Battelle-Columbus Labs (Hall et a1.1976).  The Battelle study considered a 50-MW plan I for the  state of Vermont and estimated capital costs in year 1975 at  $31 million and annual operating costs at $542 ,000. The  100-MW plant was estimated by Witwer (1976) to cost $52  million and have operating costs of $920,000 per year.  6  Table 5.

Total costs for these plants again depend upon  whether mill or forest residue is used. This is shown in  Figure 3.  The forest residues required to fire 50· and lOO-MW  plants can be matched against average residue quantities per  acre to determine the number of acres required for a plant  and the radius of a circle that will encompass that area  (Table 6).  The greatest potential fo r the use of wood residue in  the production of electricity probably lies in co-generation  with process steam or in co-firing in a coal-fired thermal  plant. Co-generation allows the user to produce both  process steam and electricity. This increases the efficiency  of the process, allows the user to provide both steam and  electricity, and if excess electricity can be sold, provides an  income ince ntive to help pay for the extra cost of equip·  ment. The possibility of co·fi ring wood and coal is a  concept that needs further investigation. A report by  MITRE Corporation states that this ""would enable electric  utilities to burn coal without undergoing the extensive costs  of sulfur oxide emission control equipment"" (lnman 1977).  If this is true, it could provide incentive to use both mill  and forest residues in this manner.  Table 6.

Fuel  plantation costs range from $1.20 to $2.50/MMBTU (Szego  1976). The concept has not yet been field tested, however,  and this testing will be needed to verify these cost est i­mates.  Sites used for fuel plantations must meet criteria  related to precipitation, soil , and terrain. Slope and rainfall  conditions in Idaho generally do not meet the minimum  criteria and, as a result, the potential for fuel plantations is  small .  Studies conducted by two independent organiza tions  identified regions in the United States with potential for  fuel plantations. An acceptable site in the first study  (Szego 1976) required slopes under 25 percent and annual  rainfall of at least 16 inches, preferably 20. Maps showing  general precipitation and terrain were overlayed to identify  acceptable areas . The results for Idaho are shown in Figure  4. Note that the only area determined suitable for a fue l  plantation by these criteria is in some of northern Idaho's  prime agricultural area.  The second study (Inman 1977) caIled for annual  precipitation of at least 25 inches, arable land according to  .

On this basis the entire moun -­tain  region (Idaho, Montana , Wyoming, etc.) was eliminated  from consideration .  The analyses in these two studies were based on large­scale  maps and conditions and did not attempt to consider  special situations within individual states. Although their  general conclusion about the state of Idaho is probably  valjd, there may be specific situ at ions and loca tions that  could be adapted to the fuel plantation concept. The  impact would not be large but might meet U,e needs of a  particular energy demand.  Originally the concept of a fuel plantation was  developed to make use of marginal lands- those not used for  the production of agricultural crops. However, subsequent  analysis has also considered land currently under culti·  vation. If suitable plantation areas are identified in Idaho,  they will probably be areas currently under cultivation.  One issue that will require some research and analysis  concerns the present and future economic tradeoffs of a  shift from food production to production of a biomass fuel.  The criteria developed fo r fuel plantations relate to  annual precipitation , terrain , and land classification of the  site. Precipitation is necessary to support yields of 8 to 10  dry tons per acre per year, which Szego (1976) sta tes is the  minimum yield required to support a fue l plantation.  TIle plantations are designed around short-rotation  crops (5-6 years). According to the MITRE Corporation  report (Inman 1977), the advantages of this concept appear  to be I) higher yields per unit land area and therefore 2)  lower land reqUirements for a given biomass output, 3)  increased labor efficiency through mechanization, and 4)  utilization of the capacity of most short-rota tion tree  species to regenerate by coppicing. Some disadvantages to  this concept mentioned by MITRE include I) higher stand  establishment and management costs than for conventional  forest crops, 2) site limitations, and 3) the danger involved  in working with large monocultures (Howlett and Gamache  1977).  The conceptual design of a fuel plantation as outlined  by the MITRE report includes the following:  I. production of 250,000 dry tons per year,  2. annual productivity per acre in the range of 5 to  13 dry tons,  3. land either purchased or leased ,  4. planting at 4 ft x 4 ft spacing,  5. rotation period of 6 years,  6. irrigation during first 3 years of each rotation,  7. fertilization as needed to maintain product ivity ,  8. weed contro l operations during first year, and  9. 454 mi of work road per farm.

On the basis of these criteria, they determined total  current production costs, delivered to a conversion facility  a maximum of 25 mi from the field, ranging from $1.21  to $2 .47/MMBTU. The literature search conducted for  the NEPP (Johnson et al. 1977) found production costs  when no irrigation was used ranging from $.78 to $1.60/  MMBTU. Irrigation costs were found to range from $.30  to $.81/MMBTU, yielding a total cost under irrigation of  from $1.08 to $2.41/MMBTU.  The MITRE report also itemized production costs on  ten representative sites. A closer look at the costs incurred  on three of these sites might suggest the production cost  range that would be incurred in Idaho (Inman et al. 1977).  The New England site represented an area of low agricul­tural  activity and relatively low productivity,S dry tons per  acre per year. Land cost for this site was set at $260/ acre  and its slopes averaged 15 to 16 percent. The California site  was located on prime agricultural land at a cost of $1400/  acre. It required total irrigation but produced a high yield  of 13 dry tons per acre per year. The lllinois site was  also located on prime agricultural land and represented the  highest land cost, $2860/acre. It did not require irrigation,  but the yield was lower than on the California site, 8 dry  tons per acre per year.  These three sites incurred the highest production  costs of the ten sites selected by MITRE: $l.96/MMBTU  for New England , $2.oo/MMBTU for California , and  $2.47/MMBTU for lllinois. The costs are given in more  detail in Table 7. The high costs reflect in one instance the  result of low site productivity and in the other two the  9  result of high land costs. Since fuel plantation sites selected  for Idaho would either be located on agricultural lands or  be in a low yield category, production costs could be  expected to be in the upper range of those shown.  SUMMARY  Mill residues are currently being used to a great  extent in the production of energy or other products. The  major obstacle to utilization of forest residues is economic.  The cost of collecting the material is high relative to con­ventional  fuels. One method of decreasing collection costs  is to subsidize a fuel recovery operation by the amounts  traditionally going to slash disposal and clean-up. This  would include the amounts allocated to yarding unmer·  chantable material to a landing, piling brush, and burning  brush piles.  Another obstacle to energy use of wood residues,  primarily mill residues, is uncertainty about the continuity  of supply. Predictions about the growing demand for wood  fiber raise valid questions concerning future supplies of  wood residue for energy. Even if economics look favorable,  caution should be used in any long·range program that  includes wood as a major energy source .  Fuel plantations could produce significant quantities  of wood fiber at competitive costs, but they require large  blocks of land that might be needed for food production.  There is little land in Idaho that meets the requirements of  both moisture and gentle terrain.  •  LITERATURE CITED  Bergvall, J .A., D.C. Bolling ton, and L.

When frontal weather associated with typhoons causes heavy  rainfall, surficial landslides frequently occur. resulting in severe property  damage and loss of life. The Korean government has stabilized these  slopes using terraces buttressed by dry masonry walls and drained by  stone-lined cen tral channels. Recommendations for revegetating these  terraces and estimating their effectiveness in reducing groundwater rise  are presented. Suggestions for research projects which would be useful  in identifying areas of high landslide hazard are also given.  An Analysis Of landslide Damage  And Slope Stabilization Near Seoul, Korea  by  George H. Belt and Bo-Myeong Woo  INTRODUCTION  Severe summer storms occur periodically in Korea  as a result of frontal weather associated with typhoons.  Typhoons reaching Korea generally move along a north·  easterly track from the Philippines to Japan. When these  weather systems stall over the mountainous Korean penin·  sula, heavy precipitation usually results. Such a storm  occurred on 8 July 1977, releasing 432 mm of rainfaU  during a 24·hour period . On 9 July an additional 41 mm of  rain fell, making a total of 473 mm for the 48·hour period.  Since annual rainfaU for the region averages 1224 mm, this  single storm represents 38 percent of the average annual  rainfaU. Precipitation intensities on 8 July exceeded 90 mm  per hour during the period from 1900 to 2200 hours. The  magnitude of this rainfall, coupled with the intensity of  delivery, resulted in large numbers of landslides near  Anyang, a suburb of Seoul. The storm took more than 200  lives, injured additional hundreds, and left 60,000 homeless.  Rail and highway systems were disrupted and hundreds of  hectares of rice paddies were inundated or washed away  (Anonymous 19770). Economic losses were estimated to  be in excess of $60,000,000 (Anonymous I 977b).  The 8 July storm was the most severe measured over  a 24·hour period during 250 years of record in the Seoul  area, and the largest since August 1920, when 355.7 mm  of rain was recorded. Storms of lesser magnitude, which  occur more frequently , also cause severe damage . For  Funding for this project was made available through the Agency for  International Development.

ISSN:00734586  example on 19 August 1972, 273 mm of rain resulted in  landslides which killed or injured 480 persons and destroyed  more than 40,000 residences. The recurrent nature of such  severe storms and the loss of life associated with resulting  landslides have led the Korean government to seek assistance  in reducing landslide hazards. Dr. Bo·Myeong Woo of the  Department of Forestry, College of Agriculture at Seoul  National University is directing a research program on the  problem. The following analysis, in support of this program,  is based on a reconnaissance survey of two watersheds  near Anyang and a third drainage within the city limits  of Seoul.  The objectives of this study are to describe the problem  areas, identifying critical factors causing the landslide  hazard, and to suggest measures which might enhance the  effectiveness of stabilization work and future research .  STUDY AREA  Three drainages within 48 km of Seoul were surveyed  in late October of 1977. All involve both urban and agri·  cu!turalland use. The study area and the locations of land·  slides observed are shown in Figure I.  The Samseong-Cheon drainage has historically been a  popular recreation area for the people of Seoul. It was  heavily populated by refugees during the Korean war. Con·  sumption of litter and vegetative cover for fuel has only  partially been ameliorated through reforestation. The  present cover, representative of the previous mixed forest,  consists of Pinus densiflora and oak species. Some intro­duced  species have been planted as part of the reforestation  efforts. The lower portion of this 800-ha drainage is cur­rently  a resort area, while the Department of Forestry at  Seoul National University is developing the upland area as  the Kwanak Arboretum, one of the few protection arbo­retums  in the world .  The soil parent material is a heavily fractured Daebo  granite, a Jurassic intrusion in the biotite·banded gneiss  (Kim and Hong 1975). The soils are rocky-sandy loams  ranging from 20 to 100 cm in depth.

Stream channels are well incised, and evidence of  earlier and continued mass wasting is evident. One of the  more than 40 landslides observed in the drainage is shown  in Figure 2. Terraces, buttressed by dry masonry walls, are  being built to stabilize these slide areas.  Land use in the 930·ha Suam-Cheon drainage is  dominantly agricultural; however, an active quarry and a  hardboard plant are found at the lower end. The dominant  geological formations are augen gneiss and muscovite  schist. These highly fractured formations are overlain by  20 to 100 em of gravelly-sandy loam. Steep slopes range  from 40 to 90 percent. Vegetative cover is well below  natural levels due to heavy use during and after the Korean  war. Evidence of past slope instability is plentiful. A debris  avalanche responsible for the deaths of several people during  the July 1977 storm is shown in Figure 3. Stabilization  efforts such as the rock-lined channels and grade reduction  structures shown in Figure 4 and terraces shown in Figure 5  have been constructed in Ule Suam-Cheon watershed.  The Siheung-Cheon drainage is a densely populated  area of Seoul. Approximately 7.5 ha on the upper slopes  of this drainage were being rehabilitated at the time of the  July 1977 debris avalanche. Failure of the partially stabilized  slopes caused loss of life and severe property damage in the  community below. Terraces supported by dry masonry  buttresses and the single stone-lined drainage channel  built in the area are shown as they appeared in October  1977 (Fig. 6). Note that houses which were immediately  below the rehabilitated area (and obliterated in the slide)  were not rebuilt. However other dwellings remain in the  slide path.  Figure 2.

Large, 7.5-ha slide area on the upper slopes of the Sihueng-Cheon drainage. Dry  masonry buttresses support these terraces.  Soils in this drainage are also derived from granite;  they are coarse· textured and rocky. Due to heavy use and  erosion, incorporated organic matter, surface litter and  vegetation are minimal. The soil depth above parent material  is between 50 and 100 cm. In this drainage visual obser·  vations were limited to the upper slopes and portions of  the channel due to urban development on the lower slopes.  ANALYSIS  Landslides observed in this study result from the  instability of surface soil and rock, not the failure of geo·  logical faults or bedrock. This type of planar slide, commonly  referred to as a debris avalanche, frequently occurs along  with other mass wasting processes such as rotational slumps  and debris flows in the western United States, Japan and  other parts of Asia (Kohno et al. 1968, Bailey 1971,  Gonsior and Gardner 1971, Swanston 1974b, Burroughs  et al. 1976, Megahan et al. 1978). In Korea these slides  have been extensively described on the Ansong-Cheon  watershed near Suwon (Woo 1972) and in the Kwanak·San  area (Woo and Belt 1978). For a detailed review of these  and similar mass wasting processes, the reader is referred  to Woo's article and the several preceding references.  Characteristically, debris avalanches occur on land·  forms having oversteepened slopes and shallow, coarse·  textured soils. Frequently, these slopes have poor drainage  and are underlain by a less permeable layer of parent material  which reduces water movement. The study areas previously  described often have slopes that exceed 60 percent and are  underlain by a compact layer of soil and fractured bedrock.  5  With sandy soils derived from weathered granite , these  areas typify situations where mass wasting hazard is high.  The critical factors under these condHions are the intensity  and duration of rainfall.  High intensity storms which are common during the  rainy season in Korea, trigger mass wasting processes. As  rainfall infiltrates shallow soil surface layers, two major  factors decrease stability of the soil mantle. Cohesion  between soil particles is reduced as water pressure in the  soil pores is increased . At the same time, frictional resistance  to sliding between the mantle and the subsurface layer is  lessened as the lower portion of the mantle becomes satu·  rated. Coarse·textured, cohesionless soils are especially  susceptible to loss of stability because soil particle cohesion  is already small; the buoyant force of water reduces shear  strength rapidly if a saturated layer develops in the lower  portion of the soil mantle. When gravitational forces exceed  the shearing force holding the mantle on the slope, failure  occurs. The resistive force opposing downward movement is  basically a function of the texture and weight of the soil .  mass. n,e additional shearing strength added by roots and  structural irregularities, e.g., benches or imbedded rocks  of the underlying surface, is also important. However, for  situations where steep slopes and shallow soils exist, the key  factor is soil water content. High intensity storms such as  those recorded on 19 August 1972 and 8 July 1977 are  more than sufficient in duration to increase soil water con­ten  t and trigger numerous debris avalanches.  The critical role that rainfall can play in altering slope  stability can be shown by examining the mechanisms in­volved.  Because specific data for the study areas were not  w  ~D  N  The stability relationship can then be expressed in terms of:  C( = the slope (degrees)  W the weight of the soil volume (kg)  o the force exerted by the soil volume parallel to the surface  D = W (sin "") (kg/rn') (I)  N the force exerted by the soil volume normal to the slope  (kg/rn')  N = W (cos "") (2)  F the frictional resistance to sliding or shear strength (kg/m2)  F = N (Ian ~)+ C (3)  cf&gt; the angle of internal friction which is ch3!3cteristic of the soil  mass (degrees)  C shear strength of the clay fraction (kg/ml  )  Figure 7. Slope stability relationships using a unit soil block analogy.  available, appropriate values of soil cohesion, C, and the in­ternal  angle affriction, &lt;P, were estimated from the literature  (Burroughs et al. 1976). The following illustrative calcu­lations  should be interpreted onJy as first approximations.  For a planar failure such as a debris avalanche, the  stability of the slope can be analyzed using the analogy of a  unit soil block on a slope as shown in Figure 7_ When F,  the frictional resistance to sliding, is greater than D, the  gravitational force component acting parallel to the slope,  the slope is considered stable and not a hazard. When F is  less than D, the slope is unstable, and a hazard exists. This  relationship is usually expressed by the ratio F /D and termed  the factor of safety, FS. To illustrate changes in stability  that can occur due to increases in soil water content, F and  D were evaluated as functions of soil water content and  slope. Results of these calculations are presented graphically  in Figure 8. Dry soil density was estimated to be 1700 kg  per m3 . A friction angle of 32 degrees was used.  6  Curves for dry soil in Figure 8 show that when soil  water is absent surficial failures can be expected on slopes  exceeding 32 degrees (70%). However, when the soil water  content is near saturation (estimated conservatively as 30%  by volume), failures can be expected on slopes exceeding  16 degrees (35%). For a soil layer 50 cm in depth, 150 mm  of soil water should saturate the layer. As previously  noted, the August 1977 storms developed intensities aver­aging  80 mm per hour over several hours and resulted in  more than 400 mm of total precipitation. Even at low  inftltration rates and low initial soil water storage, this  volume is more than enough to saturate a SO-em soil layer,  or for that matter, a 100-cm deep layer. During the October  survey of the Samseong-Chon and Suam-Chon watersheds  where soil depths were typically a meter or less, all but one  of the 48 slides observed occurred on slopes greater than  II degrees (24%). Only one slide was observed on a slope  exceeding 32 degrees (70%). A similar range of slopes  included most of the surficial slides on the nearby Anson­Chon  watershed_ Here 96 percent of the more than 600  observed failures were found on slopes less than 40 degrees  (89%) CHao 1972). Given the relatively shallow, cohesion­less  soil, reduced cover, and steep slopes in the Samseong­Cheon  and Suam-Cheon drainages, there can be little doubt  that high intensity storms create and will continue to create  conditions leading to highly destructive slope failure.

HAZARD REDUCTION  Structural Can trol  Coates (1977) recently summarized methods for pre­vention  and control of landslides into five categories:  I) Avoidance - by-passing the unstable area,  removing existing dwellings or activity;  2) Water control - decreasing the amount of sur­face  water moving into the slide area, reducing  subsurface water through drainage;  3) Excavation - removing material from the head  of the slide, regrading to reduce slope and hill­side  benching or terracing;  4) Restraining structures - applied at or near the  toe of the slope, these include: a) rock or earth­fill  buttresses, b) shear keys which are com­pacted  fill or buttresses on particular areas of  the slide, c) retaining walls primarily as a  preventive measure- e.g., cribs, bulkheads, dikes ,  etc_, and finally , in limited cases, pilings and  rock bolts;  5) Miscellaneous methods - for special cases in­cluding  drainage of silt soils by electroosmosis,  grouting to enhance cohesion and freezing to  stabilize during construction .  Vegetative Control  It is generally recognized that vegetation has three  primary functions in slope stabilization:  I) Reduction of soil water through evapotrans­piration,  2) Maintenance of high in nItration rates,  3) Consolidation of the soil mass by root systems_  While few quantitative data are available, a recent study by  Burroughs and Thomas (1977) emphasized the importance  of root strength as a factor in slope stability _ In the western  United States, studies of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga men­ziesii  var. glauca) root systems suggest that tensile strength  per unit area of soil declined from 1700 kg per m2 to  about 230 kg per m2 after harvest. This change occurred  over a 3D-month period and suggests the substantial role  root systems have in consolidation of the soil mass. For an  excellent in-depth discussion of this topic the reader is  referred to a review article by Gray (1978), ""The Role of  Woody Vegetation in Reinforcing Soils and Stabilizing  Slopes.""  7  Perhaps the best summary statement about the role  of vegetation with regard to planar slides is provided by  Swanston (l974a): ""In the absence of geological controls  produced by bedrock benches or berms, rooting structures  of trees and other vegetation anchor and bind materials to  the slope and stand out as the most important (natural)  contributor to failure resistance.""  In summary, hazard reduction can be accomplished  by a number of techniques, many of which are appropriate  in combination. Where substantial risk to human life exists,  avoidance is usually preferable , but expensive. Where avoid­ance  is neither feasible nor necessary, a combination of  drainage , structural measures and vegetative control is nor­maUy  employed after a thorough analysis of the specific  problem. In areas where the primary hazard is to the land,  vegetative control with supplemental structural measures,  or drainage is more commonly employed for economy.  DISCUSSION  There are no simple solutions to the slope stability  problems in the Samseong-Cheon,Suam-Cheon and Siheung­Cheon  drainages . The relatively steep slopes, shallow sandy  soils and reduced vegetative cover, when impacted by high  intensity storms during the typhoon season, will continue  to produce substantial numbers of surficial landslides.  Management of the landslide problem should consist of  I) a hazard evaluation and prediction effort to identify  areas which are most likely to slide in the future, and 2) a  slope stabilization program to rehabilitate areas where slides  have already occurred_ The slope stabilization programs  already undertaken by the Korean government in the three  drainages- combining structural measures, drainages and  revegetation- address this latter need.  It was impossible to make a thorough analysis of the  many rehabilitated landslide sites viewed in the survey;  however, the slope stabilization measures appeared to be  generally well designed and constructed_ Good use was  made of on-site materials and inexpensive hand labor. The  basic design included, with minor variations, stone-buttressed  terraces and a central stone-lined drainage channel. Views~  of typical channels in Figures 4 and 6 show the grade reduc­tion  structures without and with mortar , respectively. Note  that the stone buttresses supporting terraces are built on  the contour and without mortar, permitting subsurface  water drainage to appear as surface flow on the terrace  below. Terraces of this design should enhance slope stability  by increaSing frictional resistance to downslope movement  (particularly where the buttresses are keyed into the sub­surface  layer), and by reducing the build-up of pore pressure  through more rapid drainage_ Cost effectiveness for the  current structural rehabilitation program could be measured  in terms of construction costs and the reduction in ground­water  rise (soil pore pressu re) resulting from the drainage  channel and terrace installation. Similarly, hazard prediction  would be greatly enhanced if the relationship of ground·  water rise to given amounts of rainfall were investigated.  These topics should be considered in future development of  a research program.  At the time of this survey vegetation had not been  established on many terraces. The role of vegetation in  slope stabilization should not be overlooked. In particular,  'further study of mechanical reinforcement of the soil mass  by root systems of native species is warranted. Indeed, the  key to greater overall slope stability for highly unstable  drainages may well be in a combined program of vegetative  reestablishment and structural measures on the more  unstable slopes.  Avoidance (removal of housing) has been used to a  degree on the Siheung-Cheon site, but a major threat to  other housing still remains. In the Samseong-Cheon drainage,  a substantial channelization project is in progress in addition  to the slope stabilization effort. The concrete revetments,  overflow basins and dams included in this project should  reduce the flood impact if slope stabilization is successfuL  Otherwise, the masonry work could contribute to the debris  moving through the drainage , increaSing rather than de·  creasing downstream damage.  Recommendations  1. Terraced areas should be revegetated as soon as  pOSSible, adding topsoil and fertilizer as necessary for estab·  lishment. If practical, both perennials and annuals should  be seeded to ensure early and successful establishment of  vegetative cover to reduce surface erosion. Both grasses and  8  woody species should be used to provide a deep and dense  root mass, enhancing both tensile strength and transpiration  rates. Suggested species are:  Grasses  Themeda japonica  Arundinella hirta var. ciliata  Miscanthus sinensis  Woody plants  Pinus rigida  Alnus linctorUI  Robinia pseudoacacia  Lespedeza cyrtobotria  Juniperus koidy  Parthenosissus tricuspidata  2. A hazard evaluation and prediction study should  be made which includes: a) a comprehensive investigation  of rainfall frequency and intensities for these drainages,  b) characterization of the relationship between rainfall and  groundwater rise (pore pressure) as affected by basin size  and shape, c) summarization of soil properties and topo·  graphic data to facilitate estimation of the slope stability  index, FS (factor of safety).  3. Subject to findings in 2 above, cost·effectiveness  of cross·slope drains should be evaluated for a) existing  terraced systems, b) land to be rehabilitated in the future.  4. Regional prescriptions or guidelines for stabili·  zation of landslide areas should be developed based on soil  type, slope, vegetation and rainfall intensity. These prescrip·  tions would serve as models for field personnel; they should  emphasize principles but include case studies. Specific sug·  gestions for structures, vegetation, etc., appropriate to each  region should also be included.  LITERATURE CITED  Anonymous. 1977a. Korea Herald. Seoul, Korea. 10 July.

PREDICTING STREAMFLOW CHANGES CAUSED BY  FOREST PRACTICES USING THE  EQUIVALENT CLEARCUT AREA MODEL  George H. Belt  A PROBLEM AND A SOLUTION  The Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) Model evolved  through the collective effo rt s of hydrologists with the USDA  Forest Service, Northe rn Region (R-l). The eq uiva lent  c1earcut conce pt was first conce ived and applied by H. Lee  Silvey, who described a ""water yield increase analysis  procedure"" fo r the Nezperce Nat ional Forest. Silvey's  procedure and subsequent modifi ca tions and ex tensions by  his co-workers are described in the USDA Forest Service  pub lication, Forest Hydrology, Part II , (USDA 1974) .  This document describes applications of the method on  National Fores-ts in Idaho, Washington , and Montana , whe re  spri ng snowmell is the dominant hydrographic event. For  this reason, the model is designed to describe changes in  mean annual stream flow and does no t model indi vidual  storm eve nt s. The purpose of the following discussion is to  gene ralize these variolls appli cations into a single frame­work,  hereafte r referred to as the ECA model, and to evalu­ate  the model as a predictive tool.  Initially, the ECA model waS conce ived as a means  of est imating the hydro logic impact of additional timber  sales in a drainage where previous harves ting or ot her land  use activities had al ready occurred. The objec tive waS not a  highly acc urate annual forecast of st reamflow, bu t a pro­jection  of streamflow change over time , assuming average  climato logical conditio ns and the current hydrologic con­dition  of the watershed.

The author is Professor of f o rest Resources in the College of  Forestry, Wildl ife and Range Sciences, at the University of Idaho,  Moscow.  ISSN :00734586  drai nage. The times, places, and volumes of timber harvested  are guided by the approp riate siIvicultural prac tices, but  dete rmi ned by many additional considerations in the con­text  of multiple-use management. The ECA model is the  exp ression of future aggrega te increases in wate r y ield  expected as a result of both past and proposed timber har­vests.  Predictions of water y ield in crease thus obtained are  eva lua ted using predetermi ned crite ri a and standards  deve loped for each National Forest.  At the ini tial stage o f developme nt, the model was  used primarily as a too l for project level, e .g., timber sa le,  planning. A typical problem is illu st rated by the fo llowing  example:  Given a timbered drainage of 2500 acres with average  ann ual precipitation of 60 inches and st reamnow of  22 inches, determine the potent ial impact on water  yield and channel stability of two 80·acre timber  sa les planned for 1978 and 1980. Consider in the  eva lu at ion the effects of previo us treatments, i.e.,  a 200-acre commercial t hin ning and 6S-acre clearcut  block harvested in 1964 , a 230-acre fire which  denuded the site and was replanted in ""1965, and a  120-acre powerline right-of-way cleared in 1972 and  mai ntained in brush.  More recently the model has been coded for the  computer and used in fo rmulating environmental impact  statements under the req uirements of the National Envi ron­mental  Policy Act (Rosgen 1974). The eq uivalent clearcut  area concept, as will be illu strated late r, facilitates con­sidera  tion of the hyd rologic impacts of di fferen t forest  pract ices in both t ime and space . He nce, the model lends  itse lf to either project level planning o r the broader unit  planning leve l necessa ry for land use all ocation and environ­menta  l impact assessment.  The following presentation describes the basic form  of the model. Some of the refinemen ts incorporated in  IF mA~O lIBRARV  r -  specific applications and described in Forest Hydrology,  part II, have been omitted for clar ity of presenta tio ll .

THE ECA MODEL  The ECA Model in Concept  The basic concepl devised by Silvey ( 1970) which  subsequently evolved inlo Ihe R-I ECA Model can be  summarized procedurally:  1. Determine wa ter yield for each elevat ion  zone assuming no management activ ity using  local precipitation or other avail able da ta.  2.  3.  4.  Establish the water yield inc rease which would  occur within each zone if harvested by clear­cutting.  Determine the wate r yield increase from ot her  si lvi cultural or related activities and express  th is as a percent of the increase resulting from  ciearclltting.  Project changes in long. term water yield increase  as vegetat ion is reestablished , and express this  as a percent of the original increase by habitat  types.  5. Using selected criteria , compare the projected  change to management standards as indicated  be low in Table I.  General Fonn of the ECA Model  The model is designed to estimate changes in mean  annual st reamflow resulting from forest practices or treat·  men ts which remove or reduce vege tative cover. Treatments  here refers 10 harvesl systems, e.g., t il innings, pa rtial cuts  and clearcuts, but also incl udes road constru ctions, power  li ne and ski·slope clea rings, and nat ural occurrences which  alter the hydrologic charact er of the land- fi re, avalanche,  and in sect infestations. The watershed is described in the  mode l as a dis tributed system where differe nces in hydrol·  ogy are st ra tified by habi tat type , elevat ion, and time. The  driving var iable is the trea tment, i.e., the acreage altered by  nature or man through applica tion of a forest practice. The  wate rshed is modeled as a system in equilibrium ; when  fore st prac tices are applied to the land , the equ ilib rium is  interrupted, and the effects of the practices are described  over lime . Information derived from the model co nsists  of es timates of mean an nual stream flow and changes in  equiva lent clearcut area over time. The major feat ure of  the model is the agg regation of the effects of such treat·  ments over space (by drainage system) and time, in te rms  of a si ngle parameter, equivalent clearc ut area.  Equ ivalent clea rcut area is a normalizing concept  rela ting the hydrol ogic effects of any treatme nt (T) at any  time (I) 10 the hydrologic cha nges produced by ciearculting,  a part icular treatment, during the first year after its occur·  rence. Eq ui va lenl clearcut area was defined by Silvey (1970)  as the ""total area within a drainage that ex.ists in an (equiv.  alent) c1earcut co ndition"" in any given year (t); thus ECA  is a means of lumping the hydrological effects of treatment.  The ECA concep t is incorporated in the model by use of  three dimensionless factors, T, w, and p defined below.  Treatment Factor (T)  The fra ction of treated area (A) which can be con­sidered  as c1ea rcu t area is expressed as the treatment  factor (1). Below, 1 is defined in terms of vegetation density  (D) and treatment (T). Various measures of vegetation  den sity , e.g., board foot or crown cover or percent crown  removal , may be used. Howeve r, the rela tion ship must be  defined from site specific observa tional data for each  tr ea tmen t (T) as shown below.  T (D,T) = /(t = I, T,D) (i)  Table I.

Recovery Factor ( p)  The recovery factor introduces into the model dif­fe  rences in vegetative regrowth rate s subsequent 10 harvest.

Equat ions 12 and 13 represent the basic outputs of  the model. Through use of the appropriate summation s,  these equations can be used to provide various projections  of allowable ECA or streamflow increase in time and space  which are useful in planning. Operational forms of the  model documen ted by Rosgen (1974), Galbraith ( 1975),  and Isaacson ( 1977) incorporate the necessary bookkeeping  procedures for such planning, along with the model.  Use of local data to define the re lationships shown  in Figure 1 is the basic means of refining the general model  to specific applications. Local data for p. w, and q account  for geographical variation in climate. soil, and related  ecological cond itions. Similarly, differences in management  standards or silvicultural practice are incorporated in the  model through the treatmelH factor ( T).  Note that equations 8- 13, which constitute the general  model, do not explicitly cOl1lain the processes (terms) in  4  -  the annual water balance equation expressed below in  equation 14. It is the change ill streamflow (llQ) which is  predicted, nOt Q. Precipitation (PPT) and evapotranspira­tion  (ET) are implicitly contained in equations 11 and 10,  respec tively. Hence, an independent algebraic check of the  water balance is not possible unless independent estimates  of ET and PPT are made.  Model Verification  Verificat ion of a model is the process of checking the  internal logic of the modeled rela tionships. Interna l logic  for the ECA model is based on the normal annual water  balance equation, which can be expressed as:  Q(t = 0) = PPT(t = 0) - ET(t = 0) ± Set = 0) (J 4)  Here S refers to soil water, ground water, and snow storage  as influenced by interception and redistribution of precipi­tation  at the surface. As indicated previously, knowledge  of the above relationships is assumed for land in an undis­turbed  or ""natural"" condition. The natural or reference  cond ition is indicated by t = 0, and the bar denotes a sta­tisticalnorlll.  Within a given ecosystem and climatic regime. variation  in the annual runoff, Q(t) - O(t = 0), is the result of (I)  climate fluctuations and (2) the effects of forest practices.  This is expressed as:  Q(t) = Q(t = 0) ± lIQ (t) ± lIQ(t)  *  (15)  I-Jere llQ (t) is annual variation in streamflow caused by  climate, as indicated by the asterisk.  lIQ (t) = ± lIPPT(t) ± lIET (t) ± liS (t) * •• (16)  Assuming land use does not alter precipitation, i.e., ll PPT(t)  is due solely to clima te, the change in the norma l water  balance equation (14) due to treatment, lIQ(t) , is given by:  lI Q(t) = ± lIET ± liS ( 17)  Systematic differences in ll ET and llS due to ele ­vation  (E), treatment (T), vegetation density (D) and hab itat  type (H) are expressed as additional arguments and incor­porated  in equation 17 as:  lIQ(t,E,T,H,D) = ± II ET(t,E,T,H ,D) ± lI S(t,E,T,H,D) (18)  Recall that:  T = I indicates a clearcu! condition;  t = 1 indicates the first year after treatment; and  [ = 0 indicates the natural or reference land con­dition;  then the factors T, w_and p defined implicitly in equations  8-10 can be defined explicitly in terms of the water balance  using equation 18. Thus we have:  (  E T H)= /l ET(t,E,T=I ,H,O)+ /l S(t,E.T=I.H,O) (19)  P t, "" /l ET(t=I.E,T- I ,I1,O)+ /l S(t-I ,E.T- I.I1 ,O)  /l Q(t ,E,T= I ,H.O)  /l Q(t I,E ,T I ,H,O)  (t E T=I H) = /l Q(t= I ,E,T= I ,H,O)  w "", Q(E,T=O)  .J E T H) w(t ,E,T,H,O)  "" t, "" = w(t,E,T= I ,H,O)  = /l Q(t ,E,T,H,O)  /l Q(t,E.T - I ,H,O)  (19a)  (20)  (21)  (2 1 a)  The dimensionless rat ios defined by equations 8· 10 of  the ECA model do not incorporate all of the arguments  shown in equatiuns 19-2 1. In the model , omission of an  argument indicates that, for computational purposes, the  ratio is considered independent of the argument. Omission  of arguments is due primarily to lack of information.  Using the above definitions for p, T, and w. and sub·  stit uting these into equa tion 13, the stream now in crease is  given by:  (Note that: Q(E,T = 0) = A(t = O,E,T,H ,D) geE))  Q( E THO) !J. = Q- (E T=O) • /lQ(t= I ,E,T= I ,H,O) I"",. ,  Q(E,T=O) (22)  /l Q(t,E,T= I ,H,O)  /l Q(t-1 ,E,T -I.H,O)  Canceling, this reduces to:  /lQ(t,E,T,H,O)  /l Q(t.E.T -I ,H,o)  /l Q(t ,E,T,H,O) = /l Q(t ,E,T.H ,O)  Thus for a given year (I) and land use treatment (T),  the change in streamnow, /l Q(t) (as est imated by the ECA  model), reflects the variation in streamflow due to the  cumulative effects of treatment , but not annua l fluctuation  in climate. Finall y, it should be noted that equations 19a,  20, and 2 1a , although used to define the dimensionless  ratios, p, w, and T, are also state equations re lating flO to  time (P(t)), space (w(E)). or treatment (-c(T)).  Model Validation  The accuracy of the model in predicting streamflow  changes was examined using data fr0111 the Benton Creek  drainage on the Priest River Expe rimental Fo res t. Priest  Ri ver, Idaho. Benton Creek is a second order stream su p­plied  by an area of 950 acres, and has a well documented  hydrologic record and management history (A. R. Stage  1957 ; C.A. Wellner 1976). The watershed is situated in a  cedar-hemlock forest type where precipitation averages  39.4 inches annually. During the 25 years prior to the har­vest  treatment , st reamOow ave raged 17.04 in ches (1349  5  acre feet). Var iation in streamOow was appreciable, having  a standard deviation of 4.3 inches (341 acre feet) or 27 per·  cent.  In 1968 at an ave rage elevation of 4500 fee t, 98 acres  were harvp-st~d by c1earcutting. Road surface area in the  drainage tota led 19.2 acres. Thus, the total treated area  in the drainage was 11 7.2 acres. During the 5 years subse·  quent to harvest , 1969-1 973, annual streamflow averaged  17.32 inches (1371.2 acre feet) Witll a standard deviation of  5.6 (440 acre fee t). Fo r the same 5-year period , precipitation  was 38.2 in ches or 1.2 inches below normal.  Existence of a Treatment Effect  Because of the difference in mean precipitation be­tween  the pretreatment and posttreatment periods , and the  comparative ly few years (5) of posttreatment data , the  treatment effect was first examined independently of the  ECA model. Independent estimates of posttreatment  streamOow were obtained using a reg re ssion eq uation deve l·  oped by Harold Haupt of the USDA Forest Service In ter­moun  tain Forest and Range Experiment Station. This  equat ion , derived from 25 yea rs of pretrea tment precipi­ta  tion and streamnow records , utilizes posttreatment  measurements of winter streamflow, snow storage, and  fall-w inter precipi talion to predict annual streamflow.  This relationship , defined in Table 1 of the Appendix ,  was used to estimate ""natural"" (unaltered by treatment)  streamOow for each year dur ing the postt reatment period.  The average increase thus obtained was 84.5 acre feet for  the 5-year period. To test the statis1ical significance of the  treatment effect, differences between actual measured  st reamnow and the posttrea tment pred ict ed, ""nat ural""  streamOow were compared using a paired (-test. The null  hypothesis, that there was no difference be tween these  pa ired va lues (measured and predicted streamfl ow), was  rejected at the Q5 percent confidence level, indicating that  there was a trea tment effect. This te st and st ream fl ow dif·  ferences are shown in Table 2 of the Appendix.  A second estimate of the treatment effect was ob·  ta ined by subtracting pre treatment and posttreatment  nows. Based on differences between average streamflow  data for the 25-year pretreatment and the 5·year posttreat­ment  period s, the streamnow in crease is 0.28 inches  (17.32-17.04) or 22.17 acre fee t. However, sin ce precipita­tion  was below normal during the 5-year posttreatment  pe riod , a furt her adjustment was made. Using the mean  precip ita tion, 39.4 inches, and ave rage runoff, 17.04 inches  for the pretreatment period, the deli ve ry rate (17.04/39 .4)  was estimated to be 43 percent for the posttreatment  period. Thus, to adjust the posttreatme nt runoff for below  normal precipitat ion ,43 pe rcen t of 1.2 inches(0.52 in ches),  or 40.85 acre feet, was added to the previously computed  22.17 acre feel. TllUS, for the 5-year period , the estimated  st reamOow increase averages 63.0 acre feet per year. Since  the delivery-rate adjustment did not consider .60 resulting  from treatment , 63 acre feet per year is a conservative  estimat e.  The magni tude of the above es ti mates is fu rt her sup­po  rted by data supplied by Haupt (personal communication)  describing increases in water yield measured direc tly on the  98 acre cJearcut. Measuring snowmelt with Iysimeters, and  soil water storage changes with a neutron probe, Haupt  found the water yield to be 12.1 inches greater on the clear­cut  acres than on adjacent undisturbed fores t. If the total  on·site increase was deli vered to the stream channel, this  would correspond to an annual increase of 1.25 in ches or  99 acre feet for th e enti re watershed area. Since it is unlikely  that the IOtal on-site yield was delivered to th e channel, the  actual yield would be less than 99 ac re feet. Variabili ty in  potential water yield ga in s due to treatment is further docu­mented  by Cline et al. (1 977).  In summary, clearcuLting 98 acres of the 950 acre  watershed (10 .3%) resulted in a stat ist icall y signin cant  average water yie ld increase for the 5·year posLtreatment  period. Estimates of the magnitude of the in crease range  from 63 to less than 99 acre fee t. The best es ti ma te of yield  increase is taken to be 83 acre feet based upon the regression  re lationship obta ined from 25 years of da ta.  Estimating th e Treatment Effect With the ECA Model  Using the ECA mode l, annual streamflow increases  were calculated as shown in Table 2. TIle largest increase in  1969 was 63.8 ac re fee t ; during the fifth year the increase  dimin ished to 42.8 acre fee t. The average increase over the  5 years as predi cted by the model is 5 1.3 acre fee t. Thus,  the 5-year average streamfl ow increase of 51.3 acre feet  ob tained using the ECA model provides a conse rva tive esti­mate  in comparison to the preceding va lues of 63 and 85  acre fe et.  Tes ting the Predicted Treatment Effect  Annua l strea mflow increases due to trea tment pre­dicted  by the ECA model (and listed in Table 2) were added  to the ""natural"" streamflow calculated using the previously  described regression equat ion. These estimat ed annual  postt reatment flows we re then compared with measured  posttreatment flows using a paired t-test. The null hy po·  thesis was that no difference existed between measured  streamflow and estimated streamflow. The hypothesis was  accepted at th e 95 percent confidence level. This is reason­able  in that the average difference between estimated and  measured streamflow was 0.42 inches or 2 .4 percent of the  average measured posttreatment flow. (Data and stati stics  appear in Tab le 3 of the Appendix.)  However, despite the fact that to tal slreamnow was  estimated to within 2 .4 percent using the ECA model, it  must also be recogni zed that the water yield increase due to  treatment was underestimated by 40 percent (85-5 1/85).

Error Propagation in the ECA Model  As can be seen in equations 8-J 3, the basic model  has a mult iplicative form where the dependent variable is  computed as the product of seve ral independent variables .  The ques tion then is: given a value for each independent  var iable and an estimate of th e error in this value, what is  the magn itude of the error expected in the dependent  var iable. In other words, how sensit ive would estimat es  of ECA or Q(t) be to errors in measurement or errors in  the re lationships shown in Figu re I?  Multi plica tive erro r propagation can be expressed as  follows. Let ex' By, and 8z be erro rs in the independent  var iab les x, y, z, respect ive ly. The error in the product xyz  can then be written :  +  8xyz = (X-8x) • (y ± 8y) • (z ± 8z) - xyz (23)  ECA is calculated as th e product of A, p and T as  shown in equation 5. To ill ustrate error propagation in ECA  estimates, the error in ECA (for 1976) will be calculated  for a 100-acre clearcllt harvested in 1970. In the example.  the clearcut is assumed to be located within a single habitat  type and eleva tion zone. The erro rs are assumed to be:  -  6A = I acre (1 percent)  6 = 0.1 (10 percent of the first year on·site water  P yie ld)  ST = 0 (the treatment is a c1earcut ; no error is involved  by definition)  Rewriting equation 23 using a va lue for p of 0.6,  obtained from Figure I , gives:  ~CA (1 976) = [(100 ± 1)(0.6 ± 0.1)(1.0 ± 0)] ·60  Taking the worst case, the larger error, ~CA (1976),  is found to be:  ~CA (1976) = [(IOI)(.70XI)] ·60 = 10 .7 acres (24)  Sin ce the ECA estimate (100 acXO.6X I.0) is 60 ac res, the  re lative error is 17.8 percent (10.7/60). Continuing this  example , since only one treatment (c1earcut) occurs ,  /l Q(t) can be ca lculated by:  /l Q(t) = ECA(t) . q(E) • w (E) (25)  Rewriting equation 23, the error in /l Q(t) is:  (26)  9/1Q(t) = [(ECA ± ~CA) • (q ± 9ij) • ( w ± 9w)] . /l Q(t)  If it is assumed that both q(E) and w (E) can be  determined within 10 percent, i.e ., had an error of 10  percent , then these errors are:  9q = ± 0.1 (q(E» = ± .1 3 ft  9w = ±. I (w(E» = ± .04  (10 percent of the normal on·site water yield)  (27)  (28)  Using the va lue previously estimated for ~CA of 10.7  acres, the error in water yield increase in acre feet is com­puted  as:  9/1Q(t) = [( IOO ± 10.7) . (1.3± .13) · (.4± .D4)] . /l Q(t)  where /lQ(t) = (100) ' (1 .3) . (.4) = 52  Again taking the worst case:  6/1Q (1976) = [(110.7) . (1.43) . (.44)J . 52 = 17.65  The relative error is ( 17.65/52) or 34 percent. This example  illustrates how errors in the independent variab les can  accumulate in the dependent variables, ECA(t) and /l Q(t).  However, in practice it is reasonable to assume that some of  the error will be compensating, and hence the relative error  of the dependent variab les would be reduced.  7  Improving Model Sensitivity  While formu lated as a distributed parame ter system ,  the model does not explicitly conside r: I) aspect, which is  an important index to energy availability for evapo­transpiration  and snowmelt , 2) routing procedures to  express differences in waler yield due to topographic  position (within an elevation zone) or previous treatment.  Aspect is in part expressed by habitat type and  therefore implicitly considered in the recovery factor (p).  Since the recovery funct ion is by definition determined in  part by the vegetative regrowth on the site, and rate of  regrowth is known to differ with aspect, a more explicit  expression of aspect would seem appropriate. Redefinition  of the recovery fac tor (p) as a function of habitat type (H),  aspect and time, would permit the in clusion of aspect as a  distributed variab le and should increase the model's sensi­tivity  to treatment effects.  Routing of subsurface flow is achieved in the model  through strat ification of w and Q(t=O) by elevation. This  procedure does not consider differences in delivery effi­ciency  which could occur within the same elevation zone  due to soil differences or topographic locat ion and their  interaction. For example, clearcuts separated from stream  chan nels only by a buffer strip , would normally have a  re lative ly high de livery efficiency. In contrast, upslope  clearcuts not immediately adjacent to a channel where  subsurface flow must move an appreciable distance down­slope  would normally have a red uced delivery efficiency,  due to additional ET and soil water storage losses. Still  additional losses (and red uction in delivery efficiency)  could occur if the subsurface water from such upslope  clea rcuts passed through a previously c1earcut area. Here  fast growing reproduction could further reduce the sub·  surface flow in contrast to passage through a more mature  stand . Both the effects of topographic location and pre·  vious treatment should be incorporated in the water yield  increase factor {w}. This modification shou ld enhance the  ability of the model to discriminate between the cumulative  effects of alternate harvesting proposals.  Summary and Conclusions  The general ECA model provides a relatively Simple  framework for evaluat ion of the hydrologic impacts of  forest practices. The primary feature of the model is the  use of the ECA concept to indicate the current status of the  watershed and to predict the net combined impact of  current and proposed forest practices. The model is not  designed for determination of extreme hydrographic events  or individual storm hyd rographs. The model does estimate  annual streamflow increases under average climatic con­ditions  and is most appropriate for areas where the snow­me  lt hydrograph is the dominant hydrographic event.  Accuracy of model predictions depends primarily on  the availability of loca l hydrologic data (w and &lt;D and the  r  l  ability of the user to define local treatment effects, (Pt T).  Because of the multiplicative fOfm of the model , accumu­lated  error could be significant, as previously illustrated.  Viewed in an operational context and employed by  experienced professionals . the model provides a rational  tool with relatively modest data requirements. With refine­ment  it has the potential of becoming an even more effec­tive  and sensitive means of predicting the hydrologic effects  of forest practices.  LITERATURE CITED  Cline, R.G. , 1-I. F.

Long-Term Vegetation Changes in Permanent Quadrats at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Site,"The objective of this study was to detect long-term changes in natural vegetation of the area (Snake River Plain) that could be due to various natural or anthropogenic factors.  Central to the goals of the sponsoring organization were detection and description of the effects of chronic exposure of plants to ionizing radiation from radionuclide deposited in the vicinity of test reactors and other facilities at the site.  Virtually nothing was known at the time about the sensitivity of native species of plants to chronic radiation, nor of the response of communities to such plant sensitivity.  Due to differences of grazing impact in various localities of the region, and to the fact that distinct vegetation types were evident, these factors were incorporated in the design of plot distribution.  Little was known of the long-term vegetation changes resulting from normal climatic variability or successional dynamics in the sagebrush-grass region.  There was much speculation but  little evidence of the impact of grazing in the region.  Large plots were established because of the desire to include numerous individual plants of each species in locations near radiation sources, and because some vegetation types are limited in extent.","French, Norman R.; Mitchell, John E.",,1983-11-01,plant damage; radiation injury;,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Bulletin Number 36,"Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b36,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Day  and  I NTRO DUCTION  The maintenance and perpetuation of park ecosys­tems  are becoming increasingly difficult. Knowledge and  understanding of park resources provide keys to their pro­tection.  A first step in this process is the development of  base-line measures of key resources. In most parks, data  on vegetation resources are important base-I ine components.  Beyond providing information on the vegetation composi­tion  of a park, such information is also useful in developing  fire management plans and delineating wildlife habitat.  This report describes the plant communities and presents  a vegetation type map (in envelope, back cover) for Craters  of the Moon National Monument.  STUDY AREA  Craters of the Moon National Monument (CRMO)  is located on the northern edge of the Snake River Plain  in southcentral Idaho . The 21,650 ha (53 ,500 ac) monu­ment  encompasses a narrow belt of faults, fissures, cones,  and craters called the Great Rift, which extends southeast­ward  through the area. Elevations range from 1625 m  (4880 ft) to 2355 m (7730 ft). Soils are derived from  basaltic magma reSUlting from several volcanic eruptions  which have occurred at least every 2500 years, with the  most recent being about 2200 years ago (Kuntz et al.  1983).  T he authors are Graduate Student, Department of Range Resources,  College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, University of  Idaho {currently at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory,  Colorado State University} ; and Project Leader, National Park  Service Cooperative Park Studies Unit, and Associate Professor of  Wildlife Resources, College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sci·  ences, University of Idaho.  ISSN :0073-4586  R. Gerald Wright  Many of the more vegetated areas in the monument  are separated from surrounding vegetated areas on the  Snake River Plain by relatively barren lava flows up to five  km wide. These flows make travel difficult and have led  to little use by domestic livestock. Relatively little free  water over most of the monument has also prevented sig­nificant  use by domestic livestock, and limits mule deer  use of the southern two-thirds of the monument during  late summer (Griffith 1983). These factors, combined with  the management protection afforded by the area's wil­derness  status, have resulted in little non-natural disturbance  of the plant communities, and many areas appear to be in  pristine condition. Due to this, vegetation on Carey Kipuka,  an older, more developed island of vegetation surrounded  by lava in the monument, has been used as a reference for  climax vegetation (Tisdale et al. 1965). Range condition  on environmentally similar sites throughout southern Idaho  is based largely on a comparison of their vegetation with  that of Carey Kipuka.  Because of the above factors, most of the vegetation  within the monument appears to be in a climax or near­climax  stage. However, due to a combination of young  parent material and extremely harsh environmental condi­tions  (e.g., high surface soil temperatures in summer and  low available moisture), the vegetation in several areas of  the monument is in relatively early stages of primary  succession (Day 1985) . It is thus difficult to classify with  current climax plant community descriptions (e .g., habitat  types) such as those of Hironaka et al. (1983). This project  did not attempt to describe the vegetation of CRMO in  terms of habitat types or the potential or climax plant  communities of a given area . Rather, the vegetation types  (e.g., present vegetation of an area) were used as the basis  for a classification. Under the relatively harsh environ·  mental condition of the monument, rates of secondary  succession are quite slow, and knowledge of present vege­tation  is most useful for management purposes. The plant  communities described and mapped in this paper are not  to be inferred to be discrete communites. In many cases,  boundaries drawn between types were made along a con­tinuous  gradient between two communities.  METHODS  Field work was done during the summers of 1982  and 1983. A general reconnaissance of the monument  was conducted during the 1982 field season and about 100  areas were sampled. Foliar cover by species and bare  ground was estimated using six cover classes at each area  us ing a lOx 15·m plot.  During the fall, apparent vegetation types were de­lineated  on clear mylar placed over 1 :15000 scale color  aerial photographs of the monument. Areas sampled during  the 1982 field season were used to interpret the results.  The resultant vegetation map was ground-truthed during  the 1983 field season. Many of the boundaries delineated  on the aer ial photos had to be revised, as there were differ­ences  among many vegetation types that were not apparent  in the photographs. Conversely, several color differences  which appeared in the photos were not apparent in the  actual vegetation; these boundaries were also revised. These  color differences were usually due to shading, reflection,  and soil color differences. An overflight of the monument  in mid·June 1983 also helped identify vegetation types,  especially in remote locations in the south end.  Vegetation types were delineated based on the most  dominant and conspicuous species and on those species  having high relative cover within an area. Types with signif­icantly  different life forms, and thus relatively easily separ­ated,  were delineated with a resolution of approximately  two ha (five ae). Separation of those types that were not  readily differentiated was done at a lower level of resolu­tion.  In those portions of CRMO north of the highway and  accessible by road, these latter types were delineated jf a  vegetation type covered more than approximately four ha  (10 ae) . In remote areas, these types were delineated if  they covered more than approximately 10 ha (25 ae) .  The final vegetation map was corrected to a 1 : 24000  scale USGS topographic map of the monument using a  zoom·transfer scope. The total area covered by each vege·  tation type was determined using an electronic digitizer.  A total of 26 vegetation types were identified and  mapped. The common names for all plants listed are  given in the appendix. In the descriptions that follow,  standard abbreviations are used for certain common grasses  and shrubs following their first mention. Nomenclature  follows Hitchcock and Cronquist (1973) and Cronquist  et aL (1977). Photographs of each of the types are can·  tained in copies of the report on file in CRMO library.  2  DESCRIPTION OF VEGETATION TYPES  1. Cinder Gardens  A cinder surface and low total plant cover (generally less  than five percent in mid-summer) separate this community  from all others. It is dominated by Eriogonum ovolifolium  var. depressum, which is conspicuous due to its persistent  leaves. Species common into mid-July include Phacelio  hdstata, Cryptantha interrupta, Aster canescens, Chaenactis  douglasii, Lygodesmia spinosa, and 5tephanomeria tenui­folia.  In June, when growing conditions are most favor­able,  Mimulus nonus and Mimulus suksdorfii, both annuals,  and perennials AI/ium simillimum and Lewisio rediviva are  common. Some areas of this type are devoid of higher  plants due to extremely harsh conditions. In some cases  (such as Sheep Trail Butte), these conditions apparently  result from large-sized cinders which reduce available soil  moisture. Disturbances on cinder areas which cause depres­sions  in the surface (such as vehicle tracks) may actually  enhance plant establishment, but often lead to unnatural  plant patterns (Day 1985).  2. Low Density Lava Flows  These flows of a'a, pahoehoe, and block lava are generally  the youngest in the monument and have re latively low  plant cover. Shrubs provide less than five percent of the  total cover and include Chamaebatiaria millefolium (Chmi),  Holodiscus spp., Philadelphus lewisii and Haplopappus  nanus. On more favorable microsites, Purshia lridentata  (Putr) and Leptodactylon pungens are common. Artemi·  sia tridentata (Artr) ssp. vaseyono is common in this type  in southern portions of the monument. Common forbs  include Penstemon deustus, Cymopterus terebenlhinus,  Erigeron compositus, Eriogonum umbel/alum, Cirsium spp.  Stephanomeria tenuifolio and Potentillo glonduloso. The  most common grasses are Poa sandbergii (Posa) and 5i­tonion  hystrix (Sihy).  3. Medi um Density Lava Flows  These areas have higher vegetational cover than the above  type (up to 15%), although species composition is quite  similar. The shrubs Putr, Holodiscus spp., Chrysothamnus  nouseosus (Chna), and Chmi are common along with Artr  ssp . voseyana which dominates some of these flows, espe­cially  in southern portions of the monument. The forbs  common on the low density lava flows are also present  here. The forbs of more developed communities adjacent  to these medium density flows occur in this type in more  favorable mierosites. The grasses Stipa thurberiana (Slth)  and Oryzopsis hymenoides are common along with Posa  and Sihy.  4. Mountain Big Sagebru sh/ Bluebuneh Wheatgrass  This vegetation type is widespread in the monument and is  quite diverse in composition. The dominant shrub is Artr  ssp. voseyono. Agropyron spicatum (Agsp) is the dominant  I  I  I .'  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  f  I  I  ·1  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  'I  I  I  •  grass. Putr is common throughout this type and in some  areas occurs in higher den sities than Artr ssp. vaseyano.  North of the highway Symphoricarpos oreophilus (s yor)  and Amelanchier alnifolia are common, especially in more  mesic sites such as north-facing slopes and ravines. On  these sites, Agastaehe urtieifolia and Helianthella uniflora  arc common. Me/iea bulbosa occurs in the more mesic  areas of this type, being confined to Little Cottonwood  Canyon.  On many of the less favorab le sites, such as rock outcrops,  Balsamorhiza sogittata is common. At upper elevations  in areas of high snow accumulation along leeward sides of  ridges, Ceanothus velutinus and Syor form small dense  stands. In little Cottonwood Canyon, where soi ls are more  developed, Chrysothamus viscidiflorus replaces Chna in  th is type. On many areas having a cinder substrate, Cymo­pterus  terebinth inus forms a dense understory.  5. Mountain Big Sagebrush/Sandberg Bluegrass  Th is vegetation type occurs on less mesic or shallower soil  sites than type number four. There is also generally more  barren ground than in the latter type. Arlr ssp. vaseyana  and Posa dominate. Chrysothamnus spp., Putr, Leptodae­ty/  on pungens, Eriogonum heracleoides, E. umbel/a tum,  E. microthecum, and E. ovalifolium are also common.  Stth and Agsp are common on more favorable sites in th is  type.  6. Mountain Big Sagebrush/ Needle Grass  This type occurs on sandy, often shallow soils, in southern  portions of the monument. The dominan t shrub is Artr  ssp. vaseyana, and Putr is also common. Eriogonum hera­cleoides  and E. umbel/atum are common understory spe­cies.  Common grasses include Stipa comata, Stth, X  Stiporyzopsis bloomeri and Oryzopsis Iwmenoides. Agsp  is common in cer tain areas, and this leads to a mosaic  effect. Areas where patches of Agsp were interspersed  among larger areas dominated by Stipa spp. were included  in this type.  7. Mountain Big sagebrush/ Needle·and-thread/Cheatgrass  This area is confi ned to a south-facing slope at the mouth  of Little Cottonwood Canyon. Artr ssp. vaseyana domi­nates,  and Putr is common. The dominant grasses are  Stipa comata and Bromus tectorum, with the latter forming  a dense stand over much of this type. It is not known if  this type is seral, but it appears to be relatively stable.  8. Mountain Big Sagebrush/ Idaho Fescue  This type covers north and northeast-facing slopes in Little  Cottonwood Canyon and on Carey Kipuka. In the former  area, it occurs adjacent to type number fou r. Artr ssp.  vaseyana occurs in sporad ic clumps and at lower densities  in this type than in type 4. A rel ative ly dense stand of  3  herbaceous vegetation is present between shrubs and is  codominated by the grasses Festuea idahoensis (Feid) and  Koeleria nitida. Common forbs are Castilleja miniata  and Lupinus argenteus.  On Carey Kipuka, it should be noted, the dominant Arte·  misia is A. tridentata ssp. tridentata, apparently due to  deeper soils (Hironaka et al. 1983). For si mpl ic ity, this  area is classified in this type. Vegetation on Carey Kipuka  has been described by Ti sdale et al. (1965).  9. Big sagebrush/Cheatgrass  This type is found on Carey Kipuka and appears to be a  relatively stable seral stage of the Big Sagebrush/Idaho Fes­cue  habitat type. Artr ssp. tridentata is the dominan t  shrub. Bromus tectorum occurs in a rel atively dense stand  an d is interspersed with individuals of Feid, Agsp, and  occasional forbs found in the above habitat type.  10. Complex of Types 4 and 8  This complex occurs in Little Cottonwood Canyon and  contains all species common in both the Mountain Big Sage­brush/  Bluebunch Wheatgrass and Mountain Big Sagebrush/  Idaho Fescue types.  11 . Three-tip Sagebrush/ Idaho Fescue  This type occurs on relatively steep north·facing slopes in  upper Little Cottonwood Canyon. Artemisia tripartita  is the dominant shrub, but occurs in relatively low densi­ties.  Other woody species are generally lac king, with the  exception of scattered individuals of Tetradymia canescens  and Eriogonum heracleoides. Forbs include Lupinus  argenteus, Antennaria sp., Sedum stenopetalum and Phlox  hoodii. Common grasses include Koeleria nitida, Fei d,  and Posa.  12. Early Low Sagebrush/ Idaho Fescue  This type is restricted to a small but distinct area on Carey  Kipuka. The dominant shrub is Artemisia longiloba, which  forms a relatively open stand. Common Forbs include  Antennaria stenophyllus, Eriogonum caespitosum, and  Phlox hoodii. The dominant grass is Feid, while stth is  common.  13. Low Sagebrush /Sandberg Bluegrass  This type occurs on exposed, wind-swept ridges along  Little Cottonwood Canyon. Total plant cover is less than  40%. So ils are shallow and gravelly. Artemisia arbuscula  is the only shrub present in most areas. Common forbs  include Haplopappus acaulis, Phlox hoodii, Oxytropis  lagopus, Eriogonum eaespitosum, and Castilleja spp. The  dominant grass is Posa. At higher elevations Leueopoa  kingii is also common.  At its lowest elevation in the monument, this type occupies  an exposed ridge that has been covered by at least 0.5 m  of cinders near Sunset Cone. Here it appears that the  Artemisia present is a hybrid between A. tripartita and A.  arbuscula.  14. Low Sagebrush/ Idaho Fescue  This area occurs on sites sim ilar to the above type but on  finer textured and/or deeper soi ls. Posa is replaced by  Feid in this type. Total cover is higher in this type than  cover in type number 13, but species richness is similar.  15. Complex of Types 13 and 14  This type occurs on exposed ridges and is composed of mo·  saics of the Low Sagebrush/Sandberg Bluegrass and Low  Sagebrush/ Idaho Fescue types.  16. Antelope Bitterbrush  This type covers large areas of the younger cones. Gener­ally,  plant cover is greater than 50 percent, and the domi­nant  shrub is a relatively low growing form of Putr. Chna  and Ribes cereum are the other common shrubs. Pinus  flexilis and Artr ssp. vaseyana are present as scattered in­dividuals.  Common forbs include Delphinium andersonii,  Eriogonum umbel/atum, E. ovalifolium, Mimulus nanus,  and Phace/ia hastata. The most common grasses are Sihy,  Stth and Posa, with Agsp found on the more favorable  sites.  17. Antelope Bitterbrush/Great Basin Wildrye  Found on slopes of medium-aged and older cinder cones,  the dominant shrub in this type is Pu tr. Other common  shrubs include Chna, Syor, and Eriogonum herac/eoides.  Ribes cereum and Artr ssp . vaseyana occur as scattered  individuals. Common forbs include Balsamorhizo sagittata,  Arabis holboellii, Eriogonum umbel/atum, and Lithosper­mum  ruderale. Cymopterus terebinthinus forms a relatively  dense understory in much of this type, especially where  grass density is low. The most conspicuous grass is Elymus  cinereus, alth ough Agsp occurs in much higher densities  than Elymus in many areas of this type.  18. Bluebunch Wheatgrass/ ldaho Fescue  This type occurs on limited areas on north-facing slopes  at upper elevations in little Cottonwood Canyon. These  areas appear to be more mesic (due to snow accumu lation)  than adjacent areas which contain a sh rub component.  Forbs from both the Mountain Big Sagebrush/Bluebunch  Wheatgrass and the Three·tip Sagebrush/ Idaho Fescue types  are present.  19. Bluebunch Wheatgrass/Sandberg Bluegrass  This ty pe occurs on three older cones in the monument,  Round Knoll , Two·Point Butte, and Coyote Butte. On the  4  first two, this type appears to be relatively stable with no  signs of recent disturbance. This type was noted by Eggler  (1941) on Round Knoll. The shrubs are inconspicuous and  are dominated by relatively low-growing species such as  Leptodactylon pungens and Eriogonum microthecum.  Artr ssp . vaseyana and Putr are infrequent. Forbs include  Chaenactis douglasii and Crepis acuminata. Agsp and Posa  are the most common grasses, along with lesser amounts  of Slipa comata.  Th is type also occurs on Coyote Butte where it appears to  be seral, due to signs of past disturbance from fire and the  apparent invasion of young individuals of Artr ssp. vaseyana,  Putr, and Chna. Common grasses include Agsp, Posa, and  Bromus tectorum. Other grasses present include Sihy,  Stth, and Elymus cinereus.  20. Great Basin Wildrye  This type occurs on al lu vial fans where drainages enter  the lava plains. Elymus cinereus is the dominant plan here  and forms relative ly dense stands. Artr ssp. vaseyana and  Chna are occasional. Several weedy forbs are present  between Elymus individuals, including Mentzelia albicaulis,  Capsel/a bursa-pastoris, Gayophytum decipiens, and Lap­pula  redowskii.  21. limber Pine/ Antelope Bitterbrush (Low Total Cover).  This area is composed of large, block type lava remnants  interspersed with cinder gardens (such as Devil's Orchard).  At more favorable microsites (such as around the edges of  lava blocks where moisture accumulates), Pinus flexilis  is common. The dominant shrub is Putr, and Chna, Chmi,  Artr ssp. vaseyana, Leptodac.tylon pungens, and .Ribes  cereum are common. Common forbs include Mimulus  nanus, Gayophytum decipiens, Calyptridium roseum,  Eriogonum umbel/atum and E. ovalifolium. Common  grasses include Stth, Sihy, Oryzposis hymenoides, and Posa.  Cinder patches are dominated by plants typical of the  cinder gardens.  22. Limber Pine/Antelope Bitterbrush (High Total Cover).  This type is found on young to medium -age cinder cones.  Total vegetative cover is higher in these areas than the low  cover type above, due to the absence of lava blocks. Putr  is the dominant shrub and occurs in a relatively low form.  Other common shrubs include Chna, and Ribes cereum.  Artr ssp . vaseyana is common on more favorable sites  where soils contain a significant buried epipedon within  one meter of the surface. Common forbs include Eriogo­num  umbel/atum, E. ovalifolium, Mimulus nanus, and  Gayophytum decipiens. Grasses include Stth, Sihy, and  Posa. Agsp is limited to more favorab le microsites.  23. limber Pine/Antelope Bitterbrush (High Density  limber Pine).  Relatively high densities of Pinus flexi!is occur in this type  on more favorable north-to-east·facing slopes of cinder  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  d  f  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  cones. Species richness is similar to the above type, al­though  on older and/or more mesic si tes, such as Silent  Cone, Pseudotsuga menziesi; is present, but less common  than Pinus flexilis. On these sites th e shrubs Syor and  Prunus virginiano are common.  24. Douglas·fir/Mountain Snow berry  This type is found on relatively steep, north -facing slopes of  older cinder cones and along Little Cottonwood Canyon.  Pseudotsuga menziesi; is the do minant tree, with occasional  indi viduals of Pinus flexilis present. Generally, more than  50 percent of the soil surface is devo id of vegetation, but  it is covered by a layer of litter. The dominant understory  shrub is Syor. Prunus virginiana is common, especially  in areas of higher light intensities. Salix spp. is also present,  and common forbs include Mertensia ciliata, Valeriano  acuti/oba and Potentilla glandulosa. Common grasses pre­sent  in this t ype include Posa, Feid, and Agropyron trachy­caulum.  25 . Upland Quaking Aspen  The}e areas occur on upland sites generally away from  permanent stream courses. Populus tremulaides is the  dominant tree species. The understory consists of scat­tered  individuals of Syor and occasional individuals of  Salix spp., along with a relative ly dense layer of forbs and  grasses. Common forbs include Geranium viscosissimum,  Castilleja miniata, Lupinus argenteus, and Aguilegia for­mosa.  Common grasses include Poa pratensis, Agropy­ron  trachycaulum, Stipa occidentalis var. nelsonii, and  Feid .  26. Riparian  This type is differentiated from the above type by its dense  woody vegetation, close proximity to a permanent water­course,  and the presence of a dense layer of tall forbs. The  dominant tree species form a mosaic which consists of  patches of Populus tremuloides, P. trichocarpa, Prunus  virginiana, Salix spp., Alnus incana, and Betula glandulosa.  The latter three are more common at higher elevations. In  t he more mesic areas, a dense ta ll forb component is con­sp  icuous and is dominated by Heracleum lanatum, Urtica  dioica, and Angelica pinnato. Rudbeckio occidentolis,  Agastache urticifolio and Aquilegia formoso are also com­mon.  Table 1. The areas occup ied by each vegetation type.

Canyon Grasslands and Associated Shrublands of West-central Idaho and Adjacent Areas,"Grasslands dominated by perennial bunchgrasses occupy the canyon-like valleys of the Snake and Salmon Rivers and their tributaries in west-central Idaho.  The grassland areas differ in elevation from 215 to 2400 m. (710-7800 feet) with slopes commonly of 45 to 70 percent and ranging to over 100 percent.  Soils, mainly Xerolls, derived from volcanic materials are permeable and relatively stable.  Vertical zonation of climate, vegetation and soils prevails, modified mainly by differences in aspect.  Plant communities (series) characterized by Agropyron spicatum, Festuca idahoensis and Carex hoodii respectively, occupy most of the grassland area and form five habitat types.  Minor types of less certain seral status occur at low elevations and are dominated by Sporobolus cryptandrus and Aristida longiseta.  Small inclusions of shrub grass types are dominated by Artemisia rigida, Symphoricarpos albus, Rhus glabra, Cercocarpus ledifolius and Celtis reticulata.  Vegetation altered by the effects of livestock grazing in the century of white settlement shows extensive loss of native species and replacement by aliens, mainly of Mediterranean origin.  Principal invaders were Bromus tectorum and other annual bromes, but others, including several species of Centaurea, are increasing on depleted sites.","Tisdale, E.W.",,1986-04-01,xerolls;,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station","Bulletin - Number 40, April 1986","Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b40,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Annotated Bibliography of Larch Casebearer Parasitoids,"Over 560 references dealing with parasitoids that attack the larch case bearer, Coleophor laricells, (Hubner) are contained in this bibliography.  As the larch case bearer is an introduced species in North America, with subsequent releases of its native parasites from Europe and Asia, a worldwide search of the literature was conducted.  In addition to citations specifically concerning parasitism of the larch case bearer, papers dealing with alternate hosts of case bearer parasitoids and references related to the significance of understory vegetation to parasitoid survival and effectiveness are included.  These subjects are deemed important, considering the extensive effort made in North America to import parasitoids for control of the larch case bearer.

Wenny  R. Kasten Dumroese  Introduction  The University of Idaho College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences operates a research nursery  produCing 850,000 containerized seedlings annually. The  facility serves as a laboratory and offers practical  experience to students in agricu lture, forestry, and forest  nursery management. Reforestation seedlings produced at  the nursery are annually planted on state lands, private  forest industry lands, and on the University of Idaho  Experimental Forest. Field data on outplanted seedlings  coupled with detailed crop histories maintained by the  nursery produce feedback for future crops.  Microcomputers are used to monitor seedling  development and to guide cultural pradices yielding  seedlings with high survivabi lity and growth.  Grand Fir  Grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl.) Lindl.) occurs most  frequently on deep, moist, alluvial soi ls in gulches, along  streams, and on gentle mountain slopes. This species  occasionally forms pure stands, but is most often found  with Douglas-fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine in  the Rocky Mountains (Harlow et al. 1979). Mature tree  heights range from 115 to 200 feet (35 to 61 m), and  stems are 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.2 m) in diameter at breast  height  This true fir begins to bear cones at about 20 years  of age. The number of seeds per pound for northern  Idaho grand fi r ranges from 16,500 to 28,800, with a  mean of 19,750.  Grand fir has been cultivated since 1830 (Franklin  1974). The following is a synopsis of the methodology  used at the University of Idaho Forest Research Nursery  to produce containerized grand fir seedlings for research,  conservation, and reforestation.  The Forest Research Nursery  Seedlings are grown in two 34- by 108-foot fiberglass  greenhouses and one 30- by 96-foot double-poly  greenhouse, all conneded by a head house. Each  greenhouse is heated by two natural gas heaters and  vented with two 48-inch exhaust fan and louver systems.  Two 24-inch ventilating fans provide air and heat  circulation through poly-tubes placed beneath the  growi ng benches in each house. We feel poly-tubes  placed in this manner rather than overhead aid in air  circulation and drying beneath the benches and allow  supplemental heat to rise through the trays. An  evaporative cooling system and shutters along the north  side of the facility are used for cooling. Photoperiod is  extended by incandescent lamps at an intensity of 500  lux.  The pH of the well water averages 6.8. Irrigation is  applied through an overhead traveling boom system. We  generally sow numerous small lots of several species, and  the boom allows us to attend to the specific irrigation,  fertilization, and pesticide needs of the individual lots.  There are two booms per greenhouse, with nozzles every  8 inches. Fertilizers and pesticides are applied through  the irrigation water by using a 1:100 injector.  Seed Quality Tests  Each lot of seed is evaluated for quality upon re­ceipt.  The evaluation includes seeds per pound, purity  percentage, soundness, and germination.  Seeds per Pound  The number of seeds per pound is calcu lated by  weighing each of five replications of 100 seeds to the  nearest 0.Q1 gram. The mean weight is then placed into  this equation:  45,360  Seeds per pound - ------,--- ---,---­mean  weight in grams of 100 seeds  Purity Percentage  Purity is determined by removing the ""debris"" from a  55-gram (2,500-seed) sample of seed. Grand fir should  be cleaned during processing and should have at least  95-percent pure seed.  Clean seed weight  Pu rity % - -;::;----,--:-:-----:-,-.,--:-:-- x 100  Clean seed weight + debris weight  Soundness Percentage  The percentage of hollow seeds is determined by x­raying  a 100- to 200-seed sample. This could also be  UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO LIBRARY  achieved by cutting the same number of seeds. It is very  difficult to mechanically remove seeds that lack  gametophytic tissue, because these seeds fill with resin,  making them weigh about the same as good seed.  Stratification and Germination Tests  The most important aspect of seed quality is seed  germination. Seed germination is tested using  greenhouse rather than optimum laboratory temperature  conditions so that accurate amounts of seed can be  prepared for sowing.  The seed sample is placed into a fine mesh bag and  soaked for 48 hours in running tap water to ensure  imbibition. The mesh bags are placed into plastic bags,  and a sample of seed is stratified for each of three  periods: 14, 28, and 40 days at 33-36°F (l-2OC).  At the end of the stratification period, seed is  removed and soaked for 24 hours in running tap water.  Four 100-seed replicates of each lot for each stratification  period are placed into germination trays. Non-stratified  seed for each lot (four 100-seed replications) is also  germinated. Seed is germinated under 8 hours light at  75°F (24°0 and 16 hours dark at 65°F (18OC). Cumulative  counts are made at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. At 28 days,  any ungerminated seeds are cut to determine whether  they are hollow or sound.  Sowing Calculations  After determining which stratification period gives  the highest cumulative germination at 21 days, the total  amount of seed needed for the crop can be determined.  Using probability tables (see linus and McDonald 1979),  the number of seed needed per cell to achieve around  9S-percent cell occupancy is determined. We then  mathematically add 0.5 seed per cell to cover handling  and sowing losses. Each lot is oversown 10 percent at the  research nursery. With a given germination, desired  number of seedlings, purity, sound seed percentage, and  seeds per pound, we calculate the pounds of seed  needed as follows:  (25,000) • (1.1) • (3.5)  (19,750) • (0.95) • (0.80)  96,250  15,010  - 6.4 Ibs  The required amount of seed is placed into mesh  bags with no more than 2 pounds per bag. The seed is  strati fied as di scussed previously, using the stratification  period that gave the best germination. Experience at the  nursery shows most grand fir lots perform best with 28  days of cold stratification.  Growing Regime (Fig. 1)  Environmental Monitoring  The basic environmental factors are minimum and  maximum air temperatures, medium temperature,  humidity, and the pH and electrical conductivity of  irrigation water, fertigation water (irrigation water with  injected liquid fertil izer in solution), and leachate from  the growing medium.

Four maximum/minimum thermometers are  distributed in each greenhouse to record the daily  temperature range. A hygrothermograph charts the  temperature and relative humidity patterns weekly.  Medium temperatures are obtained with a soil  thermometer. Irrigation and fertigation water are  monitored to keep the applied solution between pH 5.5  and 6.0. Growing medium leachate is also monitored to  detect increases in medium pH. Leachate conductivity  will indicate any serious increases in salt accumulation  within the medium that may become detrimental to the  seed lings. Tinus and McDonald (1979) discuss these  topics and instruments in great detail, including calibra­tion  of hygrothermographs.  Desired Seedling Characteristics  Outplanting data for grand fir indicate the need for  seed lings with large root collar diameters (caliper), well­formed  buds, high root growth potential, and a low ratio  between shoot and root dry weights. This regime  produces seedlings averaging 15 em in height, 2.3 to 2.8  mm in caliper, with well-formed buds and high root  growth potential.  Container Type, Growing Medium,  and Tray Filling  Grand fir is grown in 4-cubic-inch Ray Leach Pine  Cells, which have 200 cells per tray or 100 cells per  square foot. Seedlings can also be grown in styrofoam  containers. In general, seedlings with larger root collar  diameters will be produced in containers with wider  spaces between cells. Before seeds are sown, previously  used trays and cells are thoroughly washed and dipped  into a 1G-percent bleach solution (1 part laundry bleach  to 9 parts water). After the trays and cells have dried, the  bottom 1 inch of the cells is remoistened with tap water,  and the tray and cells are run through the filling ma­chine.

The pH of  this mix averages around 4.2. Seeds are sown with a  vacuum seeder and covered with about 1/5- to 3/8-inch  of either Target Forestry Sand""' or washed wh ite grit.  Germination Phase  Once sowing is complete, the containers are  irrigated until the medium is thoroughly moist.  Phosphoric acid is injected into the irrigation water to  adjust pH to around 6.0. Light mists of acidified irrigation  water are appl ied to keep the zone around the  germinating seeds slightly moist. Vigorous lots of grand  fir show through the grit in as little as three days.  Some germinants may show symptoms of damping­off  fungi. Common fungi associated with damping-off  include Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytopthora, and  Fusarium. Symptoms of damping-off are rotted stems at  the groundline, often accompanied by apparently healthy  tops lying on their sides. The infected germinants, and  preferably their cells, should be removed from the  greenhouse to prevent disease spread. Irrigation water  can cause spores to splash to other seedlings, thereby  spreading the disease. Disease incidence declines as  soon as the stems begin to lignify, generally in three to  four weeks (Tinus and McDonald 1979).  At the research nursery we rely on these proper  cultural practices to reduce damping-off: maintaining low  medium pH with acidified irrigation water, using grit to  allow air circulation around the root collar zone, keeping  relative humidity low, delaying nitrogen fertilization until  germination is complete, and using medium fungicide  drenches. We apply one dose of the fungicide Banrol""'  (a soil drench) at 4 ounces per 100 gallons immediately  after germination is complete as a preventative method  agai nst root rots.  Germination is generally complete within 14 to 21  days, and seed coats are shed within 28 days. Cells are  thinned to one seedling each by removing the extra  germinants with tweezers or fingers as soon as the  majority of seedlings have shed their seed coats. Seed lots  with high germination energy tend to shed their seed  coats rapidly. During seed coat shed, at about week 2,  seedlings enter the ""initial growth phase:'  Initial Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to develop root systems  on the germinants, making them capable of incorporating  large amounts of nutrients and producing rapid shoot  growth during the accelerated growth phase. Large  concentrations of phosphorus and potassium are applied  to achieve the desired growth.  Nutrients are applied during each twice-weekly  irrigation to meet targeted growth (Fig. 2 and 3). During  the initial growth phase, week 2 through week 6, we  4  inject a liquid fertilizer solution of Peters Conifer  Starter® (7-40-17) at a rate of 84 ppm N and calcium  nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at a rate of 46 ppm N supplemented  with phosphoric acid to adjust fertigation water pH to  below 6.0 (Table 1).  During this growth phase day temperatures of  75-80DF (24-27DC) and night temperatures around 65DF  (18DC) are maintained. Medium temperature (recorded at  8 a.m. daily) averages 68DF (20DC). Photoperiod is  extended to 18 hours. At the end of week 6 the medium  is leached with copious amounts of irrigation water to  remove any salt build-up prior to beginning the  accelerated growth phase. During week 6, seed ling fol i­age  samples are sent to a commercial laboratory for nu­trient  analysis.  Weather conditions, particularly the amount of  sunshine, have a strong influence on initial growth of  seedlings. Weekly height and caliper measurements are  taken on ten pre-determined sample trees within each  lot. If height growth is exceeding target levels, we reduce  nitrogen by lowering the rate of calcium nitrate in the  fertilizer solution to around 23 ppm. Conversely, if  growth is behind targeted levels, we apply additional  nitrogen by increasing the rate of calcium nitrate to as  much as 69 ppm.  During th is phase, seed lings may show symptoms of  Fusarium root rot: chlorotic needles that turn necrotic,  resulting in the seedlings turning brown to red-brown  and dying. The seedling tip may also wilt into a  shepherd's crook. Infected seedlings and cells should be  removed as soon as evident.  Accelerated Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to achieve target seed­ling  height while increasing root collar diameter. This  phase begins during the seventh week. Levels of  phosphorus and potassium are reduced and nitrogen  concentrations increased to promote shoot growth.  Peters Conifer Grower® (20-7-19) is the main  fe rtil izer, applied at 120 ppm N, supplemented with  calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at 46 ppm N, micronutrients,  and phosphoric acid (Table 2). Nutrients are still applied  during the twice-weekly irrigation s. Photoperiod and  temperatures are the same as for the initial growth phase.  Seedling heights are compared with heights on the  target height growth curve, and if heights exceed targets,  nitrogen is reduced by decreasing the rate of calcium  nitrate in the fertilizer solution to 23 ppm N. Conversely,  if growth is lagging behind the target level, calcium  nitrate can be applied at 69 ppm N.  During week 12, if height growth is at the desired  level, the medium is leached with copious amounts of  irrigation water to remove any salt build-up and excessive  fertilizer. The medium is then allowed to dry down until  it is barely moist. If the seedlings are shorter than the  target height, fertilizer calcium nitrate levels are  14  13  12  11  10 (Moisture stress and bud initiation  9  ~ 8  U  Z 7 Accelerated growth phase  ~ J: 6  \j  il:l 5  J:  4  I nitial growth phase  3  2  0  0 2 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22  WEEKS  Figure 2.

Foliage is again tested for nutrient deficiencies at  this time.  Bud Initiation and  Root Collar Diameter Growth  The objective of this phase is to withhold nutrients  and moisture, creating stress in the seedlings so that  height growth will cease, terminal buds will develop, and  root collar diameter will increase. During this growth  phase, the seedlings are taken off the twice-weekly  irrigationlfertilization schedule. Levels of applied nitrogen  are reduced, and phosphorus and potassium levels are  increased.  Seedlings are now irrigated only when the medium  has become barely moist. Our greenhouse technicians  daily select seedlings at random, remove the root plugs  from the cells, and inspect and feel the medium for  dryness. Although the method is quite subjective, we feel  it has some advantages. Disease and insects can be  surveyed at the same time, and, because of random  selection, the seedlings that are seldom examined  because of inaccessibility also are checked. By  inspecting the root plugs, we also gain some insight into  how the root system is developing.  Table 3. Fertilizer target levels for bud initiation phase.

Micronutrients, calcium  nitrate, and phosphoric acid are applied during each  irrigation, and the conifer finisher is applied every other  irrigation.  The extended photoperiod is discontinued. Day  temperatures are set for 60-700F (16-21°C) and night  temperatures for 50-60°F (10-16°C). We maintain medium  temperatures between 62°F and 68°F (17-20°C) within  these air temperature ranges.  Cold-Hardiness Induction Phase  The objective of this phase is to physiologically  prepare the trees for freezing temperatures. We  accomplish this by subjecting the trees to ambient  temperatures and thus allowing normal cold-hardiness to  develop. The grand fir may appear slightly chlorotic, and  in some lots they may begin to show a purplish color in  their needles and stems as an indicator of carbohydrate  accumulation and the beginning of physiological changes  preparing the seedlings for winter.

However, the minimum temperature  allowed in the greenhouses is 28°F (-2OC), and the root  plug is not allowed to remain frozen. Temperatures  remain about ambient until the seedlings are packed for  cold storage in January. From late Odober until the trees  are put into cold storage, irrigation is necessary only  about once every three to four weeks. During these  irrigations, fertilizer is applied at accelerated growth  phase rates. The fertilizer ads as a nutrient reserve within  the medium for use by the tree when outplanted.  Extraction and Cold Storage  Seedlings are well watered before being removed  from their containers and wrapped with a Saran-like  plastic in bundles of 25. The stickiness of the plastic  keeps the bundle firmly packed, which maintains plug  integrity and prevents moisture loss. Bundles of trees for  public conservation sales are placed four to a poly bag  (100 seedlings total), which is sealed before going into  refrigerated storage. Bundles of trees for large  reforestation working agreements are placed into poly­lined  wax boxes, which are also sealed air-tight before  being placed into cold storage. The refrigerated storage  area is kept at 33-34°F (0.5-1°C) with relative humidity  near 100 percent. Seedlings have been stored  successfully in this manner for five months without  needing irrigation.  Seedlings in cold storage are routinely inspected for  disease problems. The most serious disease is caused by  fungi of the genus Botryt;s. The symptoms are webs of  gray to gray-brown mycelium growing through the tops of  the seedlings, especially in the center of bundles. Tan or  brown-watery stem lesions may also be present.  Preventative methods are best for controlling this prob­lem  and include the following: (1) pulling, wrapping, and  storing only vigorous, disease-free seedlings, (2) storing  seedlings for the shortest time possible, (3) routinely  inspeding a sample from each lot, especially lots  containing significant quantities of dead needles that can  serve as an initial food base for the pathogen, and (4)  shipping seedlings showing mold problems immediately,  if possible (Sutherland and Van Eerden 1980). Mold  8  growth can also be reduced by dropping the storage  temperature for fully hardened seedlings to below  freezing.  Conclusions  This regime has been very successful. Requested  quantities of seedlings meeting strid physiological and  morphological requirements are achieved or exceeded  with a minimum oversow. Seedlings grown under this  regime average 15 cm in height and 2.3 to 2.8 mm in  caliper.  We feel the most important asped of any growing  regime is continually monitoring seedling growth as the  regime progresses. Height and caliper measurements can  then be used to modify or change the regime during one  growing season or between growing seasons. This regime  was developed from six years of records on fertilizer  application rates and resultant seedling growth, and will  certainly be modified in the pursuit of high-quality grand  fir seedlings.  literature Cited  Franklin, J.F. 1974.

Wenny  R. Kasten Dumroese  Introduction  The University of Idaho, College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences operates a research nursery produc­ing  925,000 container-grown seedlings annually. The fa­cility  serves as a laboratory and offers practical  experience to students in agriculture, forestry and forest  nursery management. Reforestation seed lings produced at  the nursery are annually planted on state lands, private  forest industry lands and on the University of Idaho Ex­perimental  Forest. Field data on outplanted seedlings,  coupled with detailed crop histories maintained by the  nursery, produce feedback for future crops. Microcom­puters  are used to monitor seedling development and  guide cultural practices yielding seedlings with high sur­vivability  and growth.  Western Redcedar  Western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn) is an impor­tant  species in the Inland Empire for specialty wood  products. Redcedar occurs along the coast from south­eastern  Alaska to northern California, throughout the  Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon, and in  the Rocky Mountains of northern Idaho, western Mon­tana  and British Columbia (Schopmeyer 1974). In north­ern  Idaho, this species occurs in mixed stands with  Douglas-fir, western white pine, western larch, western  hernlock, grand fir and Engelmann spruce. Western  redcedar grows best on moist flats and slopes and along  rivers and streams (Harlow et al. 1979). Tree heights aver­age  150 to 200 feet (30 to 66 m) and stems are 4 to 8  feet (1.2 to 2.5 m) in diameter at breast height.  This conifer begins to bear cones around 20 years of  age, usually producing small crops annually and large  crops every three to four years. Seeds per pound for  northern Idaho western redcedar range from 300,000 to  500,000, with a mean around 430,000 (661,500 to  1,102,500 with a mean of 948,000 seeds per kilogram).  Western redcedar has been cultivated since 1853  (Schopmeyer 1974). The following is a synopsis of the  UNIVfRSlTY OF IBAHO LIBRARY  methodology used at the University of Idaho Forest Re­search  Nursery to produce container-grown western  redcedar seedlings for research, conservation, and  reforestation.  The Forest Research Nursery  Seedlings are grown in two 34- by 108-foot (10- by  33-m) fiberglass greenhouses, and one 30- by 96-foot (9-  by 29-m) double-poly greenhouse, all connected by a  head house. Each greenhouse is heated by two natural  gas heaters and vented with two 48-inch (122-cm) ex­haust  fan and louver systems. Two 24-inch (61-cm) ven­tilating  fans provide air and heat circulation through  poly-tubes placed beneath the growing benches in each  house. We feel poly-tubes placed in this manner rather  than overhead aid in air circulation and drying beneath  the benches and allow supplemental heat to rise through  the trays. Recent research also indicates this reduces  foliar disease incidence (Peterson and Sutherland 1989).  An evaporative cooling system and shutters along the  north side of the facility are used for cooling. Photoperi­od  is extended by incandescent lamps at an intensity of  500-lux.  The pH of the well water averages 6.8. Irrigation is  applied through an overhead travelling boom system with  nozzles every 8 inches (20 cm). We generally sow  numerous small lots of several species, and the boom al­lows  us to give specific irrigation, fertilization and pesti­cide  attention to the individual lots. Fertilizers and  pesticides are applied through the irrigation water by us­ing  a 1:100 injector.  Seed Quality Tests  Each lot of seed to be grown is evaluated upon re­ceipt  for quality. The evaluation includes seeds per  pound, purity percentage, soundness, and germination.  Seeds per Pound  Seeds per pound are calculated by weighing five  replications of 100 seeds to the nearest 0.01 grams. The  mean weight is then placed into this equation:  Seeds per pound _ ___- --,-__45- ..:,_36_0_-,-___  mean weight in grams of 100 seeds  Seeds per ki log ram - mean weight in grams of 100  seeds x 1000  Purity is determined by removing the ""debris"" from  an 3-gram (2500-seed) sample of seed. Western redcedar  seed is difficult to clean during processing, but should­have  at least 85-percent purity.  Purity % -  clean seed wt.  x 100  clean seed wt. + debris wt.  I  I I  Sowing Calculations  After determining cumulative germination at 14 days,  the total amount of seed needed for the crop can be de­termined.  Using probability tables (see linus and  McDonald 1979), the number of seed needed per cell to  achieve around 95-percent cell occupancy is determined.  We then mathematically add 0.5 seed per cell to cover  handling and sowing losses. Each lot is oversown 10 per­cent  at the research nursery. With the given germination,  the desired number of seedlings, purity, sound seed per­centage,  and seeds per pound, we can calculate the  pounds of seed needed as follows:  (Desired seedlings) x (Oversow factor) x (Seeds per cell)  (Seeds per pound) x (Purity percent) x (Soundness percent)  Example:  With 70-percent germination, from the probability ta­bles  we find that 3 seeds per cell will give us 96 percent  of the cells filled. To make sure we have enough seed to  account for handling and sowing loses, we add 0.5 seed  per cell for an average of 3.5 seeds per cell.  Given: 430,000 seeds per pound (948,000 seeds per kg),  85-percent purity, 80-percent soundness, 25,000  trees desired and 10 percent oversow.  (25,000) x (1.1) x (3.5)  (430,000) x (0.85) x (0.80)  (25,000) x (1.1) x (3.5)  (948,000) x (0.85) x (0.80)  Soundness Percentage  96,250  292,400  - 0.149 kg  - 0.33 Ibs.  The percentage of hollow seeds is determined by  x-raying a 100- to 200-seed sample. This could also be  achieved by cutting the same number of seed.  Stratification and Germination Tests  ed. Seed is germinated under 8 hours light at 75°F  (24°C) and 16 hours dark at 65°F (18°C). Cumulative  counts are made at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. At 28 days,  any ungerminated seed are cut to determine if they are  hollow or sound. .  Most often, western redcedar germinates best with­out  a stratification treatment.  Growing Regime (Fig. 1)  Environmental Monitoring  The basic environmental factors are minimum and  maximum temperature, medium temperature, humidity,  and the pH and electrical conductivity of irrigation, ferti­gation  water (irrigation water with injected liquid fertiliz­er  in solution), and leachate from the growing medium.

Seed is placed into fine mesh bags and soaked 48  hours with running tap water to ensure imbibition.

Medium temperatures are obtained with a soil thermom­eter.  Irrigation and fertigation water are monitored to  keep the applied solution between pH 5.5 and 6.0.  Growing medium leachate is also monitored to detect in­creases  in medium pH. Leachate conductivity will indi­cate  any serious increases in salt accumulation within  the medium that may become detrimental to the seed­lings.  Tinus and McDonald (1979) discuss these topics  and instruments in great detail, including calibration of  hygrothermographs.  Desired Seedling Characteristics  Outplanting data for western redcedar indicate the  need for seedlings with large root collar diameters (cali-per),  high root growth potential and a low ratio between  shoot and root dry weights. This regime produces seed­lings  averaging 20 cm in height, around 2.5 mm in cali­per  and high root growth potential. Many Idaho sites  may be subjected to three months of drought after the  seedlings are planted. We feel the short heights rendered  by this regime are a distinct advantage to plantation  success.  Container Type, Growing Medium, and Tray  Filling  Western redcedar is grown in 4-cubic-inch Ray Leach  Pine Cells, which have 200 cells per tray or 100 cells per  square foot. Seedlings can also be produced in styrofoam  containers. In general, seedlings with larger root collar  diameters can be produced in containers with wider  spacing between cells. Before sowing, previously used  trays and cells are thoroughly washed and dipped into a  July August September October November December January February  12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43  Root collar diameter growth  60-70 50-60  50-60 45-55  74  /I  84 68  II  57  50 50 42 36  None  Irrigate when rootplug is barely moist.

After the trays and cells have dried, the bot­tom  1 inch of the cells is remoistened with tap water  and the tray and cells run through the filling machine.  Moistening the bottom of the cells causes dry growing  medium to adhere and not fall through the drainage  holes. Cells are machine-filled with a peat-vermiculite  (1:1) growing medium. The pH of this mix averages  around 4.2. Seeds are sown with an optical precision  seeder and just barely covered with washed white grit.  Germination Phase  Once sowing is complete, the containers are irrigat­ed  until the medium is thoroughly moist. Phosphoric  acid is injected into the irrigation water to adjust pH to  around 6.0. Light mists of acidified irrigation water are  applied to keep the zone around the germinating seeds  slightly moist.  Western redcedar is rarely troubled by damping-off  fungi . Common fungi associated with damping-off in­clude  Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytopthora, and Fusarium.  Symptoms of damping-off are rotted stems at the ground­line,  often with an apparently healthy top lying on its  side. The germinant, and preferably the entire cell,  should be removed from the greenhouse to prevent dis­ease  spread. Irrigation water can cause spores to splash  to other seedlings, thereby spreading the disease. Disease  incidence declines as soon as the stems begin to lignify,  generally in 3 to 4 weeks (linus and McDonald 1979). At  the research nursery, we rely on these proper cultural  practices to reduce damping-off: maintaining low medi­um  pH with acidified irrigation water, using grit to allow  air circulation around the root collar zone, keeping rela­tive  humidity low, and delaying nitrogen fertilization until  germination is complete.  Cells are thinned to one seedling by removing the  extra germinants with tweezers or fingers as soon as the  majority of seedlings have shed their seedcoats. Thinning  is more efficient if done before lateral root development.  Germination is generally complete within 14 to 21  days, at which time the seedlings enter the ""initial  growth phase:'  Initial Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to develop root systems  on the germinants. Large concentrations of phosphorous  and potassium are applied to achieve the desired growth.  Nutrients are applied during each twice-weekly irri­gation  to meet targeted growth (Fig. 2). During the initial  growth phase, week 3 through week 6, we inject a liquid  fertilizer solution of Peters Conifer Starter'"" (7-40·17) at a  rate of 42 ppm N supplemented with micronutrients and  phosphoric acid to adjust fertigation water pH to below  6.0 (Table 1).  During this growth phase, day temperatures of  7S·800F (24·27°C) and night temperatures around 650F  4  (18°C) are maintained. Medium temperature (recorded at  8 am daily) averages 68°F (20°C). Photoperiod is extend·  ed to 18 hours. At the end of week 6, the medium is  leached with copious amounts of irrigation water to re­move  any salt build·up. Also, during week 6, seedling fo­liage  is tested for nutrient concentrations to detect any  deficiencies.  Accelerated Growth Phase  Between weeks 7 and 11, we may add Peters Conifer  Grower'"" (20·7·19) applied at 120 ppm N, trying to keep  seedling height growth on target (Fig. 2). Seedlings are  removed from the twice-weekly irrigation/fertilization  schedule. Seedlings are now irrigated only when medi·  um has become barely moist. Our greenhouse techni·  cians daily select seedlings at random, remove the  rootplug from the cell, and visually examine and feel the  medium for dryness. Although quite subjective, we feel  this method has some advantages. One advantage is that  disease and insects can be surveyed at the same time;  and by random selection, the seedlings that are seldom  examined because of inaccessibility are also checked. By  inspecting the root plug, we also gain some insight as to  how the root system is developing.  Weather conditions, particularly the amount of sun·  shine, have a strong influence on initial growth of seed·  lings. Weekly height and root collar diameter (caliper)  measurements are taken on ten pre-determined sample.  trees within each lot (Fig. 2, 3).  Usually, infrequent fertilizer applications result in  rapid growth, so continual monitoring of the crop is im·  perative. If seedling height growth exceeds target levels,  seedlings receive only micronutrients.  Root Collar Diameter Growth Phase  Starting with week 12, the extended photoperiod is  discontinued. Day temperatures are set for 60-700F  (16-21°C) and night temperatures of 50·600F (10-160C). We  maintain medium temperatures between 62·68°F  (17·200C) with these air temperature ranges. Seedlings  now receive calcium nitrate at a rate of 46 ppm instead  of grower, alternated with micronutrients.  Western redcedar continue to grow until stopped by  cold temperatures, so it is important to monitor growth  and compare it against targeted levels.  Cold·Hardiness Induction Phase  The objective of this phase is to prepare the trees  physiologically for freezing temperatures. We accomplish  this by subjecting the trees to ambient temperatures, thus  allOWing normal cold·hardiness to develop. The western  redcedar will look slightly bronzed. As early as the first  of October, lots may begin to show a purplish color as  an indicator of carbohydrate accumulation and the begin­ning  of physiological changes preparing the seedling for  winter.  3.0  2.8  2.6  2.4  2.0  ~  ~  1.8  Z 1.6 .. 1.4  .'."". :::; 1.2  ~ 1.0  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0.0  o 2 4  ~  U  Z  ~  J:  U  u:;  J:  22  20  18  16  14  12  10  8  Continued natural  hardening  6  Accelerated growth phase  4  2  0  o 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30  WEEKS  Figure 2.

(46 ppm N).  6  l  Beginning around mid-Odober, we allow air temper­atures  within the greenhouses to go to ambient (Fig. 1).  Temperatures remain about ambient until the seedlings  are packed for cold storage in January. However, the  minimum temperature allowed in the greenhouses is  28°F (2°C) and the rootplug is not allowed to remain fro­zen.  From late October until the trees are put into cold  storage, irrigation is only necessary about once every  three to four weeks. During these irrigations, calcium ni­trate  is applied at a rate of 46 ppm N.  Extraction and Cold Storage  Seedlings are well watered before being removed  from their containers and placed in plastic bags in  groups of 20. Bundles of trees for public conservation  sales are placed five to a poly bag (100 seedlings total),  which is sealed before going to refrigerated storage. Bun­dles  of trees for large reforestation working agreements  are placed into poly-lined wax boxes that are also sealed  air-tight before placing in cold storage. The refrigerated  storage is kept at 33-34°F (0.5-1°C), with relative humidity  near 100 percent. Seedlings have been stored successful­ly  in this manner for 5 months without the need for irri­gation.  Seedlings in cold storage are routinely inspected for  disease problems. Botryt;s is the most serious disease.  Preventative methods are the best way to control this  problem and include the following: (1) only pull and  store vigorous, disease-free seed lings, (2) store seed lings  for the shortest duration possible, (3) routinely insped a  sample of each lot, (4) immediately ship seedlings show­ing  mold problems, if possible (Sutherland and Van Eer­den  1980). Mold growth can also be reduced by  dropping the storage temperature for fully hardened  seed lings to below freezing.  Conclusion  This regime has been very successfu!' Requested  quantities of seedlings meeting strict physiological and  morphological requirements are achieved or exceeded  with· a minimum oversow. Seedlings grown under this  regime average 20 cm in height and around 2.5 mm in  caliper. First-year outplanting survival has exceeded 94  percent each of the past six years, and seed lings are 35  to 45 cm tall after one growing season. We feel the most  important aspect of any growing regime is continually  monitoring the seedling growth as the regime progresses.  Height and caliper measurements can then be used to  modify or change the regime as the growth of the seed­lings  dictates during one growing season and between  growing seasons. This regime has been developed from  eight years of records on ferti lizer application rates and  the resultant seed ling growth, and will certainly be modi­fied  in the pursuit of high-quality western redcedar  seed lings.

Wenny  R. Kasten Dumroese  Introduction  The University of Idaho Col lege of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences operates a research nursery produc­ing  925,000 container-grown seedlings annually. The fa­cility  serves as a laboratory and offers practical  experience to students in agriculture, forestry and forest  nursery management.  Three spruce species are annually grown at the facili­ty:  Engelmann, Colorado blue, and Norway. Engelmann  spruce is grown primarily for reforestation, and seedlings  are annually planted on state lands, private forest indus­try  lands, and on the University of Idaho Experimental  Forest. Blue and Norway spruce seed lings are planted for  conservation purposes throughout Idaho. Field data on  outplanted seedlings, coupled with detailed crop histo­ries  maintained by the nursery, produce feedback for fu­ture  crops. Microcomputers help monitor seedling  development and guide cu ltural practices, yielding seed­lings  with high survivability and growth.  Engelmann, Colorado Blue,  and Norway Spruce  Engelmann spruce (Picea enge/mannii Parry ex En­gelm.),  an Idaho native, reaches its maximum size on  deep, rich, loamy soils of high moisture content. Engel­mann  spruce can occur in pure stands, or in mixed  stands in northern Idaho with Douglas-fir, subalpine fir,  western hemlock, and western white pine (Harlow et al.  1979). This tree can attain a height of 100 feet (30 m)  and a diameter of 18 to 30 inches (45 to 76 cm).  Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.)  ranges from northwestern and central Utah south along  the mountains to south-central New Mexico and south­eastern  Arizona. Blue spruce is widely grown for conser­vation  and ornamental plantings. This tree can reach  heights of 70 to 90 feet (21 to 27 m) and 2 feet (61 cm)  in diameter (Harlow et al. 1979).  Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) is native to Eu­rope,  but has been planted extensively for conservation  and timber production. This species is extremely hardy  and wind resistant, with fast growth to 100 feet (30 m).  As Norway spruce matures, its youthful pyramidal growth  is replaced with strongly drooping branch lets.  Engelmann and blue spruce begin to bear cones  around 20 years of age, but Norway spruce may take  30 to 50 years to bear cones. Seeds per pound for north­ern  Idaho Engelmann spruce range from 150,000 to  225,800 with a mean of 175,000 (330,750 to 497,900  with a mean of 385,900 seeds per kilogram). Blue spruce  averages 100,000 seeds per pound, while it takes an aver­age  of 64,000 Norway spruce seeds to weigh one pound  (220,500 and 141,100 seeds per kilogram, respectively;  Safford 1974).  Norway spruce has been in cu ltivation for over 400  years, while blue and Engelmann spruce have been  grown since 1862 (Safford 1974). The follOWing is a syn­opsis  of the methodology used at the University of Idaho  Forest Research Nursery to produce container-grown  spruce seedl ings for research, conservation, and  reforestation.  The Forest Research Nursery  Seedlings are grown in two 34- by 108-foot (10- by33-  m) fiberglass greenhouses, and one 30- by 96-foot (9-by  29-m) double-poly greenhouse, all conneded by a head  house. Each greenhouse is heated by two natural gas  heaters, and vented with two 48-inch (122-cm) exhaust  fan and louver systems. Two 24-inch (61-cm) ventilating  fans provide air and heat circulation through poly-tubes  placed beneath the growing benches in each house. We  feel poly-tubes placed in this manner, rather than over­head,  aid in air circulation and drying beneath the  benches and allow supplemental heat to rise through the  trays. Recent research also indicates that this reduces  foliar disease incidence (Peterson and Sutherland 1990).  An evaporative cooling system and shutters along the  north side of the facility are used for cooling. Photoperi­od  is extended by incandescent lamps at an intensity of  500 lux.  The pH of the well water averages 6.8. Irrigation is  applied through an overhead travelling boom system with  nozzles every 8 inches (20 cm). We generally sow  numerous small lots of several species, and the boom al­lows  us to give specific irrigation, fertilization, and pesti­cide  attention to the individual lots. Fertilizers and  pesticides are applied through the irrigation water using  a 1:100 injedor.  Seed Quality Tests  Each lot of seed is eva I uated for qual ity upon re­ceipt.  The evaluation determines seeds per pound, purity  percentage, soundness, and germination.  Seeds Per Pound  Seeds per pound are calcu lated by weighing five  replications of 100 seeds to the nearest 0.D1 grams. The  mean weight is then placed into this equation:  Seeds per pound - 45,360  mean weight in grams of 100 seeds  Seeds per kilogram - mean weight in grams of 100  seeds. 1000  Purity Percentage  Purity is determined by removing the ""debris"" from a  10-gram (blue and Engelmann) or a 20-gram (Norway)  (2500-seed) sample. Spruce should be cleaned during  processing and exhibit at least 95-percent purity.  clean seed weight  Purity % - -.,. ___ ,--..,...,-_=-::..,-.,-_--,._. 100  clean seed weight + debris weight  Soundness Percentage  The percentage of hollow seeds is determined by X­raying  a 100- to 200-seed sample. This cou ld also be  cent cell occupancy is determined. We then mathemati­cally  add 0.5 seed per cell to cover handling and sowi ng  losses. Each lot is oversown 10 percent at the research  nursery. With a given germination, the desired number of  seedlings, purity, sound seed percentage, and seeds per  pound, we calcu late the pounds of seed needed as  follows:  (desired seedlings) • (oversow factor) • (seeds per cell)  (seeds per pound) • (purity percen~ • (soundness percent)  Example:  For Engelmann spruce with 88-percent germination,  we find from the probability tables that 2 seeds per cell  will give us 99 percent of the cells filled. To make sure  we have enough seed to account for handling and sow­ing  losses, we add 0.5 seed per cell for an average of 2.5  seeds per cell.  Figure 1.

If more W eek -1 o 1 23456 7891011  than 5 percent of the seeds are hollow, the seed lot  should be reprocessed by pneumatic or gravity means to  eliminate the empty seeds. G  Stratification and Germination Tests  The most important aspect of seed quality is how  well the seed wi ll germinate. Seed germination is tested  using greenhouse rather than optimum laboratory tem­peratu  re conditions so that accurate amounts of seed can  be prepared for sowi ng.  o  N  rowth Stage  ay Temp  ight Temp  Sow Germ.  75-85  65-70  The seed sample is placed into a fine mesh bag and Max 55  soaked 48 hours with running tap water to ensure imbi­bi  tion. The mesh bags are placed into plastic bags and a  sample of seed is strati fied for 28 days at 33-36°F (1-200.  Outside Temp II  Min 34  At the end of the stratification period, seed is re­moved  and soaked 24 hours in running tap water. Four  100-seed replicates of each strati fied lot are placed into  germination trays. Non-stratified seed for each lot (four  100-seed replications) are also germinated. Seed are ger­minated  under 8 hours light at 75°F (24°C) and 16 hours  dark at 65°F (18°C). Cumulative counts are made at 7, 14,  21, and 28 days. At 28 days, any ungerminated seed are  cut to determine if they are hollow or sound.  Sowing Calculations  After determining which treatment gives the highest  cumulative germination at 21 days, the total amount of  seed needed for the crop can be determined.

The  seed mayor may not be stratified as discussed previous­ly,  depending on which treatment gave the best germina­tion.  Experience at the nursery shows that many blue  and Norway spruce lots perform best without strati fica-tion,  while Engelmann spruce seems to benefit from 28  days of cold stratification.  Growing Regime (Fig. 1)  Environmental Monitoring  The basic environmental factors are minimum and  maximum temperature, medium temperature, humidity,  and the pH and electrical conductivity of irrigation water,  fertigation water (irrigation water with injected liquid fer­tilizer  in solution), and leachate from the growing  medium.

Irrigation and fertigation water are monitored to  keep the appl ied sol ution between pH 5.5 and 6.0.  Growing medium leachate is also monitored to detect in­creases  in medium pH. Leachate conductivity will indi­cate  any serious increases in salt accumulation within  the medium that may become detrimental to the seed­lings.  Tinus and McDonald (l979) discuss these topics  and instruments in great detail, including calibration of  hygrothermographs.  Desired Seedling Characteristics  Outplanting data for spruce indicates the need for  seedlings with large root collar diameters (caliper), well­formed  buds, high root growth potential, and a low ratio  between shoot and root dry weights. This regime  produces blue and Engelmann spruce seedlings averaging  15 cm in height and 20 cm for Norway spruce; all three  species have caliper between 2.5 to 2.8 mm, well-formed  buds, and high root growth potential.  Container Type, Growing Medium, and Tray  Filling  Spruce are grown in 4-cubic-inch Ray Leach® Pine  Cells which have 200 cells per tray or 100 cells per  square foot. Seedlings can also be produced in styrofoam  containers. In general, seedlings with larger root collar  diameters can be produced in containers with wider  spacing between cells. Before sowing, previously used  trays and cells are thoroughly washed and dipped into a  10-percent bleach solution (one part laundry bleach to 9  parts water). After the trays and cells have dried, the bot­tom  1 inch of the cells is re-moistened with tap water  and the tray and cells are run through the filling ma­chine.  Moistening the bottom of the cells causes dry  growing medium to adhere and not fall through the  drainage holes. Cells are machine-filled with a peat­vermiculite  (1:1) growing medium. The pH of this mix  averages about 4.2. Seeds are sown with an optical preci­sion  seeder and just barely covered with washed white  grit.  Germination Phase  Once sowing is complete, the containers are irrigat­ed  until the medium is thoroughly moist. Phosphoric  acid is injected into the irrigation water to adjust pH to  about 6.0. Light mists of acidified irrigation water are ap­plied  to keep the zone around the germinating seeds  slightly moist.  Some germinants may show symptoms of damping­off  fungi. Common fungi associated with damping-off in­clude  Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytopthora, and FU5arium.  Symptoms of damping-off are rotted stems at the ground­line,  often with an apparently healthy top lying on its  side. The germinant, and preferably the entire cell,  should be removed from the greenhouse to prevent dis­ease  spread. Irrigation water can cause spores to splash  4  to other seedlings, thereby spreading the disease. Disease  incidence declines as soon as the stems begin to lignify,  generally in three to four weeks (linus and McDonald  1979). At the research nursery we rely on these proper  cultural practices to reduce damping-off: maintaining low  medium pH with acidified irrigation water, using grit to  allow air circulation around the root collar zone, keeping  relative humidity low, and delaying nitrogen fertilization  until germination is complete.  Once sowing is complete, the crop is monitored  daily for problems. Damped-off seedlings are immediate­ly  rogued and tallied by species and seed lot. If damping­off  passes our damage threshold level (at least 15% of  the blocks within the seedlot have 3-5% of their cells  with disease), fungicide is applied to the problem seed­lot.  Thinning crews also rogue diseased seedlings and  help with monitoring. The process of roguing dead or  dying seedlings continues until the seedlings are extract­ed,  and is facilitated by rolling benches which allow  convenient access to all trays. We feel roguing is espe­cially  important in removing potential hosts for Botryti5  and for minimizing FU5arium and other pathogen inocu­lum  build-up in our containers (Dumroese et al. 1990). If  the damage threshold is passed, we apply the fungicide  Banrot""' (a soil drench) at 4 ounces per 100 gallons as  necessary.  Germination is generally complete within 21 to 28  days. Cells are thinned to one seedling by removing the  extra germinants with tweezers or fingers as soon as the  majority of seedlings have shed their seedcoats. Seedlots  with high germination energy tend to shed their seed­coats  rapidly. During seedcoat shed (about week 2),  seed lings enter the ""initial growth phase:'  Initial Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to develop root systems  on the germinants, making them capable of incorporating  large amounts of nutrients and producing rapid shoot  growth during the accelerated growth phase. Large con­centrations  of phosphorous and potassium are applied to  achieve the desired growth.  Nutrients are applied during each twice-weekly irri­gation  to meet targeted growth (Figs. 2 and 3). During  the initial growth phase, week 3 through week 6, we in­ject  a liquid ferti lizer solution of Peters Conifer Starte~  (7-40-17) at a rate of 42 ppm N supplemented with  micronutrients and phosphoric acid to adjust fertigation  water pH to below 6.0 (Table 1).  During this growth phase, day temperatures of  75-800F (24-27°C) and night temperatures around 65°F  (l80C) are maintained. Medium temperature (recorded at  8 a.m. daily) averages 68°F (20°C). Photoperiod is ex­tended  to 18 hours. At the end of week 6, the medium is  leached with copious amounts of irrigation water to re­move  any salt build-up prior to beginning the accelerated  growth phase. Also during week 6, seedling foliage is  tested for nutrient concentrations to detect any defi­ciencies.  •  3.0  2.8  2.6  2.4  ~ 2.0  ~  1.8  Z  .c.o.:. 1.6 .... 1.4  ::::;  &lt;: 1.2  U  1.0  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0.0  o  ~  U  Z  to-  J:  \.?  i:i:j  J:  20 ,------------------------------------------------------,  18  16  14  12  10  8  6  4  2  0  o Blue and Engelmann spruce  6 Norway spruce  o 2 4 6 8  Continued natural hardening  Accelerated growth phase  10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30  WEEKS  Figure 2.

This  phase begins during the seventh week. Levels of phos­phorous  and potassium are reduced and nitrogen con­centrations  increased to promote shoot growth.  Peters Conifer Grower'"" (20-7-19) is applied at 120  ppm N along with micronutrients and phosphoric acid.  Grower is alternated with calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at  92 ppm N and phosphoric acid (Table 2). Nutrients are  stil l applied during the twice-weekly irrigations. Photo­period  and temperatures are the same as for the initial  growth phase.  Weather conditions, particularly the amount of sun­shine,  have a strong influence on initial growth of seed­lings.  Weekly height and caliper measurements are taken  on ten pre-determined sample trees within each lot. If  height growth is occurring faster than our target growth  curve, nitrogen rates are reduced by decreasing the rate  of calcium nitrate to 46 ppm N. Conversely, if growth is  lagging behind the target level, calcium nitrate levels can  be increased.  During week 12, if height growth is at the desired  level, the medium is leached with copious amounts of ir­rigation  water to remove any salt build-up and excessive  fert ili zer. Notice that Norway spruce grows more rapidly  than the other species (Fig. 2), and may need to be  leached sooner. The medium is then allowed to dry  down until it is just barely moist. If the seed lings are be­low  target height, calcium nitrate levels are increased  and the leach postponed until the target is met. Foliage  is again tested for nutrient deficiencies at this time to  correct any shortages.  Bud Initiation and  Root Collar Diameter Growth  The objective of this phase is to withhold nutrients  and moisture, creating a stressed condition in the seed­lings  so that height growth wil l cease, terminal buds wi ll  develop, and root collar diameter wil l increase. During  th is growth phase the seed lings are removed from the  twice-weekly irrigation/fertili zation schedule. Levels of ap­plied  nitrogen are reduced and phosphorous and potassi­um  levels increased to achieve the objective.  Seedlings are now irrigated only when the medium  has become barely moist. Our greenhouse technicians  daily select seedlings at random, remove the rootplug  from the cell, and visually examine and feel the medium  for dryness. Although quite subjective, we feel this meth­od  has some advantages. One advantage is that disease  and insects can be surveyed at the same time, and by  random selection, the seedlings that are seldom exam­ined  because of inaccessibility are also checked. By in­specting  the root plug, we also gain some insight as to  how the root system is developing.  Between weeks 12 and 15 when irrigation is neces­sary,  Peters Conifer Finisher'"" (4-25-35) is the primary  fertilizer, along with micronutrients and phosphoric acid  (Table 3). After week 15, finisher is alternated with calci­um  nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at a rate of 92 ppm.  Table 3. Fertilizer target levels for bud initiation and root collar diameter growth.

The extended photoperiod is discontinued. Day tem­peratures  are set for 60-700F (16-21°C) and night tempera­tures  at 50-60°F (10-16°C). We maintain medium  temperatures between 62-68°F (17-20°C) with these air  temperature ranges.  Cold-Hardiness Induction Phase  The objective of this phase is to physiologically pre­pare  the trees for freezing temperatures. We accomplish  this by subjecting the trees to ambient temperatures and  thus allOWing normal cold hardiness to develop.  Beginning around mid-October, we allow air temper­atures  within the greenhouses to reach ambient levels  (Figure 1). However, the minimum temperature allowed  in the greenhouses is 28°F (-2°C) and the root plug is not  allowed to remain frozen. Temperatures remain about  ambient until the seedlings are packed for cold storage  in January. From late October until the trees are put into  cold storage, irrigation is necessary only about once ev­ery  three to four weeks. During these irrigations, acceler­ated  growth phase fertilizer rates are applied. These act  as a nutrient reserve within the medium for use by the  tree when outplanted.  Extraction and Cold Storage  Seedlings are well watered before being removed  from their containers and placed in plastic bags in  groups of 20. Bundles of trees for public conservation  sales are placed five to a poly-bag (100 seedlings total)  which is sealed before going to refrigerated storage. Bun­dles  of trees for large reforestation working agreements  are placed into poly-lined wax boxes which are also  sealed air-tight before being placed in cold storage. The  refrigerated storage is kept at 33-34°F (0.5-1°C). Seedlings  have been stored successfully in this manner for five  months without needing irrigation.  Seedlings in cold storage are routinely inspected for  disease problems. The most serious disease is caused by  fungi of the genus Botrytis. The symptoms include webs  of gray to gray-brown mycelium growing through the tops  of the seed lings, especially in the center of bundles. Tan  or brown-watery stem lesions may also be present.  Preventative methods are the best way to control this  problem and include the following: (1) pull, wrap, and  store only vigorous, disease-free seedlings, (2) store seed­lings  for the shortest duration possible, (3) routinely in­spect  a sample of each lot, especially lots containing sig­nificant  quantities of dead needles which can serve as an  initial food base for the pathogen, and (4) ship seedlings  8  showing mold problems immediately if possible (Suther­land  and Van Eerden 1980). Mold growth can also be  reduced by dropping the storage temperature for fully  hardened seedlings to below freezing.  Conclusions  This regime has been very successful. Requested  quantities of seedlings meeting strict physiological and  morphological requirements are achieved or exceeded  with a minimum oversow. Seedlings grown under this re­gime  average 15 to 20 cm in height and 2.5 to 2.8 mm  in caliper. We feel the most important aspect of any  growing regime is continually monitoring seedling  growth as the regime progresses. Height and caliper  measurements can then be used to modify or change the  regime as the growth of the seedlings dictates, during  one growing season and between growing seasons. This  regime has been developed from eight years of records  on fertilizer application rates and the resultant seedling  growth, and will certainly be modified in the pursuit of  high-quality spruce seedlings.

Wenny  R. Kasten Dumroese  Introduction  The University of Idaho, College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences operates a research nursery produc­ing  925,000 container-grown seedlings annually. The fa­ci  lity serves as a laboratory and offers practica l  experience to students in agriculture, forestry, and forest  nursery management.  Scotch and Austrian pine seed lings are planted  throughout Idaho for conservation purposes, as ornamen­tals,  and sometimes for Christmas trees. Field data on  outplanted seedlings, coupled with detai led crop histo­ries  maintained by the nursery, produce feedback for  future crops. Microcomputers help monitor seedling  development and guide cultural practices, yielding  seedlings with high survivability and growth.  Scotch or Scots Pine and Austrian Pine  Scotch pine, also commonly called Scots pine (Pinus  sylvestris L.) is the most widely distributed pine in the  world. This tree is very hardy and tolerant of wind and  cold, and can easily grow 70 feet (21 m) tall. For plant­ing  in the Pacific Northwest, and especially for Christmas  tree plantations, seedlings grown from the Spanish  Guadarrama and Burga strains are best. These varieties  hold their green co lor better in the winter. Another  usually good performer is French Auverge (Proebsting  and Hanley 1985).  Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) is native to south­ern  Europe. It is a very hardy tree, resistant to winter  cold and wind, and generally grows in a dense, stout,  pyramidal form. This tree usually reaches about SO feet  (ls m) in height.  Scotch pine seeds per pound range from 33,800 to  1l1,000, with a mean of 75,000 (74,500 to 245,000, with  a mean of 165,000 seeds per kilogram). Seeds per pound  for Austrian pine range from 14,000 to 39,000, with a  mean of 26,000 (30,900 to 86,000, with a mean of  57,300 seeds per kilogram) (Krugman and Jenkinson  1974).  The following is a synopsis of the methodology used  at the University of Idaho Forest Research Nursery to pro­duce  container-grown Scotch and Austrian pine seedlings  for research and conservation.  The Forest Research Nursery  Seedl ings are grown in two 34- by 108-foot (10- by  33-m) fiberglass greenhouses, and one 30- by 96-foot (9-  by 29-m) double-poly greenhouse, all connected by a  head house. Each greenhouse is heated by two natural  gas heaters, and vented with two 48-inch (l22-cm) ex­haust  fan and louver systems. Two 24-inch (61-&lt;:m) ven­ti  lating fans provide air and heat circulation through  poly-tubes placed beneath the growing benches in each  house. We feel poly-tubes placed in this manner, rather  than overhead, aid in air circulation and drying beneath  the benches and allow supplemental heat to rise through  the trays. Recent research also indicates this reduces  foliar disease incidence (Peterson and Sutherland 1990).  An evaporative cooling system and shutters along the  north side of the facility are used for cooling. Photoperiod  is extended by incandescent lamps at an intensity of  500 lu x.  The pH of the well water averages 6.8. Irrigation is  applied through an overhead travelling boom system wi th  nozzles every 8 inches (20 cm). We generally sow  numerous small lots of several species and the boom al­lows  us to give specific irrigation, fertilization and pesti­cide  attention to the individual lois. Fertilizers and  pesticides are applied through the irrigation  water using a 1:100 injector.  Seed Quality Tests  Each lot of seed is evaluated for quality upon re­ceipt.  The evaluation determines seeds per pound, purity  percentage, soundness, and germination.  Seeds per Pound  Seeds per pound are calculated by weighing five  repl ications of 100 seeds to the nearest 0.01 grams. The  mean weight is then placed into this equation:  45,360  Seeds per pound -  mean weight in grams of 100 seeds  Seeds per _ mean weight in grams of 100 seeds, 1000  kilogram  Purity Percentage  Purity is determined by removing the ""debris"" from a  15-gram (Scotch) or 50-gram (Austri an) 2500-seed sample.  Pine seed should be cleaned during processing and ex­hibit  at least 99-percent pure seed.  Pu n' ty % - - ___cl_ean_ s_eed_ w- e--ig''h'-t ___ • 100  clean seed weight + debris weight  Soundness Percentage  The percentage of hollow seeds is determined by  X-raying a 100- to 200-seed sample. This can also be  achieved by cutting the same number of seed. If more  than 5 percent of the seeds are hollow, the seed lot  should be reprocessed by pneumatic or gravity means to  eliminate the empty seeds.  Stratification and Germination Tests  The most important aspect of seed quality is how  well the seed will germinate. Seed germination is tested  using greenhouse rather than optimum laboratory tem­perature  conditions so that accurate amounts of seed can  be prepared for sowing.  The seed sample is placed into a fine mesh bag and  soaked 48 hours with running tap water to ensure imbi­bition.  The mesh bags are placed into plastic bags and a  sample of seed is stratified for 40 days at 33-36""1' (1-2 ""C).  At the end of the stratification period, seed is re­moved  and soaked 24 hours in running tap water. Four  100-seed replicates of each stratified lot are placed into  germination trays. Non-stratified seed for each lot (four  100-seed replication s) is also germinated. Seed is germi­nated  under 8 hours light at 75""1' (24""C) and 16 hours  dark at 65""1' (18 ""C). Cumulative cou nts are made at 7,  14, 21, and 28 days. At 28 days, any ungerminated seed  are cut to determine if they are hollow or sound.  Sowing Calculations  After determining which treatment gave the highest  cumulative germination at 21 days, the total amount of  seed needed for the crop can be determined. Using  probability tables (see Tinus and McDonald 1979), the  number of seed needed per cell to achieve about  95-percent cell occupancy is determined. We then  mathematically add 0.5 seed per cell to cover handling  and sowing losses. Each lot is oversown 10 percent at the  research nursery. With a given germination, the desired  number of seedlings, purity, sound seed percentage, and  seeds per pound, we calculate the pounds of seed need­ed  as follows:  (desired seedlings) • (aversow factor) • (seeds per cell)  (seeds per pound) • (purity percent) • (soundness percent)  2  Example:  For Austrian pine with 84-percent germination, we  find from the probability tables that 2 seeds per cell will  give us 97 percent of the cells filled. To make sure we  have enough seed to account for handling and sowing  loses, we add 0.5 seed per cell for an average of 2.5  seeds per cell.  Given: 26,000 seeds per pound (57,300 seeds per kilo­gram),  99-percent purity, 97-percent soundness,  15,000 trees desi red, and 10-percent oversow.

Experience at the nursery indicates that these spe­cies  may often perform best without stratification.  Growing Regime (Fig. 1)  Environmental Monitoring  The basic environmental factors are minimum and  maximum temperature, medium temperature, humidity,  and the pH and electrical conductivity of irrigation, ferti­gation  water, (irrigation water with injected liquid fertiliz­er  in solution), and leachate from the growing medium.  Maximum/minimum thermometers are placed  throughout each greenhouse to record the daily tempera­ture  range and a hygrothermograph charts the tempera­ture  and relative humidity patterns on a weekly basis.  Medium temperatures are obtained with a soil ther-mometer.  Irrigation and fertigation water are monitored to  keep the applied solution between pH 5.5 and 6.0.  Growing medium leachate is also monitored to detect in­creases  in medium pH. Leachate conductivity indicates  any serious increases in salt accumulation within the  medium that may become detrimental to the seedlings.  Tinus and McDonald (1979) discuss these topics and in­struments  in great detail, including calibration of  hygrothermographs.  Desired Seedling Characteristics  Outplanting data for pines indicate the need for  seedlings with large root collar diameters (caliper), well­formed  buds, high root growth potential, and a low ratio  between shoot and root dry weights. This regime  produces Scotch and Austrian pine seedlings averaging  15 cm in height with caliper between 2.8 and 3.2 mm,  well-formed buds, and high root growth potential.

Seedlings can also be produced in styrofoam  containers. In general, seedlings with larger root collar  diameters can be produced in containers with wider  spacing between cells. Before sowing, previously used  trays and cells are thoroughly washed and dipped into a  tank containing water at 160-165 °F (71-74°q for 15 se­conds  to effectively kill pathogenic fungi. After the trays  and cells have dried, the bottom 1 inch of the cells is  remoistened with tap water and the tray and cells run  through the filling machine. Moistening the bottom of  the cells causes dry growing medium to adhere and not  fall through the drainage holes. Cells are machine-filled  with a peat-vermiculite (1:1) growing medium. The pH of  this mix averages about 4.2. Seeds are sown with an op­tical  precision seeder and just barely covered with  washed white grit.  Germination Phase  Once sowing is complete, the containers are irrigat­ed  until the medium is thoroughly moist. Phosphoric  acid is injected into the irrigation water to adjust pH to  about 6.0. Light mists of acidified irrigation water are ap­plied  to keep the zone around the germinating seeds  slightly moist.  Some germinants may show symptoms of damping­off  fungi. Common fungi associated with damping-off in­clude  Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytopthora, and Fusarium.  Symptoms of damping-&lt;lff include a rotted stem at the  groundline, often with an apparently healthy top lying on  its side. The germinant, and preferably the entire cell,  should be removed from the greenhouse to prevent dis­ease  spread. Irrigation water can cause spores to splash  to other seedlings, thereby spreading the disease. Di sease  incidence declines as soon as the stems begin to lignify,  generally in three to four weeks (Tinus and McDonald  1979). At the research nursery we rely on these proper  cultural practices to reduce damping off: maintaining low  medium pH with acidified irrigation water, using grit to  allow air circu lation around the root collar zone, keeping  relative humidity low, and delaying nitrogen fertilization  until germination is complete.  Once sowing is complete, the crop is monitored  daily for problems. Damped-off seedlings are immediate­ly  rogued and tallied by species and seed lot. If damping­off  passes our damage threshold level (at least 15% of  the blocks within the seed lot have 3-5% of their cells  with disease), fungicide is applied to the problem seed­lot.  Thinning crews also rogue diseased seedlings and  help with monitoring. The process of roguing dead or  dying seedlings continues until the seedlings are extract­ed,  facilitated by rolling benches which allow convenient  access to all trays. We feel roguing is especially impor­tant  in removing potential hosts for Botrytis and for  4  minimizing Fusarium and other pathogen inoculum  build-up in our containers (Dumroese et al. 1990). If the  damage threshold is passed, we apply the fungicide  Banrot® (a soil drench) at 4 ounces per 100 gallons as  necessary.  Germination is generally complete within 21 days.  Cells are thinned to one seedling by removing the extra  germinants with tweezers or fingers as soon as the  majority of seedlings have shed their seedcoats. Seedlots  with high germination energy tend to shed their seed  coats rapidly. Vigorous seedlots may emerge from under  the grit in as little as three days. During seedcoat shed  (about week 2), seedlings enter the "" initial growth  phase:'  Initial Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to develop root systems  on the germinants, making them capable of incorporating  large amounts of nutrients and producing rapid shoot  growth during the accelerated growth phase. Large con­centrations  of phosphorous and potassium are applied to  achieve the desired growth.  Nutrients are applied during each twice weekly irri­gation  to meet targeted growth (Figs. 2 and 3). During  the initial growth phase, week 2 through week 6, we in­ject  a liquid fertilizer solution of Peters Conifer Starter'""  (7-40-17) at a rate of 42 ppm N supplemented with  micronutrients and phosphoric acid to adjust fertigation  water pH to below 6.0 (Table 1).  During this growth phase, day temperatures of  75-80Of (24-27'C) and night temperatures around 650f  (18'C) are maintained. Medium temperature (recorded at  8 am daily) averages 680f (20 'C). Photoperiod is extend­ed  to 18 hours. At the end of week 6 the medium is  leached with copious amounts of irrigation water to re­move  any salt build-up prior to beginning the accelerated  growth phase. Also during week 6, seedling foliage is  tested for nutrient concentrations to detect any deficien­cies.  Accelerated Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to achieve target seed­ling  height while increasing root collar diameter. This  phase begins during the seventh week. Levels of phos­phorous  and potassium are reduced and nitrogen con­centrations  increased to promote shoot growth.  Peters Conifer Grower'"" (20-7-19) is applied at 120  ppm N along with micronutrients and phosphoric acid.  Grower is alternated with calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at  46 ppm N and phosphoric acid (Table 2). Nutrients are  sti ll applied during the twice weekly irrigations. Pho­toperiod  and temperatures are the same as for the initial  growth phase.  Weather conditions, particularly the amount of sun­shine,  have a strong influence on initial growth of seedlings.

If  height growth is occurring faster than our target growth  curve, nitrogen rates are reduced by decreasing the rate  of calcium nitrate to 23 ppm N. Conversely, if growth is  lagging behind the target level, calcium nitrate levels can  be increased. The calcium nitrate rates are increased or  decreased depending on what the growth curves dictate.  During week 11, if height growth is at the desired  level, the medium is leached with copious amounts of ir­rigation  water to remove any salt build-up and excessive  fertilizer. The medium is then allowed to dry down until  it is just barely moist. If the seedlings are below target  height, calcium nitrate levels are increased and the leach  postponed until the target is met. Foliage is again tested  for nutrient deficiencies at this time to correct any  shortages.  Bud Initiation and  Root Collar Diameter Growth  The objective of this phase is to withhold moisture,  creating a stressed condition in the seedlings so that  height growth will cease, terminal buds will develop, and  root collar diameter will increase. During this growth  phase the seedlings are removed from the twice weekly  irrigationlfertilization schedule.  Seedlings are now irrigated only when medium has  become barely moist. Our greenhouse technicians daily  select seedlings at random, remove the rootplug from the  cell, and visually examine and feel the medium for dry­ness.  Although quite subjective, we feel this method has  some advantages. One advantage is that disease and in­sects  can be surveyed at the same time, and by random  selection, the seedlings that are seldom examined be­cause  of inaccessibility are also checked. By inspecting  the root plug, we also gain some insight as to how the  root system is developing.  Between week 12 and the appearance of buds,  seedlings receive calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at a rate of 46  ppm Nand micronutrients. Also, beginning with week 12  and then once every two weeks, seedlings receive Peter's  Foliar Feed® (27-15-12) at a rate of 972 ppm N until  needle run-off. Foliar fertilization continues until about  week 25. Once buds form, generally in about two or  three weeks, Peters Conifer Finisher0 (4-25-35) at a rate  of 24 ppm N, micronutrients, and phosphoric acid (Table  3) are applied together and alternated with calcium  nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at a rate of 92 ppm.  The extended photoperiod is discontinued. Day tem­peratures  are set for 60-70""1' (16-21 ""C) and night tempera­tures  for 50-60""1' (10-16 ""C). We maintain medium  temperatures between 62-68""1' (17-20""C) with these air  temperature ranges.  Table 3. Fertilizer target levels for bud initiation and root collar diameter grO'Nth.

(92 ppm N) altemated with micronutrients.  7  Cold Hardiness Induction Phase  The objective of this phase is to physiologically pre­pare  the trees for freezing temperatures. We accomplish  this by subjecting the trees to ambient temperatures, thus  allowing normal cold hardiness to develop.  Beginning around mid-October we allow air temper­atures  within the greenhouses to reach ambient levels  (Figure 1). However, the minimum temperature allowed  in the greenhouses is 28""1' (-2""C) and the root plug is  not allowed to remain frozen. Temperatures remain about  ambient until the seedlings are packed for cold storage  in January. From late October until the trees are put into  cold storage, irrigation is necessary only about once ev­ery  three to four weeks. During these irrigations, acceler­ated  growth phase fertilizer rates are applied. These act  as a nutrient reserve within the medium for use by the  tree when out-planted.  Extraction and Cold Storage  Seedlings are well watered before being removed  from their containers and placed in plastic bags in  groups of 20. Bundles of trees for public conservation  sales are placed five to a poly-bag (100 seedlings total)  which is sealed before going to refrigerated storage. Bun­dles  of trees for large reforestation working agreements  are placed into poly-lined wax boxes which are also  sealed air-tight before being placed in cold storage. The  refrigerated storage is kept at 33-34""1' (0.5-1 ""C). Seedlings  have been stored successfully in this manner for five  months without needing irrigation.  Seedlings in cold storage are routinely inspected for  disease problems. The most seriou~ disease is caused by  fungi of the genus Botrytis. Symptoms include webs of  gray to gray-brown myceli um growi ng through the tops of  the seed lings, especially in the center of bundles. Tan or  brown-watery stem lesions may also be present. Preventa­tive  methods are the best way to control this problem  and include the following: 1) pull, wrap, and store only  vigorous disease-free seedlings, 2) store seedlings for the  shortest duration possible, 3) routinely inspect a sample  of each lot, especially lots containing significant quanti­ties  of dead needles which can serve as an initial food  base for the pathogen, and 4) ship seedlings showing  mold problems immediately if possible (Sutherland and  Van Eerden 1980). Mold growth can also be reduced by  dropping the storage temperature for fully hardened  seedlings to 28-30""1'(-1 to -2 ""C) (Sutherland et al. 1989).  8  Conclusions  This regime has been very successful. Requested  quantities of seedlings meeting strict physiological and  morphological requirements are achieved or exceeded  with a minimum oversow. Seedlings grown under this re­gime  average 15 cm in height and 2.8 to 3.2 mm in cali­per.  We feel the most important aspect of any growing  regime is continually monitoring seedling growth as the  regime progresses. Height and caliper measurements can  then be used to modify or change the regime as the  growth of the seedlings dictates during one growing sea­son  and between growing seasons. This regime has been  developed from eight years of records on ferti lizer appli­cation  rates and the resultant seedling growth, and will  certainly be modified in the pursuit of high-quality pine  seedlings.

Pathogenicity of Fusarium Isolates from Douglas-fir Seed and Container-Grown Seedlings,"Twenty Fusarium isolates from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco) seed and seedlings were evaluated for their effects on Douglas-fir seed germination, post-emergence damping-off, and seedling root disease.  Inoculum consisting of perlite: cornmeal colonized with fungal isolates was mixed into peat: vermiculite growing medium then seed was sown or seedlings transplanted into the mixture.  A wide range of virulence occurred in populations of Fusarium isolated from Douglas-fir.  Several isolates were consistently the more virulent.  As a group, F.oxysporum isolates were more virulent that F. 'roseum' isolates, although some F. oxysporum isolates were quite virulent.  Test isolates of F. sambucinum were not virulent.  Both source of isolation (healthy versus diseased seed or seedlings) and species of Fusarium were unreliable predictors of potential virulence.","James, Robert L.; Dumroese, R.

Inoculum consisting of perlite:cornmeal  colonized with fungal isolates was mixed into peat:ver­miculite  growing medium then seed was sown or seed­lings  transplanted into the mixture. A wide range of viru­lence  occurred in populations of Fusar;um isolated from  Douglas-fir. Several isolates were consistently the more  vi rulent. As a group, F. oxysporum isolates were more  virulent than F. ""roseum"" isolates, although some F. oxy­sporum  isolates were non-pathogenic and some F. "" rose­um""  isolates were quite virulent. Test isolates of F.  sambuc;num were not virulent. Both source of isolation  (healthy versus diseased seed or seedlings) and species of  Fusar;um were unreliable predictors of potential  virulence.  Introduction  Production of conifer seed lings in containers has  steadily increased in the northern Rocky Mountains dur­ing  the past several years. New nurseries with container  facil ities have begun production, and established nurser­ies  have increased their output. With increased produc­tion,  diseases have become more troublesome, especially  those caused by Fusar;um spp. Because very little is  known about the behavior of Fusar;um on containeri zed  conifer seedlings, investigations were conducted to eluci­date  epidemiological characteri stics of this group of  pathogens. Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menzies;; var. glauca  [Beissn.] Franco) was studied since experience indicates  this species is often severely damaged by Fusar;um­associated  diseases Uames 1985, 1986, 1987).  We previously investigated inoculum sources, seed-  I ing infection, symptom production, and disease progres­sion  with in greenhouses Uames et al. 1987). During  those investigations, we obtained several hundred isolates  of Fusar;um. These isolates were systematically identified  and characterized by colony characteri6tics, spore mor­phology,  and growth rates and 'are described in another  report Uames et al. 1989).  One of the most difficult questions arising from our  epidemiological investigations concerned the potential of  different Fusar;um isolates to cause disease in seed lings.  Previous stud ies of conifer seedlings Uames and Gilligan  1988a, 1988b) show Fusar;um on seedling roots does not  necessarily lead to disease. In addition, the presence of  Fusar;um on the roots of diseased seedlings does not  necessarily mean Fusar;um caused the disease symptoms.  These uncertainties are best resolved by subjecting  representative isolates to Koch's postulates (pathogenicity  tests).  Briefly, Koch's postulates require that orga nisms iso­lated  from diseased plants be introduced onto healthy  plants, cause the same type of disease symptoms previ­ously  found, and be re-isolated from the inoculated  plants. In this way, we can conclude the isolated organ­ism(  s) indeed caused the disease symptoms. Such tech­niques  are laborious, especially if many isolates are  screened. However, th is is the only accepted way of  proving organisms are pathogens.  To determine the abi lity of Fusar;um isolates ob­tained  from Douglas-fir seed and seedlings to elicit dis­ease  symptoms, pathogenicity tests were conducted on  representative examples of several Fusar;um species.  Materials and Methods  Fusarium Isolates  Twenty Fusar;um isolates obtained from Douglas-fir  seed or seedlings at the USDA Forest Service Nursery,  Coeur d)\lene, Idaho, or the University of Idaho Forest  Research Nursery, Moscow, Idaho, were tested for  pathogenicity (table 1). Isolates were obtained from  diseased or healthy seed or from roots of diseased  (including damped-off) or non-diseased seed lings. They  were maintained on PDA slants at about 15°C for severa l  months prior to the tests.  Ten isolates were classified as F. oxysporum Schlecht.  based on colony morphology, growth rate, pigmentation,  and types of sporulation (Nelson et al. 1983). The other  10 isolates were placed in the"" roseum"" group because  they produced carmine red pigment on potato dextrose  agar (PDA). Seven of the "" roseum"" isolates were identi­fied  as F. acum;natum Ell. & Ev. because of their needle­thin  macroconidia, lack of microconidia, and abundant  production of chlam~ospores (Nelson et 01. 1983). One  isolate was classified as F. avenaceum (Fr.) SacCo because,  even though it had spores resembling those of F.  acuminatum, it failed to produce chlam~ospores in  culture after a long incubation. The other two isolates  were identified as F. sambucinum Fuckel based on their  macroconidial morphology, chlam~ospore produdion,  and cu ltural charaderistics.  Inoculum Preparation  Inoculum for all pathogenicity tests was prepared us­ing  the techniques of Miles and Wilcoxson (1984). This  inoculum type was effective in previous pathogenicity  tests on conifer seedlings Uames and Gilligan 1984). In­oculum  was produced in galvanized metal pans (5 cm x  25 cm x 35 cm) lined with a double layer of aluminum  foil. Perlite, an inert, inorganic, siliceous rock of volcanic  origin commonly used in potting mixtures, was the ma­trix  for fungal growth. In each metal pan, 150 g of yel­low  cornmeal was moistened with 300 ml warm 1 %  PDA and left standing for 15 minutes before 75 g of per­lite  was thoroughly mixed in. The pans were covered  with aluminum foi I and autoclaved for 60 minutes at  121°C. After cooling. the perlite-cornmeal cake was in­oculated  with 1 cm' pieces of mycelium from 14-day-old  Fusarium cultures grown on PDA. Pieces from two cul­ture  plates were mixed with the perlite-cornmeal cake  with a steri le knife, 50 ml of sterile distilled water was  added, and the pan was sealed. Sealed pans were in­cubated  in the dark at about 24°C for 24 days. FollOWing  incubation, fungal cake mixtures were air dried on a  tabletop for 3 days and stored in plastic bags at 80C until  needed.  Prior to each pathogenicity test, inoculum was tested  for viability by placing pieces on plates of PDA and in­cubating  under cool fluorescent light at about 220C for  5-7 days. All prepared inoculum remained viable and un­contaminated  for several months and was in this condi­tion  prior to use in pathogenicity tests.  Metal trays (38 cm x 23 cm x 5 cm) were filled with  a standard, pre-mixed 1:1 peat:vermiculite growing medi­um  (W. R. Grace & Co., Portland, Oregon) used to grow  containerized seedlings. Trays with soil mix were au­toclaved  (121°C for 60 min.) and allowed to cool. Perl ite-  Table 1.

The inoculum-growing medium mix­ture  was then moistened with sterile distilled water.  Damping-off Test  Seed for this test came from lot FN of the University  of Idaho Forest Research Nursery. Seed were colleded in  1981 near Bovill, Idaho, (1,000 m elevation) and had  been in refrigerated storage at 2°C prior to sowing.  Seed were treated using the nursery's standard bleach  (sodium hypochlorite) treatment (Wenny and Dumroese  1987) then immersed 3 minutes in a 70% v/v solution of  ethanol. Next, treated seed were placed in a running wa­ter  rinse for 48 hours. After 28 days of cold stratification  at 2°C, 200 seed were sown in each tray containing an  inoculum-growing medium mixture and covered with a  O.5-cm layer of grit. Trays were watered when needed but  not fertilized. Controls consisted of autoclaved growing  medium amended with uninoculated perlite at the same  two treatment concentrations. Therefore, the experimental  design was for 20 isolates, each tested at two inoculum  concentrations, and two controls tested at two non­inoculated  perlite concentrations for a total 44 trays. All  experiments were conducted inside a greenhouse with  standard seedling growing regimes.  Germination and emergence of seedlings was moni­tored  in each tray. Post-emergence damping-off was de­termined  by examining trays for fallen seedlings and  seedlings with stem lesions. Damped-off seedlings were  carefully removed and replaced by toothpicks (plate 1).  The seedlings were washed carefully and placed on a  selective medium for Fusarium isolation (Komada 1975).  Plates were incubated under cool fluorescent light at  about 22°C for 7-10 days. Emerging fusaria were com­pared  with inoculated isolates to confirm they were the  same. The experiment was terminated when germination  was considered complete (27 days after sowing).  Upon completion of the experiment, 10 non-diseased  seedlings were collected from each tray for root isola­tions.  In some cases, 10 non-diseased seedlings were not  avai lable, either because the tested isolate had killed al l  emerged seedlings or because less than 10 non.&lt;:Jiseased  seedlings had emerged. Roots of non-diseased seedlings  were washed thoroughly to remove adhering soil parti­cles,  surface sterilized in 0.525 % sodium hypochlorite,  rinsed with sterile distilled water, plated on Komada's  medium, and incubated as described previously. Emerg­ing  fusaria were compared with inoculated isolates to de­termine  if the isolates had invaded the non.&lt;:Jiseased  seedlings. Also, 10 ungerminated seed were carefully re­moved  from each tray and plated directly onto Komada's  medium to determine if seed decay or pre-emergence  damping-off had occurred. Emerging fusaria were again  compared with inoculated isolates.  After seedlings and seed were removed from the  trays, the inoculum-growing medium mixture was passed  3  Plate 1.

The resulting fine growing medium was  mixed with sterile disti lled water, and 1 ml of the solu­tion  was placed on Komada's medium. Emerging fusaria  were compared with the inoculated isolates to determine  if these organisms had colonized the fine growing medi­um  particles.  Young Seedling Test  All isolates were tested for their ability to elicit root  disease symptoms on young seedlings. Seedlings from lot  FN had been grown in Spencer-LaMeire Root Trainers®  for 7 weeks prior to inoculation. Inoculum was prepared  and mixed with growing medium (1:50 wlw) as previous­ly  described. Seedlings were carefully removed from their  containers to minimize root damage. Seedling roots were  washed thoroughly to remove adhering particles of grow­ing  medium, and the seedlings were repotted into Ray  Leach® pine cells (66 cm') with the inoculum-growing  medium mixture. Twenty-five seedlings were repotted per  isolate. Controls consisted of repotted seedlings in an  uninoculated perlite-soil mixture. Seedlings were watered  with fine-mist, overhead irrigation as needed.  Severity of root disease symptoms was rated using a  5-point system describing extent of foliar chlorosis and  necrosis (table 2). When seedlings were considered  dead, they were carefully removed from containers. Their  roots were thoroughly washed to remove growing medi-  Table 2.

As many root tips as possible were included in  each sample. Root pieces were placed on Komada's  medium and incubated as previously described. Emerg­ing  fusaria were compared with inoculated isolates to  confirm they were the same.  The experiment was terminated 84 days after inocu­lation.  At that time, all remaining seedlings were rated  for severity of disease symptoms, removed from their  contai ners, and their roots analyzed for presence of  Fusarium as described above. Comparisons were made  between emerging fusaria and inoculated isolates to con­firm  infection by tested isolates.  Older Seedling Test  A final test was conducted to evaluale isolate  pathogenicity on 5-month-old seedlings. Inoculum was  prepared and mixed with growing medium (1 :50 w/w)  as described previously. Test seedlings were carefully re­moved  from their pine cell containers and their roots  thoroughly washed to remove as much growing medium  as possible. They were repotted into Ray Leach'"" super  cells (144 cm') with the inoculum-growing medium mix­ture.  Ten seedlings per isolate were repotted. Controls  consisted of repotted seedlings in uninoculated perlite­soil  mixture.  Seedlings were watered and monitored for foliar in­dications  of root disease as described in the young seed­ling  test (table 2). This experiment was terminated after  68 days; this was the end of the growing season and  most seedlings were dormant. During this test, only one  seedl ing died. Its roots were washed, dissected, and in­cubated  on Komada's medium as described for the  young' seedling test. All other seedlings were rated for  extent of disease symptoms and carefully removed from  their containers. From each, 10 lateral roots were ran­domly  selected and 2-3-mm-long tips were aseptically se­vered  and incubated on Komada's medium as previously  described. Emerging fusaria were compared with inocu­lated  isolates to confirm root infection by test isolates.  4  Data Analysis  Comparisons of germination and post-emergence  damping-off between the two inoculum concentrations  were made using a paired ""t"" test. Statistical tests were  conducted separately for each group of isolates.  Results  Damping-off Test  The two inoculum concentrations of F. oxysporum  isolates were significantly (P - 0.05) different in their ef­feets  on percent seed germination but not on post­emergence  damping off (table 3). The higher concentra­tion  (1 :25) resulted in less seed germination . For the F.  "" roseum"" isolates (table 4), no significant differences in  either germination or post-emergence damping-off were  noted when comparing inoculum concentrations.  There were large differences in the ability of various  isolates to cause disease of seed and recently emerged  seedlings (tables 3 and 4). All isolates successfully  colonized the roots of surviving non-diseased seedlings  (table 5); most also colon ized seed and were probably  important in limiting seed germination.  A few "" control"" seed lings became diseased (tables 3  and 4). Isolations from diseased control seed lings indicat­ed  that many were colonized with F. oxysporum by the  end of the experiment.  Isolations from fine, growing medium particles at the  conclusion of this experiment commonly yielded inocu­lated  isolates. Apparently the inoculated fusaria com­pletely  colonized all organic matter within the growing  medium.  Table 3. Effects of Fusarium oxysporum isolates on germination Table 4.

Disease severity ratings (extent of root  disease symptoms) were highest for seedlings inoculated  with the same F. oxysporum isolates (29G and 56M) that  were most virulent on young seedl ings (table 7 and plate  3). This was not always the case for the F. ""roseum""  isolates.  Several older seedlings inoculated with F. oxysporum  had roots colonized with fusaria other than the  inoculated isolates (table 7, column b). Most of these  other fusaria were isolates of F. oxysporum; they may  have colonized seed ling roots prior to inoculation with  7  Plate 3. Older seedlings 68 days after inoculation.

These other fusaria were recovered from  seedling roots more frequently and inoculated isolates  found less frequently in the F. oxysporum group than in  the F. ""roseum"" group.  Combination of All Tests  Numerical rankings were used to compare isolate  virulence in each of four tests: seed germination, post­emergence  damping-off, young seedling disease, and old­er  seedling disease (table 8). Rankings were assigned on  the basis of ability to cause disease. The more vi rul ent  isolates had lower numerical rankings, i.e., the most viru­lent  isolate was ranked first. Rankings were equally  weighted for each test to calcu late a composite ranking  for all tests. Comparisons were made within each group  of isolates (F. oxysporum and F. ""roseum') and for all  isolates combined.  With few exceptions, isolate virulence was consis­tent  across the four tests.

Discussion  Our results confirm previous studies (Bloomberg  1981, james and Gilligan 1984, james et al. 1986, Tint  1945) showing Fusarium isolates obtained from conifer  seed and seed ling roots often display a wide range of  pathogenicity. Some isolates readily cause disease in in­fected  plants; others do not (Bloomberg 1971). Bloomberg  and Lock (1972) concluded from their work in bareroot  nurseries that the several different diseases caused by F.  oxysporum are probably caused by different strains of the  fungus.  However, even though they may not cause disease  symptoms, most isolates readily colonize cortical cells of  seedling roots (B loomberg 1966, james and Gilligan  1988b). These organisms may remain ""dormant"" in-defi  nitely or may become active pathogens when the  8  host is stressed (Bloomberg 1971, 1973). In any event, it is  not unusual to .obtain several different Fusarium isolates  from the roots of non-diseased seedlings (Bloomberg  1966, 1971; james and Gilligan 1988a, 1988b; james et  al. 1987).  Results of our pathogenicity tests indicate some of  the most virulent isolates came from roots of non­diseased  seedlings or from apparently healthy seed (F.  oxysporum isolates 29G and 56M and F. ""roseum"" iso­lates  5E and 46E). Conversely, some of the least  pathogenic isolates came from roots of diseased seed­lings.  Therefore, the relative virulence or aggressiveness  of isolates cannot be accurately predided from their iso­lation  source. Experience has also shown cultural charac­teristics  are unreliable indicators of the virulence of  isolates from conifer seedlings Uames and Gilligan 1984,  james et al. 1986).  Recent work indicates pathogenic Fusarium isolates  may be located using heterokaryosis analysis of auxo­trophic  mutants (Puhalla 1985) and isozyme pattern anal­ysis  (Reddy and Stahman 19·72). These procedures stress  the importance of genetic control of pathogenicity and  have proven fairly accurate in identifying pathogenic  strains of Fusarium from agricultural crops. However,  such work on conifer seedling isolates has not been  reported.  The most virulent F. "" roseum"" isolates were classi­fied  as either F. acuminatum or F. avenaceum. Adual  differences between these two species are minimal and  based only on produdion of chlamydospores in culture  (Nelson et al. 1983). They may be the same species.  Isolates classified as F. sambucinum (30F and 69B)  were morphologically distinct from the other F. "" rose­um""  isolates (Nelson et al. 1983). Both F. sambucinum  isolates were less pathogenic than isolates of other spe­cies  in our tests. Even though this species has been iso­lated  frequently from conifer seed lings (Hansen and  Hamm 1988, James et al. 1988), it may not be as impor­tant  a pathogen as other Fusarium species (Hansen and  Hamm 1988, James and Gilligan 1984, Tint 1945).  Our investigations point out the complexi ty of the  Fusarium disease situation in containerized Douglas-fir  seed lings. The different species of Fusarium may elicit  symptoms at different stages of the crop cycle. Some iso­lates  are capable of causing rapid disease, whereas  others are mainly saprophytic. There is also an uncl ear  relationship between species and source of isolate and  relative virulence. Some Fusarium isolates may even be  beneficial if they protect seed ling roots from infedion by  pathogens (Baker and Cook 1974).  More work is needed to clarify the role of environ­mental  conditions (moisture, temperature, etc.) on  pathogeni city of Fusarium in Douglas-fir and other  conifer species. We also need to understand the role of  inherent genetic susceptibility. For example, it is possible  that seedlots with poor germination capacity or low ger­mination  energy are more prone to Fusarium damage.  Also, under the right conditions of envi ronmentally in­duced  stress and host susceptibility, it is possible most  Fusarium strains wi ll cause disease in conifer seedlings.  It is important to identify the important fadors contribut­ing  to disease expression in conifer seedlings so more ef­fedive  control measures can be developed.

Saveland Stephen R. Bakken  Leon F. Neuenschwander  Introduction  Fire is an important element of the environment for  ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). It plays a number of  roles in the ponderosa community (Siswell et al. 1973)  and provides the land manager with an opportunity to  use prescribed fire to meet a variety of management ob­jectives.  Prescribed fire in ponderosa pine has been used  mainly to reduce wildfire hazar~ (Weaver 1957, Knorr  1963, Kallander 1969, Iruesdeli 1969, Sackett 1980, Har­rington  1981). It has also been used to improve range  conditions under ponderosa pine (Cooper 1960, S,swell  1972, Hall 1976, Severson and Boldt 1977, Harris and  Covington 1983, Oswald and Covington 1983, Gartner  and White 1986). In addition, fire can be used to thin  ponderosa pine (Weaver 1947, 1959, 1967, Morris and  Mowat 1958, Lynch 1959, Pearson et al. 1972), prepare a  seedbed for natural regeneration (Schubert 1974, Barrett  1979, Sackett 1984, Haase 1986), and restrict pine en­croachment  into grasslands (Gartner and I hompson  1973). When planning a prescribed fire, the land manag­er  needs a reliable prediction of ponderosa pine mortali­ty.  This study provides the tools to predict mortality of  ponderosa pine resulting from fall prescribed fires in  northern Idaho. A mortality model based on scorch  height was developed, and since the model requires  scorch height as input, Van Wagner's (1973) scorch height  predictive equations were tested.  Fire and Ponderosa Pine  Ponderosa pine has evolved with an average natural  fire frequency of 6 to 19 years with a range of 2 to 48  years (Wright 1978, Wright and Bailey 1982). This tree  species has very pronounced survival mechanisms within  a highly flammable community (Mutch 1970). The fire­tolerant  characteristics of ponderosa pine include thick  exfoliating bark, high open crown, high foliar moisture  content (28-36% free water), large buds, relatively deep  roots, and the ability to self-prune. Flammable properties  of the ponderosa pine community include annual  production of fine fuel and abundant needle drop. Since  they dry out quickly, the fallen needles are highly flam-mable,  make up a porous fuel bed, and have a high ratio  of surface area to volume.  The fire resistance of ponderosa pine is due mainly  to a thick exfoliating bark that is accumulated at an early  age. Hall (1976) reports a 0.3 to 0.6 cm thick dead layer  at 5.1 cm diameter at breast height (dbh). Ponderosa pine  has a thick outer bark of low density exfoliating material  with a relatively low moisture content that does not read­ily  conduct heat. In addition, the bark surrounds a very  moist core of high density wood which is thermally con­ductive.  The outer bark insulates the cambium from ex­ternal  heat, while the cambium tends to dissipate the  heat energy it receives. Martin (1963) argues that these  factors favor survival of cambium in large diameter trees  because the bark is thicker and the internal moist wood  volume much greater than in small diameter trees.  Dieterich (1979) concluded that recovery of south­western  ponderosa pine is dependent on the season  when the fire occurs, the percentage of crown scorch,  consumption of live crown, site conditions, available  moisture the following growing season, and incidence of  insect attacks. If a large portion of the crown was re­moved  by scorching, growth usually decreased the first  year following the fire, but returned to normal during the  second and third growing seasons.  Prescribed understory burning has produced different  results according to the season of year (Harrington 1987).  Harrington (1987) found that ponderosa pine mortality  was highest in summer, followed closely by spring. Mor­tality  was lowest in the fall. Spring burning occurs during  the most active growing period for all plants; thus, a  plant's ability to recover from damage decreases because  carbohydrate reserves are lowest at this time (Norum  1975). Additionally, crown damage is most severe in  spring and early summer burning because of low foliar  moisture content and the succulent nature of the buds  and twigs (Wagener 1961, Norum 1975). Bark beetles are  able to concentrate on damaged trees following early  season burns. Following dormant season burns, insects  cannot respond to the stressed conditions of the  damaged trees until the following spring, an interval  which allows surviving trees additional recovery time  (Miller and Keen 1960, Fischer 1980, Mitchell and Martin  1980). Thus, when the objective of a prescribed fire is to  minimize ponderosa pine mortality, fall burning is pre­ferred  over spring or summer burning, although spring  and summer burning may be necessary to meet other  objectives.  Mortality  Damage by prescribed burning to overstory trees is  caused by accumulated heat sufficient to consume or  desiccate the living tissue. Location of the heat source,  duration, and intensity of fire in relation to living tissue  are primary features affecting plants. A tree can be divid­ed  into three areas to assess tissue damage resulting from  the heat of a fire: the crown, the bole, and the roots  (Ryan 1982). The leaves of trees are most susceptible to  heat damage; however, these tissues are located quite far  from the heat source. Cambium existing at the base of  the tree stem is insulated from the heat, but is very close  to the heat source. Foliage and cambium are primary  areas where tissue damage occurs during fires (Martin  and Brackebusch 1974, Van Wagner 1973). Where much  litter has built up around large ponderosa pines, bole  and root damage is a significant factor in determining  mortality (Sackett, in press).  Crown damage is a good predictor of ponderosa  pine mortality following fire (Herman 1950, 1954,  Wagener 1961, Dieterich 1979). Wagener (1961) reports  that bud kill was important in determining the survival  chances of ponderosa pine, and concludes also that sea­son  of year, tree age, and site are important in determin­ing  mortality. Herman (1950, 1954) found scorch height  and mortality of poles and mature timber were closely  correlated.  Dead cambium is a significant factor when found in  all four quadrants of the stem cross section in conjunc­tion  with 50% or more of live crown scorched (Mann  and Gunter 1960), yet a tree must be completely girdled  to die by cambial damage alone. Fahnestock and Hare  (1964) observed that cambium injury occurred in streaks  and spots and covered appreciable areas only on the lee­ward  side of some trees burned in headfires. Any fire  that is intense enough to girdle a large ponderosa pine  will probably scorch all its foliage as well. However, it  may be possible to have low intensity fires that produce  low scorch heights and completely girdle the tree if the  fire burns for a long duration at the base. Since crown  damage adequately predicts mortality for ponderosa pine,  and cambial and root damage are difficult and expensive  to detect, the initial purpose of this study was to provide  a reliable mortal ity model based on crown damage.  Crown damage has been assessed a number of differ­ent  ways, including measurement of percentage of the  crown volume scorched (usually referred to as percent  crown scorch), percentage of buds and twigs consumed,  percentage of crown length scorched, and the maximum  height above ground of scorched foliage (usually referred  to as scorch height). Percent crown scorch predicts tree  mortality better than scorch height (Peterson 1985, Peter­son  and Arbaugh 1986, Ryan et al. 1988). However, per­cent  crown scorch is of little value for predicting tree  mortality to plan prescribed fires. Peterson (1985) found  that calculated crown scorch volume based on scorch  height and tree dimensions was significantly greater than  observed crown scorch volume. On the other hand,  scorch height can be related to predicted fire intensity.  Thus, mortality models based on scorch height are useful  for planning prescribed fires, whereas models based on  percent crown scorch would be more appropriate for  conducting salvage operations after a wildfire. Since the  purpose of this study was to develop a mortality model  for use in planning prescribed fires, the model is based on  scorch height rather than percent crown scorch. Including  dbh in the model allows for direct comparison with  Bevins' (1980) mortality model for interior Douglas-fir  2  (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca).  Bevins (1980) utilized a logistic regression model to  estimate survival of fi~injured Douglas-fir using data  from Norum's (1975) study as input to the logistic regres­sion  routine, and RISK (Hamilton 1974) to obtain tree sur­vival  predictions within the probability interval (0,1). Stem  dbh and crown scorch height predicted survival better  than any other combination of variables.  Scorch Height  The height at which lethal foliage temperature is  reached or exceeded above a flaming front is dependent  upon fireline intensity, ambient air temperature, and  wind speed (Van Wagner 1973). The basic theoretical  models for prediction of scorch height are given by Tay­lor  (1961) and Thomas (1964). Van Wagner (1973) adapted  the equations for low wind conditions.  Equation 1 H, - K,(I)'""  Equation 2  (I) '""  H, - K, (60 _ n  Equation 3 H - K,----------~~------  , [.107(1) + W,] If' (60 - T)  where,  H, - scorch height (m)  Ki - constant generated from regression analysis  I - fireline intensity (Kcal/sec-m)  T - ambient air temperature (OC)  W - windspeed (m/sec).  Equation 1 relates scorch height to the ¥, power of  fireline intensity (I). Fireline intensity equals rate of  spread multiplied by fuel weight consumed per unit area  multiplied by heat of combustion (Byram 1973). Equation  2 involves fireline intensity and ambient air temperature  (D in degrees Celsius. The third equation introduces the  wind (W) in meters per second. The regression coeffi­cients  (Ki) are determined empirically. When investigating  different temperatures at different heights, Van Wagner  (1975) reports an average value of K, equal to 8.9, with a  range of values from 5.2 to 14.2.

Four locations were selected in mature, seral  ponderosa pine stands of the Douglas-fir/ninebark  (Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus malvaceous) habitat  type (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968). Two of the re­search  areas located near Tensed, Idaho, supported a  mixed stand of ponderosa pine with occasional Douglas­fir.  These areas were selectively harvested during the  summer of 1978, just prior to burning. The remaining  •  sites, one near Plummer, Idaho, and the other near  Worley, Idaho, consisted of pure ponderosa pine stands  surrounded by agricultural land. Both of these sites were  selectively harvested prior to 1975.  The understory vegetation was locally dominated by  a mixture of shrubs characteristic of the ninebark union  (Daubenmire and Daubenmire 1968); however, the low  rhizomatous shrubs of snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus)  and wild rose (Rosa spp.) had a greater cover. Native and  introduced grasses were abundant. A diverse mixture of  forbs was conspicuously present, but their cover was low.  The soils of the Tensed units were classified as loamy  skeletal, mixed, frigid Dystric Xeroochrept of the  Minaloosa series. The Plummer and Worley sites were a  fine-silty, mixed, mesic argiaquic Xeric Argialboll of the  Southwick series (U.s. Soil Conservation Service, St.  Maries, Idaho). All locations were relatively flat with  slope gradients ranging from 0 to 30%. Elevations above  mean sea level ranged from 790 to 880 m.  Mean annual precipitation was 56 to 66 cm. Air  temperature averaged 6.9°C at the nearest weather sta­tion,  Tensed, Idaho (U.s. Dept. of Commerce 1976-1978).  Annual precipitation measured at this station for 1978  was 69.6 cm. Although long-term averages were not kept  at Tensed, the annual precipitation for the entire north  Idaho area was 14% below normal in 1978. The study  areas had below average precipitation for 1976 and 1977  (16% and 20% below normal, respectively), thus the  trees may have been under drought stress at the ti me of  the burn.  Methods  Four locations were divided into 16 (0.2 - 1.0 hal  burn plots each, for a total of 64 plots. To determine the  effects of understory burning, plots were assigned one of  four treatments: 1) control (no burn), 2) backfire, 3) single  headfire, and 4) strip headfire, and were burned with  different fuel loads, fuel moistures and weather condi­tions  (Bakken 1981). The strip headfires had 2 to 6 m  spacing, which prevented fire intensity from reaching its  potential maximum. The total of 64 treatments were dis­tributed  as follows: 16 controls, 15 backfires, 17 single  headfires, and 16 strip headfires. All burning was con­ducted  between the hours of 1:00 and 6:00 p.m. during  September and October 1978.  In order to verify Van Wagner's work, mean scorch  height was determined from three or more trees with a  clear demarkation of scorch. Fireline intensity was calcu­lated  as the product of rate of spread, fuel weight con­sumed  per unit area, and heat of combustion (4500  cal/gram). Units of measure were Kcal/sec-m- ° C. With  these restrictions, only 5 of the 15 backfires, 9 of the 17  headfires, and 8 of the 16 strip headfires were available  for the regression analysis. One additional strip headfire  was deleted because it fell outside Van Wagner's range of  intensities. Most backfires were eliminated because they  did not result in detectable scorch over 1 m. Table 1  gives a summary of scorch height from the 21 fall fires.  Data were collected during three time periods:  preburn (site description and fuel loading variables),  Table 1.

During each burn, temperature, flame  length, rate of spread, relative humidity, and windspeed  were recorded three times.  Fuel loading was determined by two methods, de­pendent  upon the type and size class of fuel. Fuel loads  were measured preburn and postburn to determine fuel  reduction. Large down woody fuels were sampled using  Brown's (1974) planar intersect method. These included  100-hour fuels (2.5 em to 7.6 em dia.) and 1000-hour  fuels (7.6 em dia.). Litter, duff, herbaceous grasses and  forbs, l-hour fuels (0 to 0.6 em dia.), la-hour fuels (0.6 to  2.5 em dia.), and shrubs were sampled by direct  weight collections using 0.1 m' quadrats (5 quadrats per  plot). Fuel loadings on the four locations ranged from  35,090 Kg/ha at Tensed to 58,200 Kg/ha at Plummer.  The partially decomposed duff was the dominant fuel  component on all sites, constituting between 50 and  59% of total fuel loading (Bakken 1981).  Fuel moisture at the time of the burn was taken  directly for litter, duff, herbaceous grasses and forbs,  l-hour, and la-hour woody fuels. The moisture content of  the shrubs was not taken. The forest floor quadrat sam­ples  were weighed, oven-dried at 70·C for 24 hours,  then reweighed and converted to fuel moisture. Table 2  summarizes the burning conditions.  Mensurational and tree damage data were acquired  together in the spring of 1979 after budbreak. One  hundred-ninety-four ponderosa pine trees were sampled.  Stem dbh was rounded to the nearest 5 em increment.  Total tree height and average crown scorch height were  measured to the nearest whole meter with a clinometer  and 100-m measuring tape. Seedlings less than 0.5 m tall  were not measured. Mortality was determined by assess­ing  the presence or absence of new growth the following  spring.  Statistical Analysis  A logistic model is often used to predict individual  tree mortality (Hamilton and Edwards 1976, Hamilton  1986). The RISK logistic regression routine (Hamilton  1974) predicted tree survival in the interval 0 (dead) to 1  (alive). Regression coefficients were tested for sig­nificance  using Student's t test. The regression routine  fits the data to a logistic function of the form:  Pis) - 11 + el• + b,l]""  where,  Pis) - estimated probability of survival in the  interval (0,1)  e - base of the natural logarithms  a - regression constant  b - vector of regression coefficients  x - vector of independent variables.

To test the scorch height predictive equations, data  were fined using least squares regression to Van Wagn­er's  (1973) equations and arranged to pass through the  origin. The dependent variable was scorch height. In­dependent  variables were Van Wagner's (1973) Equa­tions  1, 2, and 3. Student's t test was used as the test  statistic to determine if each coefficient was significantly  different from zero. Results of all statistical tests were  considered significant if P &lt; 0.05.  Results And Discussion  Mortality  Of a total of 194 ponderosa pine examined for this  study, 81 (42%) were determined to be dead in the  spring following the fall fires. As expected, surviving  trees tended to be taller, have greater stem diameters,  and lower percentage of live crown scorched (Table 3).  When compared to data for Douglas-fir (Bevins 1980), a  higher percent crown scorch was required to kill smaller  ponderosa pine trees.  The resulting mortality equation for ponderosa pine is:  Equation 4 P(s) - [1 + e(1.33-37DBH • 36H,j -1  where,  DBH - diameter at breast height (cm)  Hs - scorch height (m).  The combined use of stem dbh and crown scorch height  as independent variables in the logistic regression routine  allows direct comparison with Bevins' (1980) results for  interior Douglas-fir. Since Bevins' (1980) results are in  English units and the conveJ5ion is difficult, the equation  for ponderosa pine in English units is:  Equation 5 P(s) - [1 + e(1.33-.9SDBH •. lIH,j -1  where,  DBH - diameter at breast height (in.)  Hs - scorch height (ft.).  Equation 4 suggests that ponderosa pine is very resistant  to mortality from scorch (Figure 1). The steep slope of  the scorch height curves shows that probability of sur­vival  decreases with increasing scorch height for small  diameter trees. Once a tree exceeds 45 cm in diameter,  it has a high probability of survival for the range of  intensities within this study.

Scorch Height  In order to predict mortality before the burn, scorch  height must be predicted. Van Wagner's (1973) third  equation is usually used to predict scorch height. Table 4  compares the regression coefficients (Ki) in Equations 1,  2, and 3 found by Van Wagner (1973, 1975) and the  coefficients generated from this study.

Van Wagner (1973) stated that the third equation rests on  a weak theoretical basis compared to the still ai r case.  His main conclusion was that scorch height varies with  the ¥l power of fireline intensity (Equation 1). Also, the  range of wind values in this study and Van Wagner's  (1973) study is very limited. All things considered, the  third equation involving wind should not be used to pre­dict  scorch height.  The regression coefficients for ponderosa pine in  Equations 1, 2, and 3 are consistently lower than reported  for other species (Van Wagner 1973). Van Wagner (1975)  reported a wide range of values for K,(5.2 to 14.2). Thus,  scorch height varies by tree species. This vari ation can be  dealt with by developing different regression coefficients  for different species instead of relying on an average.  20  E  ~ 15  I  l­I  (!)

Ponderosa pine with a gentle slope (K, -  6.9) is resistant to scorch. Van Wagner (1975) recom­mends  using the average value of K, - 10.0 from his  1973 and 1975 studies. Using this value will overestimate  scorch height for ponderosa pine, except at very low in­tensity  and temperature combinations. The reduced value  of K, is due possibly to foliar moisture content which af­fects  the specific heat of needles. Ponderosa pine has a  high foliar moisture content (about 106% for the lower  branches), with about 28 to 36% free water, a water con­tent  much higher than for other northern Rocky Moun­tain  conifers Uackson 1978).

Thus, the high initial heat pulse accounts for only two­thirds  of the variation in scorch heights encountered.  Several factors may help explain the variation. Van Wag­ner  (1973) reports the difficulties created by wind speed  because of its opposing effects on several aspects of fire  behavior. As wi nd speed increases, the convection  column is deflected. Cooler air enters into the plume,  and the effective distance to the crown canopy is in­creased.  This tends to reduce the temperature at any ver­tical  height above the ground. Ventilation is the ability of  cool air to enter the stand and replace the heated air.  Topography, unit layout, and stand density all affect wind  flow through the canopy. Scorch height can be expected  to increase when wind flow through the canopy is re­stricted.  Wind speed also increases intensity by increas­ing  the combustion rate, thereby increasing the  temperature in the convective plume.  The accumulated heat necessary to kill plant tissue is  a time-temperature relationship: a high temperature ex­posure  for a short period of time, or a lower temperature  exposure for a long time period can have the same re­sult.  Kayll (1968) and Hare (1961) report that conifer foli­age  is killed by a l-minute exposure to 60· C or a  10-minute exposure to 50· C. The intensity measured in  this and similar studies (Van Wagner 1973, 1975) is gross  intensity, which accounts for the high initial convective  heat pulse but makes no allowance for radiant heat and  delayed combustion. If the moisture content of duff and  large fuels is low enough and there is a substantial  amount of duff or large fuels, they may provide radiant  heat for extended periods of time, thereby increasing  scorch height.  Conclusions  Mortality from fire is a function of percent crown  scorch, cambial damage, consumption of twigs and buds,  season of fire, site condition, tree age, tree vigor, availa­ble  growing season moisture, and incidence of subse­quent  insect and disease attacks. In order to better  prepare for fall understory burning in ponderosa pine, a  mortality model based on scorch height and diameter at  breast height was developed to predict postfire survival.  Scorch height and diameter at breast height are easily  measured and adequately predict survival. The model  demonstrates that fire will thin from below, killing the  smaller trees. When compared to the mortality model for  Douglas-fir (Bevins 1980), smaller ponderosa pine have a  higher probability of survival than larger Douglas-fir. This  is because ponderosa pine possesses certain fire survival  mechanisms, primarily a thick exfoliating bark and high  open crown with moist, long needles.  For the mortality model to be useful for predicting  the results of understory burning before ignition, an ac­curate  means of predicting scorch height is required.  When examining the variance, minimum height, and  maximum height of scorch (Table 1), one finds that  scorch height can be highly variable within a stand. AI-  7  though the predictive equations developed in this and  other studies may be helpful, there is no substitute for  understory burning experience (Kilgore and Curtis 1987).  Ignition method, for example, can control intensity,  which in turn affects scorch height, and fuel and stand  conditions are usually highly variable. Hence, experience  in conducting prescribed fires is essential in order to suc­cessfully  meet burning objectives.  Scorch height is a function of fireline intensity, am­bient  air temperature, windspeed, availability of large  fuels, tree species present, and season of year. This study  confirms Van Wagner's (1973, 1975) work in that scorch  height is correlated to the ¥l power of intensity (where  intensity equals rate of spread multiplied by total fuel  consumed multiplied by heat of combustion). Van Wag­er's  (1973) second equation, not the third, should be used  to predict scorch. Regression coefficients should be de­termined  for individual tree species rather than relying  on an average. Fireline intensity and ambient air temper­ature  account for only 68% of the variability in scorch  height for ponderosa pine in this study.  The heat which produces scorch is a time­temperature  relationship. Duff and large fuels may pro­vide  radiant heat for a longer period of time if their  moisture content is low enough to burn. For land  managers to predict scorch, they must deal with both the  initial high convective heat pulse and the lower radiant  heat that lasts for extended periods of time. Ventilation  may be important in determining the length of time that  heat may reside in the stand, hence wind flow through  the canopy should be examined when preparing for un­derstory  burning. In all of these areas, further research is  necessary.  The mortality model and predictive scorch height  equations developed in this study should be valuable  tools for planning prescribed understory fires, allowing  the land manager to use fire to meet a variety of  management objectives. Predicting ponderosa pine mor­tality  is essentially a three-step procedure. First, predict  fireline intensity using nomograms (Albini 1976) or the  computer program BEHAVE (Andrews 1986). Second, use  the intensity and ambient air temperature in Van Wag­ner's  Equation 2 to predict scorch height. Use a value of  6.9 for K, under ponderosa pine, and Van Wagner's sug­gested  average of K, - 10.0 for other tree species that  may be present. Subjectively assess how wind, available  large fuels, and ventilation will affect scorch height.  Third, use the predicted scorch height and diameter at  breast height in Equation 4 (or use Figure 1) to obtain  the probability of ponderosa pine survival. Subjectively  assess how the site condition, tree vigor, pre- and post­fire  moisture regimes, and insect and disease conditions  wi II affect mortal ity.  literature Cited  Albini, FA 1976.

L  A Growing Regime for  Containerized Western  Larch Seedlings  by David l. Wenny  R. Kasten Dumroese  Introduction  The University of Idaho College of Forestry,  Wildlife and Range Sciences operates a research nursery  producing 750,000 containerized seedlings annually. The  facility serves as a laboratory and offers practical  experience to students in agriculture, forestry and forest  nursery management. Reforestation seedlings produced  at the nursery are annually planted on state lands,  private forest industry lands, and on the University of  Idaho Experimental Forest. Field data on outplanted  seedlings, coupled with detailed crop histories  maintained by the nursery, produce feedback for future  crops. Microcomputers are used to monitor seedl ing  development and guide cultural practices, yielding  seedlings with high survivabi lity and growth.  Western larch  Western Larch (Larix occidenta lis Nutt.) is an  important timber species in the Inland Empire. Larch oc­curs  from western Montana to eastern Oregon and  Washington and northward into southern British  Columbia (Rudolf 1974). In northern Idaho thi s species  can occur in nearly pure stands or in mi xtures with  Douglas-fir and western white pine. Western larch grows  best on deep, moist, porous soils in high valleys and on  mountain slopes of northern and western exposure  (Harlow et al. 1979). Tree heights average 125 to 180  feet (38 to 55 m), and stems are 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 m)  in diameter at breast height.  This deciduous conifer begins to bear cones at  around 30 years of age, usually producing small crops  annually and large crops irregularl y. Seed production is  hampered by the effects of frost and insects. Seeds per  pound for northern Idaho western larch range from  140,000 to 175,000, with a mean of 160,000. Seed may  be transferred 750 feet (229 m) in elevation and about  0.75 degrees latitude (Rehfeldt 1983).  Western larch has been cultivated since 1881  (Rudolf 1974). The following is a synopsis of the metho­dology  used at the University of Idaho Forest Research  Nursery to produce containerized western larch  seedlings for research, conservation, and reforestation.  The Forest Research Nursery  Seedlings are grown in two 34- by lOB-foot  fiberglass greenhouses, connected by a head house. Each  house is heated by two natural gas heaters and vented  with two 4B-inch exhaust fan and louver systems. Two  24-inch ventilating fans provide air and heat circulation  through poly-tubes placed beneath the growing benches  in each house. We feel poly-tubes placed in this  manner, rather than overhead, aid in air circulation and  drying beneath the benches and allow supplemental heat  to rise through the trays. An evaporative cooling system  and shutters along the north side of the facility are used  for cooling. Photoperiod is extended by incandescent  lamps at the intensity of 500 lux.  The pH of the well water averages 6.B. Irrigation is  applied through an overhead travelling boom system.  We generally sow numerous, small lots of several  species, and the boom allows us to give specific irriga­tion,  fertilization and pesticide attention to the individual  lots. There are two booms per greenhouse, with nozzles  every 16 inches. Fertilizers and pesticides are applied  through the irrigation water by using a 1 :100 injector.  Seed Quality Tests  Each lot of seed to be grown is eva luated for quality  upon receipt. The evaluation includes seeds per pound,  purity percentage, soundness, and germination.  Seeds Per Pound  Seeds per pound are calculated by weighing five  repl ications of 100 seeds to the nearest 0.01 grams. The  mean weight is then placed into thi s equation:  45,360  Seeds per pound -------~--~----~------­mean  weight in grams of 100 seeds  Purity Percentage  Purity is determined by removing the "" debris"" from  an 8-gram (2500-seed) sample of seed. Western larch  seed can be cleaned during processing and should have  above 95-percent purity.  P  ., clean seed weight  unty y, - x 100  clean seed wt. + debris wt.  Soundness Percentage  The percentage of hollow seeds is .determined by  x-raying a 100- to 200-seed sample. This could also be  achieved by cutting the same number of seed. If more  than 5 percent of the seeds are hollow, the seed lot  should be reprocessed by pneumatic or gravity means to  eliminate the empty seeds.  Stratification and Germination Tests  The most important aspect of seed quality is how  well the seed will germinate. Seed germination is tested,  using greenhouse rather than optimum laboratory tem­perature  conditions, so that accurate amounts of seed  can be prepared for sowing.  Seed is placed into fine mesh bags and soaked 48  hours with running tap water to ensure imbibition. The  mesh bags are placed into plastic bags, and a sample of  seed is stratified for two stratification periods: 21 and 28  days at 33-36 OF (1-2 0c).  At the end of the stratification period, seed is  removed and soaked 24 hours in running tap water. Four  100-seed replicates of each lot for each stratifica-tion  period are placed into germination trays. Non­stratified  seed for each lot (four 100-seed replications) is  also germinated. Seed is germinated under 8 hours of  light at 75 of (18 0c). Cumulative counts are made at 7,  14, 21 and 28 days. At 28 days, any ungerminated seed  are cut to d'etermine if they are hollow or sound.  Sowing Calculations  After determining which stratification period gave  the highest cumulative germination at 14 days, the total  amount of seed needed for the crop can be determined.  Using probability tables (see Tinus and McDonald 1979),  the number of seeds needed per cell to achieve about  95-percent cell occupancy is determined. We then  mathematically add 0.5 seed per cell to cover handling  and sowing losses. Each lot is oversown 10 percent at  the Research Nursery. With the given germination, the  desired number of seedlings, purity, sound seed percen­tage,  and seeds per pound, we can calculate the pounds  of seed needed as follows:  (Desired seed lings) * (Oversaw factor) * (Seeds per cell)  (Seeds per pound) * (Purity percent) * (Soundness percent)  Example:  With 70-percent germination, we find from the  probability tables that 3 seeds per cell will give us 96  percent of the cells filled. To make sure we have enough  seed to account for handling and sowing losses, we add  0.5 seed per cell for an average of 3.5 seeds per cell.  2  Given: 160,000 seeds per pound, 98-percent purity,  95-percent soundness, 25,000 trees desired and  10-percent oversaw.  (25,000) * (1.1) * (3.5) 96,250  - 0.65 Ibs  (160,000) * (0.95) * (0.98) 148,960  The required amount of seed is placed into mesh  bags with no more than one-half pound per bag. The  seed is stratified as discussed above, depending on which  stratification period gave the best germination. Experience  Figure 1. Growing Regime for \r\Iestern larch.

Growing Regime (Fig. 1)  Environmental Monitoring  The basic environmental factors are minimum and  maximum temperature, medium temperature, humidity,  and the pH and electrical conductivity of irrigation, ferti­gat  ion water (irrigation water with injected liquid fertilizer  in solution), and leachate from the growing medium.  August September October November  Four maximum/minimum thermometers are placed  throughout the greenhouse to record the daily tempera­ture  range, and a hygrothermograph charts the tempera­ture  and relative humidity patterns on a weekly basis.  Medium temperatures are obtained with a soil thermome­ter.  Irrigation and fertigation water are monitored to keep  the applied solution between pH 5.5 and 6.0. Growing  medium leachate is monitored also to detect increases in  medium pH. Leachate conductivity will indicate any seri­ous  increases in salt accumulation within the medium  that may become detrimental to the seedlings. Timus and  McDonald (1979) discuss these topics and instruments in  great detail, including calibration of hygrothermographs.

This regime  produces seed lings averaging 20 cm in height, 2.8 to 3.2  mm in caliper, with well-formed buds and high root  growth potential (Fig. 2). Many Idaho sites may be  subjected to three months of drought after the seedlings  are planted. We feel the short heights rendered by this  regime are a distinct advantage in preventing disease  within the greenhouse and in plantation success.  Container Type, Growing Medium, and  Tray Filling  Western larch is grown in 4-cubic-inch Ray Leach  Pine Cells, which have 200 cells per tray, or 100 cells  per square foot. Seedlings can also be produced in  styrofoam containers. In general, seedlings with larger  root collar diameters can be produced in containers with  wider spacing between cells. Before sowing, previously  used trays and cells are thoroughly washed and dipped  into a 10-percent bleach solution (1 part laundry bleach  to 9 parts water). After the trays and cells have dried, the  bottom 1 inch of the cells is remoistened with tap water,  and the tray and cells are run through the filling machine.  Moistening the bottom of the cells causes dry growing  medium to adhere and not fall through the drainage  holes. Cells are machine-filled with a SOISO-percent peat­vermiculite  growing medium. The pH of this mix aver­ages  about 4.2. Seeds are sown with a vacuum seeder  and covered with about l i S-to 3/B-inch of either Target  Forestry Sand® or washed white grit.  Germination Phase  Once sowing is complete, the containers are irrigated  until the medium is thoroughly moist. Phosphoric acid is  injected into the irrigation water to adjust pH to around  6.0. Light mists of acidified irrigation water are applied to  keep the zone around the germinating seeds slightly  moist.  Some germinants may show symptoms of damping-off  fungi. Common fungi associated with damping-off include  Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytopthora, and Fusarium. Sym­ptoms  of damping-off are rotted stems at the groundline,  often with an apparently healthy top lying on its side.  The germinant, and preferably the entire cell, should be  removed from the greenhouse to prevent disease spread.  Irrigation water can cause spores to splash to other see­dlings,  thereby spreading the disease. Disease incidence  declines as soon as the stems begin to lignify, generally  in 3 to 4 weeks (Tinus and McDonald 1979). At the  Research Nursery, we rely on these proper cultural prac­tices  to reduce damping-off: maintaining low medium pH  with acidified irrigation water, using grit to allow air cir­culation  around the root collar zone, keeping relative  humidity low, delaying nitrogen fertilization until germi­nation  is complete, and using medium fungicide  4  drenches. We apply one application of the fungicide  Banrol""' (a soil drench) at 4 ounces per 100 gallons im­mediately  after germination is complete as a preventative  method against root rots.  Seedlings with retained seed coats may show  symptoms of Fusarium cotyledon blight, needle necrosis  originating at the retained seed coat. These seedlings are  promptly removed to prevent spread of Fusarium and to  rid the growing area of dead seedlings, which may host  disease organisms.  Cells are thinned to one seedling by removing the ex­tra  germinants with tweezers or fingers as soon as the  majority of seedlings have shed their seed coats.  Thinning is more efficient if done before lateral root  development. Seed coats with high germination energy  tend to shed their seed coats rapidly.  Germination is generally complete within 10 to 14  days, and seed coats are shed within 21 days, at which  time the seedlings enter the ""initial growth phase:'  Initial Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to develop root systems  on the germinants. Large concentrations of phosphorous  and potassium are applied to achieve the desired growth.  Nutrients are applied during each twice-weekly  irrigation to meet targeted growth (Fig. 3). During the  initial growth phase, week 2 through week 8, we inject a  liquid fertilizer solution of Peters Conifer Starter'""  (7-40-17) at a rate of 65 ppm N and calcium nitrate  (15 .5-0-0-10) at a rate of 23 ppm N, supplemented with  phosphoric acid to adjust fertigation water pH to below  6.0 (Table 1).  During this growth phase, day temperatures of  7S-80°F (24-27""C) and night temperatures around 65 OF  (18 OC) are maintained. Medium temperature (recorded at  8 a.m. daily) averages 68 OF (20 OC). Photoperiod is ex­tended  to 18 hours. At the end of week 8, the medium is  leached with copious amounts of irrigation water to re­move  any salt build-up. Also during week 8, seedling  foliage is tested for nutrient concentrations to detect any  deficiencies.  Weather conditions, particularly the amount of  sunshine, have a strong influence on initial growth of  seedlings. Weekly height and caliper (root collar  diameter) measurements are taken on 10 predetermined  sample trees within each lot. If height growth is occuring  faster than our target growth curve, rates of applied nitro­gen  are reduced by lowering the rate of applied calcium  nitrate to about 12 ppm. Conversely, if growth is behind  targeted levels, rates of applied nitrogen are increased by  increasing the rate of applied calcium nitrate to 46 ppm.  During this phase, seedlings may show Fusarium root  rot symptoms: chlorotic needles that turn necrotic, result­ing  in the seedling turning brown to red-brown and dy­ing.  The seedling tip may also wilt into a shepherd's  crook. Infected seedlings and cells should be removed as  soon as evident.  24  22  20  18  16  ~  U 14  Z  .... 12  J:  \.?

Bud Initiation and  Root Collar Diameter Growth  The objective of this phase is to withhold nutrients  and moisture, creating a stressed condition in the  seed lings so that height growth will cease, terminal buds  will develop, and root collar diameter will increase. Be­ginning  in week 9, the seedlings are removed from the  twice weekly irrigation/fertilization schedule. Levels of  applied nitrogen are eliminated (Table 2).  Seedlings are now irrigated only when medium has  become barely moist. Our greenhouse technicians daily  select seedlings at random, remove the root plug from the  cell, and visually examine and feel the medium for dry­ness.  Although quite subjective, we feel this method has  some advantages. One advantage is that disease and in­sects  can be surveyed at the same time, and by random  selection, the seedlings that are seldom examined due to  inaccessibility are also checked. By inspecting the root  plug, we also gain some insight into how the root system  is developing.  The extended photoperiod is discontinued. Day  temperatures are set for 60-70°F (16-21 ""C) and night tem­peratures  for 50-60 OF (10-16 ""C). We maintain medium  temperatures between 62-68 OF (17-20 oq with these air  temperature ranges.  Research at the nursery has found that western larch  go through a ""coasting"" phase, during which the  seedlings continue to grow, regardless of nutrient applica­tions  or moisture conditions. Generally, 8 to 10 weeks  later, or week 15 through week 17, the larch begin to set  terminal buds.

Our larch generally  give us a 100-percent increase in height as they ""coast""  through this phase.  The western larch generally do not look severely  chlorotic during this growth period. Seedlings may wilt  during the heat of the day. We apply cooling mist to the  seedlings, and they respond by regaining turgor. We may  allow the larch seedlings to wilt like this for 2 or 3 days  in a row in an attempt to dry down the medium until it  is barely moist. We feel this helps with lateral bud de­velopment  and eventually signals the seedling to induce  terminal bud formation.  It is important to realize this ""coasting"" effect. Our  research indicates that no cultural practice short of induc­ing  mortality will stop height growth, although  photoperiod control by shading may be a method. Plan  for the ""coast"" height increases by switching to the bud  initiation phase before the seedlings are at desired  heights. Larch will ""coast"" to desired heights without  giving you the frustration of watching the crop increase in  height with no alternatives for stopping growth.  Cold-Hardiness Induction Phase  The objective of this phase is to physiologically  prepare the trees for freezing temperatures. We accom­plish  this by subjecting the trees to ambient temperatures  and thus allowing normal cold hardiness to develop. The  western larch will look slightly chlorotic. As early as the  first of October, lots may begin to show a purplish color  to their needles as an indicator of carbohydrate accumula­tion  and the beginning of physiological changes preparing  the seedling for winter.  ,  Table 2.

Beginning around mid-October, we allow air  temperatures within the greenhouse to go to ambient  (Figure 1). Temperatures remain about ambient until the  seed lings are packed for cold storage in January.  However, the minimum temperature allowed in the  greeohouses is 28 OF (- 2 OC), and the root plug is not  allowed to remain frozen. From late October until the  trees are put into cold storage, irrigation is necessary only  about once every 3 to 4 weeks. During these irrigations,  calcium nitrate is applied at a rate of 46 ppm N. These  act as a nutrient reserve within the medium for use by  the tree once it is outplanted.  From mid-October until the seedlings are shipped for  planting, infection by Botrytis is inevitable. The symptoms  are webs of gray to gray-brown mycelium growing on  ana ""ound dead and dying needles that have ei ther  f ~ en irom the seedlings or are still attached. Tan or  brown-watery stem lesions may also be present. Levels of  Botrytis will increase as needles begin to drop.  Careful crop sanitation is the greatest asset in fighting the  fungus. Seedlings killed by Fusarium root disease should  be removed immediately, especially taller seedlings that  may have died during the stress period.  These seedlings provide a superb microsite for  Botrytis development. We find that careful sanitation  keeps infection under control. Spot outbreaks of the dis­ease  can often be eliminated by removing the infected  7  dead needles and the surrounding dead needles from the  trays in a one-tray radius. If part of the crop is shipped  for fall planting, spreading the remaining trays apart to in­crease  air circulation also reduces fungal incidence.  Fungicides can be used if the outbreak is severe or  sanitation was not observed. Applications of Captan'"" or  Benlate'"" may bring control. Unfortunately, chemical con­trol  without proper sanitation may just postpone disease  occurrence until the seed lings are placed into cold  storage.  Extraction and Cold Storage  Seedlings are well watered before being removed  from their containers and wrapped with a Saran-like  plastic in bundles of 25. The sti cki ness of the plastic  keeps the bundle firmly packed, which maintains plug in­tegrity  and prevents moisture loss. Bundles of trees for  public conservation sales are placed four to a poly-bag  (100 seed lings total), which is sealed before going to  refrigerated storage. Bundles of trees for large reforestation  working agreements are placed into poly-lined wax boxes  that also are sealed airtight before placing in cold storage.  The refrigerated storage is kept at 33-34 of (.05-1 OC) with  relative humidity near 100 percent. Seedlings have been  stored successfully in this manner for 5 months without  the need for irrigation.  .  Seedlings in cold storage are routinely inspected for  disease problems. Botrytis is the most serious disease.  Preventative methods are the best way to control this  problem and include the following: (1) pull, wrap and  store only vigorous, disease-free seedlings; (2) store see­dlings  for the shortest duration possible; (3) routinely in­spect  a sample of each lot, especially lots containing  significant quantities of dead needles, as these can be an  initial food base for the pathogen; (4) immediately ship  seedlings showing mold problems if possible (Sutherland  and Van Eerden 1980). Mold growth can also be reduced  by dropping the storage temperature for fully hardened  seedlings to below freezing.  Conclusion  This regime has been very successful. Requested  quantities of seedlings meeting strict physiological and  morphological requirements are achieved or exceeded  with a minimum oversow. Seedlings grown under this re­gime  average 20 cm in height and 2.8 to 3.2 mm in  caliper. First year outplanting survival on the University of  Idaho Experimental Forest has exceeded 94 percent each  of the past 6 years, and seedlings are 35 to 45 cm tall af­ter  one growing season. Some 4-year-old larch have been  over 3 meters tall. We feel the most important aspect of  any growing regime is continually monitoring the seedling  growth as the regime progresses. Height and caliper  measurements can then be used to modify or change the  8  regime as the growth of the seedlings dictates during one  growing season and between growing seasons. This re­gime  has been developed from 6 years of records on fer­tilizer  application rates and the resulting seedling growth,  and will certainly be modified in the pursuit of high­quality  western larch seedlings  Literature Cited  Harlow, W.M., E.5.

'-\1  Y\D .sA  The Grazed-Class Method to  Estimate Forage Utilization  on Transitory Forest  Rangelands  James L. Kingery, Carol Boyd  and Peggy E. Kingery  Introduction  Grazing of forested lands in the Pacific  Northwest has been included in forest resource  management strategies since the turn of the  century (Tisdale 1961 ). Many of the areas grazed  are transitory in nature, that is, sites where the  natural forest community has been removed due to  harvesting, fire or some other disturbance. Seral  shrubs and herbaceous vegetation now flourish.  While successional processes are restoring the site  to forestland, such areas can provide considerable  support of animal use for up to 40 years (Kingery  1987). This fact may have considerable appeal to  private land owners, especially during times when  the timber market is poor (Adams 1975).  As on traditional rangelands, it is necessary to  monitor vegetation on transitory rangeland to  ensure proper use of the resource and attainment  of management objectives. Proper use is defined  by the Society for Range Management as ""the  degree and time of use of current year's growth  which, if continued, will either maint3in or improve  the range condition consistent with conservation  of other natural resources."" (Range Term Glossary  Committee 1989). Proper use, when applied to an  individual species, refers to the season and  amount of use that can occur without interfering  with that species' ability to provide for its own  needs. When applied to a plant community,  proper use refers to the season and level of use  that can occur without jeopardizing the long-term  health of the plant community (Stoddart et al.  1975). When land is not managed for proper use,  plant vigor and forage production can decrease  and the trend in range condition can decline. In  contrast, an increase in the food manufacturing  leaf surface, an improvement in litter cover, and  an increase in forage quality and quantity result  when proper use guidelines are followed.  On transitory rangelands, especially in northern  Idaho, the primary use is generally for timber  production. As such, tree seedling establishment  and maintenance of range condition are the chief  concerns. On these sites, therefore, proper use is  1  the degree and time of use of forage plants that  will not only maintain or improve the condition of  the forage resource, but also be consistent with  goals for forest regeneration.  For proper use to be achieved, animal use  must be monitored. While there are many methods  of estimating forage utilization, most have been  developed for use on traditional rangelands and  may not be completely applicable to transitory  rangelands. In addition, they can be time­consuming  and require extensive training to  produce acceptable results. For these reasons,  there is a need for a reliable procedure to estimate  utilization that is accurate, rapid and easily  learned. The grazed-class method developed by  Schmutz, Holt and Michaels (1963) meets this  need.  Background for the Grazed-Class  Method  The grazed-class method of estimating forage  utilization was developed for and tested on arid  rangelands in the Southwest, but appears to have  considerable potential in forested settings of the  Pacific Northwest as well (Boyd 1987). It was  designed to provide range resource managers with  an accurate and easy-to-use tool to monitor  livestock utilization of selected forage species.  The procedure is based on the concept that when  one or more key species of an area representative  of a larger range type have been properly utilized,  optimum use of that rangeland has been made  (Stoddart et al. 1975). The method classifies  grazed plants into utilization classes, based on the  percent of total plant weight removed. The  classes are 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90-percent use  (Fig. 1 ). Photographic guides, developed from  height-weight relations of the chosen species (Fig.  2), are used to guide the examiner in placing  grazed plants into their respective utilization  classes.  The photo guides for use on transitory  rangelands were developed according 1to the  procedure of Schmutz (1978) with some  modifications. These modifications were  necessary because of the variability of growth  characteristics encountered within the plant  species tested. This variability was primarily due to  the heterogeneous growing conditions typical of  forest environments as compared to the more  homogeneous conditions found in the Southwest  desert grasslands for which the photo guides were  originally developed.  0% 10% 30% 50% 70% 90%  Fagure 1. Utilization classes based on the percent of total plant weight removed.  Development of Photo Guides for  Transitory Rangelands  The factors involved in choosing the key  management area and for selecting the key  species to monitor are critical for the development  of the photo guides. According to Schmutz  (1978), key management areas for livestock  production are located at intermediate distances  from water but not where livestock naturally  congregate. Key species are defined as those that  are both abundant in the plant community and  important components of the livestock diet.  Determination of Key Management Areas  For purposes of developing and testing the  photo guides for transitory rangelands, key areas  were located in the Douglas-fir/ninebark  (Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus malvaceus),  Douglas-fir/snowberry (Pseudotsuga  menziesii/Symphoricarpos a/bus), grand  fir/queenscup beadlily (Abies grandis/Ciintonia  uniflora), and western redcedar/queenscup beadlily  ( Thuja plicata/Ciintonia uniflora) habitat types  (Boyd 1987). The four habitat types selected  represent a wide range of environmental  conditions common to transitory rangelands in the  Pacific Northwest, and possess a high potential for  both timber and forage production. The specific  sites for observation were selected primarily for  the variability in the vegetation; however,  differences in slope, soil type and aspect were also  considered.  Determination of Key Management  Species  Forage species meeting the criteria of  abundance and dietary importance for key species  designation in the Douglas-fir, grand fir and  western redcedar habitat types are: Idaho fescue  2  (Festuca idahoensis), meadow foxtail (Aiopecurus  pratensis), timothy (Phleum pratense), bluebunch  wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), pinegrass  (Calamagrostis rubescens), slender hairgrass  (Deschampsia elongata), and orchardgrass  (Dactylis glomerata) . The selections were guided  by personal experiences and the suggestions of  range users and management agency personnel.  1- :r  38  25  20  Q 15  w  :r  10  5  Height-weight curve  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100  WEIGHT  Figure 2. Height of typical grass plant with  corresponding percent weights representing the grazed  classes.  Photo Guide Development  The most important consideration in  developing accurate photo guides is a close  correlation between grazed-class percentages and  the height-weight relations of the plant  photographed.  To begin, an • average plant"" for each species  was determined. Eight to 12 plants representative  of the species and within a normal range of  growth (eliminating height and production  extremes) were collected. The weight of each  plant was determined at specified heights by  clipping and weighing; the averages of these  measurements were used as the basis for height­weight  curves for each plant. To determine the  height of a specific grazed class (0, 10, 30, 50,  70 and 90-percent weight removed), the height of  the ""average plant"" corresponding to that grazed  class was used.  Once an ""average plant"" for a given species  was determined, a representative of that species  was located in the management area. The plant  was clipped to the heights corresponding to the  various grazed classes. Photographs were taken  of the plant at each height. All plant clippings  were individually bagged and weighed to  determine the weight distribution for the different  grazed classes. For the plants photographed,  height was plotted against weight percent. This  graph was compared with the graph of the  ""average plant.""  Due to a large variation in growing conditions  at the sites, the photographed plants often did not  exactly fit the height-weight curve of the ""average  plant."" To account for this variation, 99-percent  confidence limits were used with the regression  line of the graph to produce a range of values for  the ""average plant"" (Fig. 3). If the values of the  photographed plant were within the confidence  limits of the height-weight curve for a given  species, it was accepted as a representation of the  ""average."" The photo guide was then created  from the photograph series to represent different  grazing intensities.  Applications for the Grazed-Class  Photo Guides  Utilization  The grazed-class photo guides provide a  standard for plant height comparison. Because the  photo guides estimate utilization based on the  amount of forage removed, variations in height  (and weight) due to irregular plant use are  3  automatically adjusted for by the eye, while  variations in height growth due to site  characteristics or seasonal precipitation can be  disregarded (Schmutz 1978). In turn, the  accuracy of the estimate is increased and the  required calculations are reduced.  Assessing proper use  The upper limit of livestock utilization on  transitory sites will vary, depending upon the  stage of reforestation and forage availability. In  the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest, the  first four years for naturally regenerated tree  seedlings and the first two years for transplanted  tree seedlings are generally considered the most  critical periods (Roath and Krueger 1982).  Livestock utilization during these critical periods  should be well distributed and not exceed 25% to  30% of the standing crop (Kingery et al. 1987).  As the tree seedlings mature, livestock utilization  can be increased in accordance with forage  availability. Studies in central and northern Idaho  and in Oregon have indicated that utilization not  exceeding 60% will maintain desirable forage  conditions in most transitory range settings during  the forest rotation period (Kingery 1987; Young et  al. 1967; Doescher et al. 1987).  30~------------------------~  -c  I-I  15  CJ  w  I  10  5  \  \ \  \ \  \ \  \ \  \ '  ' ' ' '  10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100  WEIGHT(%)  Figure 3. Height-weight curve with 99% confidence  limits.  Other Estimates Which May Be Obtained  As discussed by Schmutz (1978), the grazed  class method can also be used to estimate  stocking rates, grazing capacity, distribution of  grazing and economics of range improvements.  These parameters have not as yet been evaluated  in transitory rangeland settings, however. Possible  applications of this method on forested sites  would be to make interim seasonal adjustments in  stocking rates; to determine grazing distribution  problems due to water source locations, soil,  slope, etc.; and to aid in the assessment of  economic benefits of improvements made to  increase grazing capacity.  Range of Application  While the photo guides were developed for  seven important forage species in the four habitat  types studied (Boyd 1987), they can also provide  a reliable index for livestock utilization in other  transitory rangeland types. Our observations  support those of Schmutz (1978) in that the photo  guides are not restricted to only the community  types in which they were developed. There is  generally as much variation in plant form on a  given site as between sites, and these variations  are averaged out with large samples.  The grazed-class method is an accurate and  rapid means of estimating forage utilization, and  its application for monitoring utilization is shown  to be well suited to transitory rangelands in the  Intermountain West.  Instructions for Use  The sampling procedure for this method is fast  (a 1 00-plant sample requires from 30 to 60  minutes); therefore, it is possible to sample  multiple sites in a short time. The calculations to  determine utilization are simple and can be done  on location or later. If the area to be sampled is  large, it may be necessary to stratify it into  smaller, more homogeneous sampling units based  primarily on differences in vegetation and soils.  Each unit would then be sampled independently.  One species should be sampled at a time using a  toe-pace transect set diagonally across the  sampling unit. This technique reduces the  probability of sampling the same plant twice and  includes most of the variability within the unit.  To estimate current utilization, either 50 or  1 00 samples of individual plants of each key  species may be used. By referring to the photo  guides the appendix, determine which grazed-class  the plant falls into and record that in the dot count  block on the data sheet (Fig. 4). After the desired  4  number of plants are recorded, convert the tallies  to percentage of grazed plants by classes. If 50  samples were taken, double the dot tallies for the  recorded number. Then record the number of  plants occurring in each grazed class in the column  labelled •No. By Class• (C). Next, multiply the  grazed-class percent (P) by (C) to obtain the  number by class percent and record this figure in  the column labelled •No. By Class %• (CP).  Finally, divide the total amount in column (CP) by  the total amount in column (C) to obtain the  average utilization of the plant species.  Very little formal training is required to use the  grazed-class method effectively. Instruction  should include an explanation of the theory behind  the method as well as practice sessions in the  field. According to Schmutz (1978), consistent  results can be obtained with only two hours  experience, although personnel inexperienced with  the procedure or personnel who have not used the  method for some time often underestimated use of  the heavier grazed plants. Studies in northern  Idaho have shown that inexperienced samplers  overestimated utilization when livestock use of the  site was minimal (Boyd 1987).•  UTILIZATION STUDY DATA  GRAZED CLASS METHOD  I I  Studv Numher I Date IEYaminer  _Allotment Name & Number  I  Kind/Class of Livestock !Period of Use  Le~al Des~riotion  Key Species Key Species Key Species  Grazed  Class INo by INo X !No by !No I INo by !No X  Percents Dot IClass !Class J Dot !Class !Class J Dot !Class !Class J  lP) CountJ 1C) I(C)(p) Count I (C) I (C) (p) Count I (C) I(C)(p)  I I I I I I  0 I I I I I I  I I I I I I  I I I I I I  10 I I I I I I  I I I I 1 l  I I I I I I  30 I I I I I I  I I I I I I  I I I I I I  50 I I I I I I  I I 1 I 1 1  I I I I I I  70 I I I I I I  l 1 I I I I  I I I I I I  90 I I I I I I  I I I I I I  I I I I I I  Totals I I Totals I I Totals I I  I 1 1 1 1 J  Ave. E (C) (P) Ave. Ave.  Util. :: =-= Util. = -= Util. = -=  E (C)  Notes:  Figure 4.

Habitat Suitability Index Procedure for Columbian Sharp-tailed Grouse,"Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) occupy &lt;10 percent of their historic range.  Because of recent increases in some sharp-tailed grouse populations, improved range condition, and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), interest in transplanting Columbian sharp-tailed grouse into historic range within the state of Idaho and surrounding Western States has increased.  Unfortunately, a habitat suitability index (HSI) to systematically evaluate and rank potential release sites for the Columbian subspecies is not available.  Therefore, after evaluating the HSI for the plans sharp-tailed grouse (T. p. jamesi), we developed an index more applicable to the Columbian subspecies.  Four areas in southeastern Idaho, All known to support viable populations of sharp-tailed grouse, were chosen to develop the procedure.  The HSI is divided into 2 components, each representing a seasonal habitat of Columbian sharp-tailed grouse.  Both winter food/cover habitat and nest/brood cover habitat were evaluated using the concept of percent equivalent optimum area.  The equivalent optimum area concept assumes that a large area of low quality can have a habitat value equivalent to a smaller area of higher quality.  Our HSI provides a systematic method to evaluate habitat quality for Columbian sharp-tailed grouse.  It can also provide values which are compatible with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services' Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP).  The HSI can also be used to determine the amount of mitigation crediting a particular site may provide and be used by biologists without considerable experience in sharp-tailed grouse biology.","Meints, Daryl R.; Connelly, John W.; Reese, Kerry P.; Sands, Alan R.; Hemker, Thomas P.",,1992-11-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Bulletin Number 55,"Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b55,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

The Role of Recreation and Leisure Travel in Idaho's Economy,"Recreation and other leisure travel spending appear to be increasingly significant contributors to Idaho's economic health.  This is especially true in particular communities and subregions in the state, such as Sandpoint, Coeur d'Alene, McCall, Sun Valley, and travel corridors such as those in southeastern Idaho that access the Yellowstone-Teton complex.  This study considers spending by recreation and leisure travelers in Idaho and the contribution of this spending to the state through economic diversification and rural economic development.  We first present the framework for our analysis, including Idaho's economic base, spatial features of the Idaho economy, and the economic role of recreation and leisure travel in Idaho.  This discussion of that role requires an understanding of the importance of both basic and service industries in Idaho's amenity economy.  That economy includes the spending by 'traditional tourists' (out-of-region visitors traveling for recreation or pleasure), convention travelers, and residents from particular Idaho regions active in leisure and recreation pursuits within those regions, as well as retirees, the independently wealthy and residents who are 'footloose,' or location-independent in their occupations.  Finally, that economy also includes interstate trade generated by amenity resources in Idaho's economy.  We then focus on our assessment of the extent to which expenditures by traditional tourists, in-region leisure travelers and convention travelers contribute to the Idaho economy, describing the results of a study conducted to collect these expenditure data and their use in three models of Idaho's regional economies.  The report concludes with a discussion of the major conclusions that can be drawn from our research.","Harris, Charles C.; Robison, M.H.",,1992-12-01,,"University of Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station",Bulletin Number 56,"Idaho SD12.I2 U47, University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/","College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences;",uifwre-b56,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

Wenny  R. Kasten Dumroese  Introduction  The University of Idaho, College of Forestry, Wildlife  and Range Sciences operates a research nursery  producing 750,000 containerized seedlings annually. The  faci I ity serves as a laboratory and offers practical  experience to students in agriculture, forestry and forest  nursery management. Reforestation seedlings produced at  the nursery are annually planted on state lands, private  forest industry lands, and on the University of Idaho  Experimental Forest. Field data on outplanted seedlings,  coupled with detailed crop histories maintained by the  nursery, produce feedback for future crops.  Microcomputers are used to monitor seedling  development and guide cultural practices yielding  seedlings with high survivability and growth.  Ponderosa Pine  One of the most important timber species in the  western United States is ponderosa pine (pinus  ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws). In northern Idaho this  species occurs from 2000 to 7000 feet (610 to 2135 m).  Ponderosa pine is not exacting in soil requirements, but  does best on moist sites (Harlow et al. 1979). Tree  heights average 60 to 180 feet (18 to 55 m) and stems  are 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.2 m) in diameter at breast height.  This two- or three-needled pine begins to bear cones  around 20 years of age, usually prodUCing small crops  annually and large crops every 5 to 7 years. Seeds per  pound for northern Idaho ponderosa pine range from  8,500 to 12,000, with a mean of 10,000. Seed may be  transferred 750 feet (229 m) in elevation and 0.75  degrees latitude (Rehfeldt 1980).  Ponderosa pine has been cultivated since 1826  (Krugman & Jenkinson 1974). The following is a synopsis  of the methodology used at the University of Idaho  Forest Research Nursery to produce containerized  ponderosa pine seedlings for research, conservation,  and reforestation.  The Forest Research Nursery  Seedlings are grown in two 34- by 108-foot fiberglass  greenhouses, connected by a head house. Each house is  heated by two natural gas heaters and vented with two  48-inch exhaust fan and louver systems. Two 24-inch  ventilating fans provide air and heat circulation through  poly-tubes placed beneath the growing benches in each  house. We feel poly-tubes placed in this manner - rath­er  than overhead-aid in air circulation and drying be­neath  the benches and allow supplemental heat to rise  through the trays. An evaporative cooling system and  shutters along the north side of the facility are used for  cooling. Photoperiod is extended by incandescent lamps  at an intensity of 500 lux.  The pH of the well water averages 6.8. Irrigation is  applied through an overhead travelling boom system. We  generally sow numerous small lots of several species, and  the boom allows us to give specific irrigation,  fertilization and pesticide attention to the individual lots.  There are two booms per greenhouse, with nozzles every  16 inches. Fertilizers and pesticides are applied through  the irrigation water by using a 1:100 injector.  Seed Quality Tests  Each lot of seed is evaluated for quality upon re­ceipt.  The evaluation includes seeds per pound, purity  percentage, soundness, and germination.  Seeds Per Pound  Seeds per pound are calculated by weighing five  repl ications of 100 seeds to the nearest 0.01 grams. The  mean weight is then placed into this equation:  Seeds per pound _ 45360  mean weight in grams of 100 seeds  Purity Percentage  Purity is determined by removing the ""debris"" from a  90-gram 12500-seed) sample of seed. Ponderosa pine  seed is easily cleaned during processing and should have  at least 99-percent purity. Thus:  Purity % -  clean seed wt.  x 100  clean seed wt. + debris wt.  Soundness Percentage  The percentage of hollow seeds is determined by x­raying  a 100- to 200-seed sample. This could also be  achieved by cutting the same number of seeds. If more  than 3 percent of the seeds are hollow, the seed lot  should be reprocessed by pneumatic or gravitational  means to eliminate the empty seeds.  Stratification and Germination Tests  The most important aspect of seed quality is how  well the seed will germinate. Seed germination is tested,  using greenhouse rather than optimum laboratory  temperature conditions, so that accurate amounts of seed  can be prepared for sowing.  We bleach-treat ponderosa pine seed prior to  stratification. Past experience with seed of unknown  collection method or handling necessitated chemically  treating seed coats to reduce the incidence of disease  fungi. Although the treatment does not eradicate all  organisms on the seed coat Uames and Genz 1981), we  feel it helps reduce early seedling mortality when used  with proper cultural methods, while not detrimentally  affecting germination. The seed sample is placed into a  fine mesh bag and soaked in a 40-percent bleach  solution (2 parts common laundry bleach (5.25% sodium  hypochlorite) to 3 parts tap water) for 10 minutes with  hand agitation (Wenny and Dumroese 1987). The  agitation is important to ensure complete sterilization.  Seed is then thoroughly rinsed to remove all bleach and  soaked 48 hours with running tap water to ensure  imbibition. The mesh bags are placed into plastic bags  and a sample of seed is stratified for each of three  stratification periods: 40, 45 and 60 days at 33-36° F (1-2°  0.  At the end of the stratification period, seed is  removed and soaked 24 hours in running tap water. Four  100-seed replicates of each lot for each stratification  period are placed into germination trays. Non-stratified  seed for each lot (four 100-seed replications) is also  germinated. Seed is germinated under 8 hours light at  750 F (240 C) and 16 hours dark at 65° F (180 C).  Cumulative counlS are made at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. At  28 days, any ungerminated seed are cut to determine if  they are hollow or sound.  Sowing Calculations  After determining which stratification period gave the  highest cumulative germination at 14 days, the total  amount of seed needed for the crop can be determined.  Using probabi lity tables (see Tinus and McDonald 1979),  the number of seed needed per cell to achieve around  95-percent cell occupancy is determined. We then  mathematically add 0.5 seed per cell to cover handling  and sowing losses. Each lot is oversown 10 percent at the  Research Nursery. With a given germination, the desired  number of seed lings, purity, sound seed percentage, and  seeds per pound, we calculate the pounds of seed  needed as follows:  (Desired seedlings) • (Oversow fador) • (Seeds per cell)  (Seeds per pound) • (Purity percent) • (Soundness percent)  2  Example:  With 80-percent germination, from the probability  tables we find that 2 seeds per cell will give us 96  percent of the cells filled. To make sure we have enough  seed to account for handling and sowing losses, we add  0.5 seed per cell for an average of 2.5 seeds per cell.  Given: 10,000 seeds per pound, 99-percent purity,  97-percent soundness, 25,000 trees desired and  10-percent oversow.

The required amount of seed is placed into mesh  bags with no more than two pounds per bag. The seed  is surface sterilized and stratified as discussed previously,  depending on which stratification period gave the best  germination. Experience at the nursery shows most  ponderosa pine lots perform best with 40 days of cold  stratification.  Growing Regime (Fig. 1)  Environmental Monitoring  The basic environmental factors are minimum and  maximum temperature, medium temperature, humidity,  and the pH and electrical conductivity of irrigation,  fertigation water (irrigation water with injected liquid  July August September October  fertilizer in solution), and leachate from the growing  medium.  Four maximum/minimum thermometers are placed  throughout the greenhouse to record the daily  temperature range, and a hygrothermograph charts the  temperature and relative humidity patterns on a weekly  basis. Medium temperatures are obtained with a soil  thermometer. Irrigation and fertigation water are  monitored to keep the applied solution between pH 5.5  and 6.0. Growing medium leachate is also monitored to  detect increases in medium pH. Leachate conductivity  will indicate any serious increases in salt accumulation  within the medium that may become detrimental to the  seedlings. Tinus and McDonald (1979) discuss these  topics and instruments in great detail, including calibra­tion  of hygrothermographs.

This  regime produces seedlings averaging 15 cm in height, 2.8  to 3.2 mm in caliper, with well-formed buds and high  root growth potential (Fig. 2). Many Idaho sites may be  subjected to three months of drought after the seedlings  are planted. We feel the short heights rendered by this  regime are a distinct advantage in plantation success.  Container Type, Growing Medium, and Tray  Filling  Ponderosa pine is grown in 4-cubic-inch Ray Leach  Pine Cells, which have 200 cells per tray or 100 cells per  square foot. Seedlings can also be produced in styrofoam  containers. In general, seedlings with larger root collar  diameters can be produced in containers with wider  spacing between cells. Before sowing. previously used  trays and cells are thoroughly washed and dipped into a  10-percent bleach solution (1 part laundry bleach to 9  parts water). After the trays and cells have dried, the  bottom 1 inch of the cells is remoistened with tap water  and the tray and cells run through the filling machine.  Moistening the bottom of the cells causes dry growing  medium to adhere and not fall through the drainage  holes. Cells are machine filled with a 50/50 percent  peat-vermiculite growing medium. The pH of this mix  averages around 4.2. Seeds are sown with a vacuum  seeder and covered with about lI5-3/8-inch of either  Target Forestry Sand'"" or washed white grit.  Germination Phase  Once sowing is complete, the containers are  irrigated until the medium is thoroughly moist.  Phosphoric acid is injected into the irrigation water to  adjust pH to around 6.0. Light mists of acidified irrigation  water are applied to keep the zone around the  germinating seeds slightly moist. Vigorous lots of  ponderosa pine show through the grit in as little as three  days.  Some germinants may show symptoms of damping­off  fungi. Common fungi associated with damping-off  include Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytopthora, and  Fusarium. Symptoms of damping-off are rotted stems at  the groundline, often with an apparently healthy top  lying on its side. The germinant, and preferably the  entire cell, should be removed from the greenhouse to  prevent disease spread. Irrigation water can cause spores  to splash to other seedlings, thereby spreading the  disease. Disease incidence declines as soon as the stems  begin to lignify, generally in 3 to 4 weeks (Tinus and  McDonald 1979).  4  At the Research Nursery we rely on these proper  cultural practices to reduce damping-off: maintaining low  medium pH with acidified irrigation water, using grit to  allow air circulation around the root collar zone, keeping  relative humidity low, delaying nitrogen fertilization until  germination is complete, and using medium fungicide  drenches. We apply one application of the fungicide  Banrot'"" (a soil drench) at 4 ounces per 100 gallons  immediately after germination is complete as a  preventative method against root rots.  Seedlings with retained seed coats may show  symptoms of Fusarium cotyledon blight, needle necrosis  orginating at the retained seed coat. These seedlings are  promptly removed to prevent spread of Fusarium and to  rid the growing area of dead seedlings which may host  disease organisms.  Cells are thinned to one seedling by removing the  extra germinants with tweezers or fingers as soon as the  majority of seedlings have shed their seed coats.  Ponderosa pine seedlings develop lateral roots rapidly,  and thinning is more efficient if done before lateral root  development. Seed lots with high germination energy  tend to shed their seed coats rapidly.  Germination is generally complete within 10 to 14  days, and seed coats are shed within 21 days, at which  time the seedlings enter the ""initial growth phase:'  Initial Growth Phase  The objective of this phase is to develop root systems  on the germinants, making them capable of incorporating  large amounts of nutrients and producing rapid shoot  growth during the accelerated growth phase. Large  concentrations of phosphorous and potassium are  applied to achieve the desired growth.  Nutrients are applied during each twice-weekly  irrigation to meet target growth (Fig. 3). During the  initial growth phase, week 2 through week 6, we inject a  liquid fertilizer solution of Peters Conifer Startet'""  (7-40-17) at a rate of 65 ppm N and calcium nitrate  (15.5-0-0-10) at a rate of 23 ppm N supplemented with  phosphoric acid to adjust fertigation water pH to below  6.0 (Table 1).  During this growth phase, day temperatures of 75-800  F (24-270 C) and night temperatures around 650 F (180 C)  are maintained. Medium temperature (recorded at 8 a.m.  daily) averages 680 F (200 C). Photoperiod is extended to  18 hours. At the end of week six, the medium is leached  with copious amounts of irrigation water to remove any  salt build-up prior to beginning the accelerated growth  phase. Also, during week six, seedling foliage is tested  for nutrient concentrations to detect any deficiencies. •  15  14  13  12  1 1  10  :l;  U 9  Z 8  ~ :z: 7  \J  ill 6 :z:  5  4  3  2  o 2 4  3.0  2.8  2 .6  2.4  2.2  2.0  :l;  :l; 1.8  Z 1.6  .""w."" 1.4 «~ 1 .2  U  1.0  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0 .0  0 2 4  Continued natural hardening  Moisture stress and bud initiation  Accelerated growth phase  Initial growth phase  6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30  WEEKS  Figure 2.

Weather conditions, particularly the amount of  sunshine, have a strong influence on initial growth of  seed lings. Weekly height and root collar diameter (cal i­per)  measurements are taken on ten predetermined  sample trees within each lot. If height growth is  occurring faster than our target growth curve, rates of  applied nitrogen are reduced by lowering the rate of .  applied calcium nitrate to around 12 ppm. Conversely, If  growth is behind targeted levels, rates of applied nitrogen  are increased by increasing the rate of applied calcium  nitrate up to 46 ppm.  During this phase, seedlings may show Fusarium root  rot symptoms, chlorotic needles that turn necrotic,  resulting in the seedling turning brown to red-brown and  dying. The seedling tip may also wilt into a shepherd's  crook. Infected seedlings and cells should be removed as  soon as evident.  Cutworms are another potential pest. These moth  larvae attack young seedlings before the stems become  woody and will eat any of the above-ground portion of  the seedling, often leaving only stumps. These larvae are  night feeders, hiding during the day beneath the grit  when small or under the trays or benches when large.  The larvae can be controlled either by hand removal or  by spraying with an insecticide such as Dursban® late in  the day or evening. Adult moths are attracted to the  greenhouse by the photoperiod lights. Inseel-proof  greenhouses will exclude the female moths (Sutherland  and Van Eerden 1980).

This  phase begins during the seventh week. Levels of  phosphorous and potassium are reduced and nitrogen  concentrations increased to promote shoot growth.  Peters Conifer Grower® (20-7-19) is the main  fertilizer, applied at 60 ppm N supplemented with  calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0-10) at 23 ppm N, micronutrients,  and phosphoric acid (Table 2). Nutrients are still applied  during the twice weekly irrigations. Photoperiod and  temperatures are the same as for the initial growth phase.  Seedling heights are compared to the target growth  curve, and if growth is exceeding the target rate, nitrogen  rates are reduced by decreasing the rate of calcium  nitrate to 12 ppm N. Conversely, if growth is lagging  behind the target level, calcium nitrate can be applied at  46 ppm N. The calcium nitrate rates are increased or  decreased depending on what the growth curves dictate.  Ponderosa pine grown under this regime, without  any stress, begin to set buds during week eleven. If  height growth is at the desired level, the medium is  leached with copious amounts of irrigation water during  week 12 to remove any sa lt build-up and excessive  fertilizer. The medium is then allowed to dry down until  it is just barely moist. If the seedlings are below target  height, calcium nitrate levels are increased and the leach  postponed until the target is met. Usually, ponderosa  pine growth does exceed our targeted height growth. F0-  liage is again tested for nutrient deficiencies at this time  to correct any shortages.  Table 2.

Bud Initiation and  Root Collar Diameter Growth  The objective of this phase is to withhold nutrients  and moisture, creating a stressed condition in the  seedlings so that height growth will cease, terminal buds  will develop, and root collar diameter will increase.  During this growth phase, the seed lings are removed  from the twice weekly irrigation/fertilization schedule.  Levels of applied nitrogen are reduced and phosphorous  and potassium levels increased to achieve the objective.  Seedlings are now irrigated only when medium has  become barely moist. Our greenhouse technicians daily  seled seed lings at random, remove the rootplug from the  cell, and visually examine and feel the medium for  dryness. Although quite subjedive, we feel this method  has some advantages. One advantage is that disease and  inseds can be surveyed at the same time, and, by  random selection, the seedlings that are seldom exam­ined  because of inaccessibility are also checked. By  inspeding the root plug, we also gain some insight as to  how the root system is developing.

Micronutrients and phosphoric acid are applied during  each irrigation, and the conifer finisher is applied every  other irrigation.  7  The extended photoperiod is discontinued. Day  temperatures are set for 60-700 F (16-210 C) and night  temperatures of 50-600 F (10-160 C). We maintain  medium temperatures between 62-68° F (17-20° C) with  these air temperature ranges.  Once the buds are well developed, generally by  week 20 to 24, (mid- to late September), calcium nitrate  can be applied at low levels (23 ppm N) during each  irrigation to green the trees (allow them to recover) from  their stressed status and to provide a source of necessary  calcium.

(46 ppm N) but only applied after good bud formation.  Cold-Hardiness Induction Phase  The objective of this phase is to physiologically  prepare the trees for freezing temperatures. We  accomplish this by subjecting the trees to ambient  temperatures, thus allowing normal cold-hardiness to de­velop.  The ponderosa pine may appear slightly chlorotic,  and some lots may begin to show a purplish color of  needles and stems as an indicator of carbohydrate  accumulation and the beginning of physiological changes  preparing the seed ling for winter.  Beginning around mid-October, we allow air  temperatures within the greenhouses to go to ambient  (Fig. 1). However, the minimum temperature allowed in  the greenhouses is 280 F (_20 C), and the root plug is not  allowed to remain frozen. Temperatures remain about  ambient until the seedlings are packed for cold storage  in January. From late October until the trees are put into  cold storage, irrigation is necessary only about once  every three to four weeks. During these irrigations,  accelerated growth phase fertilizer rates are applied.  These act as a nutrient reserve within the medium for  use by the tree when out-planted.  8  Extraction and Cold Storage  Seedlings are well watered before being removed  from their containers and wrapped with a Saran-like  plastic in bundles of 25. The stickiness of the plastic  keeps the bundle firmly packed, which maintains plug  integrity and prevents moisture loss. Bundles of trees for  public conservation sales are placed four to a poly bag  (100 seedlings total), which is sealed before going to  refrigerated storage. Bundles of trees for large  reforestation working agreements are placed into poly­lined  wax boxes, which are also sealed airtight before  placing in cold storage. The refrigerated storage is kept at  33-34 0 F (0.5 0 C), with relative humidity near 100  percent. Seedlings have been stored successfully in this  manner for 5 months without the need for irrigation.  Seedlings in cold storage are routinely inspected for  disease problems. The most serious disease is caused by  fungi of the genus Botrytis. The symptoms are webs of  gray to gray-brown mycelium growing through the tops of  the seed lings, especially in the center of bundles. Tan or  brown-watery stem lesions may also be present.  Preventative methods are the best way to control this  problem and include the following: (1) pull, wrap and  store only vigorous, disease-free seedlings; (2) store  seedlings for the shortest duration possible; (3) routinely  inspect a sample of each lot, especially lots containing  significant quantities of dead needles which can serve as  an initial food base for the pathogen; (4) ship seedlings  showing mold problems immediately, if possible  (Sutherland and Van Eerden 1980). Mold growth can also  be reduced by dropping the storage temperature for fully  hardened seedlings to below freezing.  Conclusion  This regime has been very successful. Requested  quantities of seedlings meeting strict physiological and  morphological requirements are achieved or exceeded  with a minimum oversow. Seedlings grown under this  regime average 15 em in height and 2.B to 3.2 mm in  caliper. First year outplanting survival on the University  of Idaho Experimental Forest has exceeded 93 percent  each of the past six years, and seedlings are 25 to 35 em  tall after one growing season. The bottlebrush effect, or  ""planting shock"" growth pattern, does not Occur even  under abnormally dry growing seasons. We feel the most  important aspect of any growing regime is continually  monitoring the seedling growth as the regime progresses.  Height and caliper measurements can then be used to  modify or change the regime as the growth of the  seedlings dictates during one growing season and  between growing seasons. The regime has been devel­oped  from six years of records on fertilizer applications  rates and the resultant seedling growth, and will certainly  be modified in the pursuit to high-quality ponderosa  pine seedlings.  9  Literature Cited  Harlow, W.M., E.S.

Art work: Lorraine Ashland  Production: Yvonne Carree  ~  Universityofldaho  Cooperative Extension System  Supported by RREAEcosystem Management Project  Implementing Ecosystem Management on NIPF Lands in the Pacific Northwest  .. , :  Evaluating Wildlife Habitat  for Managing Private Forest Ecosystems  in the Inland Northwest  Pamela Town and Ronald L.Mahoney  While many silvicultural plans are primarily  concerned with timber production, manipulation of  the forest through logging, prescribed burning,  grazing, or doing nothing can effect wildlife  habitat. Incorporating wildlife habitat management  into a silvicultural prescription can provide income  for the landowner, habitat for various wildlife  species, and increase the diversity of the forest.  Forests are complex and dynamic and can provide  diverse wildlife habitat if properly managed.  Landowners and managers must consider an array  of information to meet management objectives.  Holistic management plans may require the in­volvement  of a qualified natural resource profes­sional  who can correctly interpret forest and  wildlife habitat conditions and recommend a course  of action. Professionals can assess existing condi­tions  and assist in selecting forest management  practices which meet the landowner's objectives,  satisfy regulatory requirements, and assure biologi­cally  sound management, while considering land­scape-  level ecosystem impacts. The best land  management involves a partnership of the land­owner  with appropriate professional assistance.  An itemized unit and site evaluation form for  general si lvicultural prescriptions and ecosystem  management planning, including timber informa­tion,  is available from your local Extension Office  and is titled ""Evaluating Private Forest Ecosystems  for Silvicullllral Prescriptions alld Ecosystem  Managemelll Planning"" (FWR Station Bulletin No.  59). The attached itemized inventory form exam­ines  wildlife habitat within an area. It can be  completed in conjunction with or instead of Bulletin  No. 59. This form is intended to assure that  various wildlife habitat components are considered  when developing management plans, and to provide  a record of current habitat conditions.  Wildlife species are typically associated with  specific habitat components. Identification of these  habitat characteristics can provide important  information without the expense and difficulty of  gathering on-site wildlife population information.  Many habitat components, as they relate 10 animal  interactions, are considered important in wildlife  habitat management and landscape-level ecosystem  management planning. This inventory provides  baseline data on the types and extent of habitat the  property offers.  This itemized form is designed to be used by  wildlife biologists, foresters, and natural resources  professionals in the Inland Northwest, as well as by  others with knowledge of wildlife habitat, vegeta­tion,  and other land characteristics. A Pacific  Northwest publication titled ""Forest Stewardship  Planning Workbook -- All Ecosystem Approach to  Mallaging your Forestlane(' (PNW 490) has  recently been completed by Washington State  University and is available from Extension Offices  in the Pacific Northwest. This workbook, either  alone or offered with a forest stewardship planning  course, provides excellent background information  on ecosystem management for private landowners,  and explains how to incorporate this inventory in  management planning.  No specialized equipment is necessary to complete  this inventory as the components are evaluated by  visual observations. The completed field form  should become a permanent record, 10 be updated  periodically to assist in monitoring wildlife habitat  over time, determine if management Objectives are  being accomplished, and provide information to  future owners and managers.  Itemized Explanation of Unit Inventory  for Wildlife Habitat  NOTE: This section explains each step on the field form that follows. We recommend reading through  this section and the field form prior to use. The observer should use this section as a reference as needed.  Once the user is familiar with the form, they may not need this section. The field form is located at the  end of the publication to make it easier to photocopy for additional inventories.  1. Name of fi eld observer(s).  2. Date of evaluation.  3. Legal description of the property location, including landowner's name and meridian. (Example:  Town's property, Anywhere, Idaho - NW 1/4, SE 1/2, Sec 9 T4 1N R3W BM.)  4. Identify the boundaries of the unit to be inventoried; the unit may be based on total ownership or on a  stand-level. Interpretation will be simplified if the boundaries include a similar forest stand, land form,  or habitat type. Complex, large ownerships may require separate general and specific unit evaluations.  The following questions apply to the inventoried unit alld may be answered using aerial photography,  topographical maps, soil surveys, and/or vegetation classification systems, then verified in the fie ld.  5. Map names and numbers (include both aerial photos and topographical maps).  6. Size (identify in acres).  7. Elevation (include the minimum, maximum, and average elevation in feet).  8. Describe the locali zed landform in terms of landscape contour and percent slope.  9. Record the overall aspect of the slope (if variable indicate dominant aspects).  10. Record the dominant soil type(s) using USDA soil survey book. Identi fy the type of bedrock and surficial  deposits if present. Many Inland Northwest soils are underlain by granite or basalt for example, and  overl ain by loess or alluvial soils. Record the habitat type(s) using familiar vegetation classification  schemes. Be sure to fi eld verify and recognize significant areas of di ffe rence.  11. Record the type and condition of access to and within the inventoried unit. Also include the type of  access to and within the surrounding landscape (may include neighbors' property). Indicate the amount of  traffic on each type of road/trail (heavy, moderate, or light use).  12. Record the current dominant land uses of the inventoried unit and surrounding landscape (may include  neighbors' property).  13. Estimate the distance of the property to a water source and indicate whether it is a temporary or perma­nent  source. A temporary water source includes surface water that is temporarily available to wildlife  (vernal pools, intermittent streams) . A permanent water source includes any surface water which contin­ues  to be available to wildlife year- round (streams, lakes, ponds).  A. State the type of the water source and indicate whether it is protected or unprotected. If protected,  describe the type of protection (legal, fencing).  14. Estimate the distance of the inventoried unit to a di ffe rent vegetative structure(s) and identify the  structure(s). A different vegetative structure includes areas with a different plant community (ie:  species composition, successional stage, age/size class, residential areas, or agricultural lands) . ..  15. Sketch a location and physical features map of the inventoried unit and the surrounding landscape. Show  the scale and orientation of the map. Indicate landmarks and land uses such as roads, permanent water  sources, agricultural lands, cover types, or buildings.  16. Record the topographical position relative to local topography.  17. Estimate the air drainage conditions using topography as the main criteria.  18. Record evidence of past flres, including year(s) and ev idence (ie: charred boles).  19. Record the successional stage(s).  20. Record the forest canopy structure(s).  21. Estimate the average tree density.  22. Estimate the level of current and historic foraging (including grazing and browsing). Do not include  foraging in riparian zones. [Severe foraging includes soil di splacement and compaction, erosion of  heav ily used trail s, bare areas, browsed trees, and shrub browsing past the current year's growth through  a majority of the unit. Heavy foraging includes patchy distribution of severe foraging characteri stics, or  less deteriorating soil and vegetation conditions. Moderate foraging includes sites where the vegetation is  fully utilized with little apparent degradation. Light foraging occurs in sites infrequently utilized for a  short time (seasonally) with liule impact on soils or vegetation.] Indicate the animal species foraging.  Special Wildlife Habitat Components  NOll-riparian snags and cavity trees are trees with internal cavities  which are not within a riparian zone - these trees may be live cavity trees or dead snags.  NOTE: For simplicity, snags and cavity trees will be referred to as ""snags"" for the remainder of this  publication.  23. Estimate the number of existing snags. Record as the number of snags per acre.  24. Estimate the average diameter at breast height (dbh) of existing snags. If there is a range of diameters in  all three cl asses, record ""mixture of diameters"".  25. Estimate the average height of existing snags in feet. If there is a range of heights in all four classes,  record "" mixture of heights"".  26. Recruitment snags - Count the number of trees which have been designated as trees to be left as future  snags.  A. If no trees have been des ignated but some trees ""could be"", provide notes on poss ible recruitment  snags (ie: larch has mi stletoe, bark beetles, heart-rot).  NOll-riparian large organic debris are large logs (at least 12 inches ill diameter and 10 fee t long)  on the forest floor which are not within a riparian zone.  27. Estimate the number of large organic debris per acre on the forest floor.  Rack habitats include cliffs, talus slopes, rocky olllcrops, and caves.  28. Identify any rock habitats. Railroad tunnels and mines may be classified as caves.  A. If a rock habitat is present, describe its characteristics (ie: height of cliff, size of talus slope, cliff  with talus slope at the base, size of cave, and indicate whether it is natural or man-made).  29. Indicate the amount of human disturbance each rock habitat is subject to.  II  UNIVERSiTY IF HIW UHPJR7  Non-riparian vertical stratification is lhe layering of vegelaliol1  ill lhe foresl, excluding riparian areas.  30. Estimate the average thickness of the duff layer, in inches.  31. Estimate the ground vegetation density, distribution, and list the dominant species. Ground vegetation  includes all non-woody plants (ferns, forbs, grasses).  32. Estimate the shrub density, distribution, and list the dominant species. Shrub vegetation includes woody  shrubs and seedlings less than 5 feet tall.  33. Estimate the sub-canopy density, distribution, and list the dominant species. Sub-canopy includes tall  shrubs (ie: Rocky Mountain maple, alders), and tree saplings.  34. Estimate the percent canopy cover, distribution, and list the dominant species. Canopy cover includes the  overstory trees.  Riparian zones are lhe areas bordering bodies of waler wilh  moisl soils alld planls adapled 10 moisl cOl1diliollS.  35. Record the type of water occurring within the riparian zone.  36. Estimate the average width of the riparian zone. If the riparian zone vegetation is narrow, briefly de­scribe  (#36A) and skip to question #41. If the riparian zone vegetation is illlermediale or wide, go to  question #37. There is no set footage on narrow vs. wide, the field observer must decide the width which  impacts the resilience of wildlife habitat for the specific area.  37. Snags within the riparian zone. Estimate the number of existing snags per 1,000 linear feet of riparian  zone. For questions #378 - 37E see explanations #24 - 26.  F. Estimate the number of large organic debris per 1,000 linear feet, which are or could eventually fall  across the water channel. This will include standing live trees and snags which could fall across the  water channel.  38. Large organic debris within the riparian zone - see question #27 for explanation.  39. Foraging in riparian zone - see question #22 for explanation.  A. Describe foraging impacts on the water banks (ie: heavy erosion, lack of vegetation).  40. Vertical stratification within the riparian zone - see questions #30 - 34 for explanation.  Edges are crealed whell 2 differelll plalll communilies  or slruclural lypes come logelher.  41. Describe the type of the edge. Illherelll edges occur naturally [through abrupt soil type changes, topo­graphical  differences, or changes in microclimate (ie: wet meadow vs. forest, north vs. south slopes)],  whereas induced edges are created through various land use practices (ie: clearcut vs. dense forest).  A. An abrupl and nOlTOW edge is when I vegetation type abruptly turns into the adjacent vegetation  type with a narrow transition zone (ecotone). A gradual and wide edge is when the plant communi­ties  are broken into patterns of vegetation islands and peninsulas, usually providing a more diverse  plant structure, and wider ecotone.  42. Record the 2 different plant communities along the edge (ie: meadow and forest) and contrast  between them. A high COl1lraSl edge occurs when 2 very different plant communities come together  (ie: a clearing and mature fo rest). A low COlllrast edge occurs when the plant communities are similar,  yet an edge is formed (ie: pole/sapling and mature forest) .  z::;o •  43. If an opening has created the edge, describe the shape of the opening, the vegetative type within the  opening, and the average distance from the center of the opening to the edge.  Interior forests are tracts of cOlI/illi/oi/sly forested areas.  * * Interior forests are generally at least 330 feet from all opening * *  44. Estimate the distance of the interior forest from the nearest opening. This may measure outside your  inventoried unit.  A. Indicate whether the opening(s) are natural (ie: root-rot pocket) or human-induced (ie: 5 acres  logged).  45. Record the size of the interior forest. This may include land outside your inventoried unit or ownership.  46. Estimate the distance of this interior forest to another interior forest.  Summary  47. List any special habitat or unique features found within the inventoried unit (ie: heron rookeries, elk  wintering grounds, pileated woodpecker nests, beaver ponds, aspen stand).  48. List any threatened and endangered species, or species of special concern within the inventoried unit.  49. Record the wildlife species and wildlife signs observed in the inventoried unit. Estimate the amount of  use (ie: indicate presence of tracks, heavy browse, worn game trails, nests, gopher mounds, owl pellets).  50. List the wildlife species which could benefit from the existing habitat. These species may not be utilizing  the area, but could.  51. List the wildlife species the landowner would like to manage for.  52. Sketch a map of the inventoried unit and verbally describe. This map should be a larger scale of the  inventoried unit than the map in question 15. Include the location of rock habitats, riparian zones,  openings, and limiting factors to active management (ie: no roads, high water table). Show the  scale and orientation of the map.  53. List any additional habitat/unit evaluation which should be reviewed by a specialist (ie: soils, water,  silviculture, protected species, range, forest engineers, etc) and state why such an evaluation is needed.  54. Include any notes and comments (including possible management improvements) which could be com­pleted  on the unit. Use additional paper if necessary.

Mahoney  The purpose of this survey is to assist landowners in  evaluating and recording important information about  the condition of streams flowing through their for­ested  property. Although the Idaho Forest Practices  Act has specific regulations regarding logging opera­tions  adjacent to streams, other potential land use  disturbances (e.g., recreation, grazing, agriculture)  are not governed by regulations that legally protect  the stream.  Landowners' objectives may vary their perspective on  stream health. While one landowner may define a  healthy stream as one possessing pristine conditions  with no disturbances, another may define a healthy  stream as one possessing a lot of riparian (the area  between the stream and upland) vegetation, clean  water, numerous fish, and access to the stream bank.  In general, a forested stream containing no chemical  pollution, and having stable banks, low sedimentation,  and flowing, shaded water provides ""healthy"" water  conditions which may be able to support aquatic life.  This inventory is designed to record existing stream  conditions, identify areas of special concern, and  serve as basis for recognizing changes in stream and  riparian areas. This information gathering process is  the first step in developing a riparian management  plan. The process is designed to assist landowners in  identifying current or potential problem areas while  providing a record of existing stream conditions.  Often the evaluation of stream quality is part of a  larger examination of forest land conditions in prepa­ration  for development of a forest management plan or  as a prelude to timber harvest or other activity.  Two companion publications that can help complete a  forest examination are Evaluating Private Forest  Ecosystems for Silvicultural Prescriptions and Ecosys­tem  Management Planning (FWR Station Bulletin No.  59) and Evaluating Wildlife Habitat for Managing  Private Forest Ecosystems in the Illland Northwest  (FWR Station Bulletin No. 60). Both publications can  be obtained by contacting your local Extension office.  Landowners may want to seek professional assistance  if they feel their forest stream is unhealthy. Idaho is  3  I  fortunate enough to possess a Stream walk Program,  where stream information can be analyzed and com­bined  with larger watershed (a landscape draining into  a single stream) data. Landowners interested in this  watershed management program should contact the  Idaho Water Resources Research Institute at the  University of Idaho, 106 Morrill Hall, Moscow, ID  83844, (208) 885-6429. If your stream quality survey  shows chemical contamination or other problems  requiring regulatory assistance, contact your regional  office of the Department of Environmental Quality  (DEQ) or the state DEQ office in Boise.  The best time of the year to monitor a stream is late  July or early August. Spring runoff has been com­pleted  and problem areas, such as eroding banks and  siltation are most visible. Surveys of the same moni­tored  area should be completed at approximately the  same time each year for consistency in observing any  changes. Special attention should be given to riparian  areas after a major disturbance occurs within the  watershed. Major disturbances include: development,  agricultural land expansion, logging, mud slides,  increased grazing, increased access and recreation,  road construction, wildfire, or periods of heavy  rainfall/snowfall.  We recommend that you designate at least one perma­nent  (easy to find in consecutive years) plot along  your stream. A plot is a specific point in the stream  which provides an average representation of your  stream. Most streams have enough variability that at  least two or three plots will be required to adequately  represent stream conditions. Plots should be perma­nent  so the same exact area can be examined each  year, showing changes over time.  An itemized evaluation guide is attached. The numeri­cal  instructions will assist you in filling out the field  form. Throughout the instructions, there are ""red­flag""  potential problem areas and suggestions of  possible solutions you should consider, and discuss,  with any professionals working with you.  The materials required to complete this survey are a  pencil, shallow pan (white bottom is best), thermom-  eter, and measuring tape. Other helpful materials  include a yard stick (to measure depth), waders or  shoes that can get wet (placing felt on the sales will  assist in traction), kick-net (to capture and record  aquatic invertebrates - see Figures 4 and 5), plant  identification book, and polarized glasses. When  surveying your stream, remember that wet rocks are  slippery, logs may roll, and currents may be faster  than they appear so consider safety first. It is always  a good idea to have a partner on shore as a minimum  safety practice.  6 xplanation of Foee sted Steea' 6val ... \C\tion Field Foe'  NOTE: This section explains each step on the field form and provides additional comments to ""red flag""  potential problem areas and offer management solutions. We recommend reading through this section  and the field form prior to use. The field form is located at the end of the publication to make it easier to  photocopy for additional surveys.  1. Name(s) of actual field observer(s).  2. Date(s) the stream is monitored.  3. Describe the stream location, including landowner's name(s), stream name, and general location of the  stream.  4. Directions to the portion of the stream monitored. You should be able to locate the site again (use  property boundaries, confluence, landmarks). There is no magic number of how much of the stream  you should survey. More information helps determine changes in the stream over time and better  evaluates the range of varying conditions in any single stream. A photo taken from the same point each  year is helpful for location and evaluation.  5. Record and compare the overall average and actual annual precipitation rate from local sources (e.g.,  weather station, radio station, Extension office, other agencies).  Dry is when the annual precipitation is below average for the year throughout all seasons. A verage is  when the annual precipitation is average for the year throughout all seasons. Wet is when the annual  precipitation is above average for the year throughout all seasons. Seasonal is when the annual precipi­tation  may be above average in the winter and below average in the summer. Indicate which season  possessed each precipitation rate (winter-dry, summer-wet, spring and fall-average).  6. Record the stream class: Class I streams are used for domestic water supply or are impor.tant for the  spawning, rearing, or migration of fish . Class II streams are usually small streams that drain into Class  I streams, and are used by only a few, if any, fish for spawning or rearing.  7. Record the current dominant land uses surrounding the monitored stream. Record the current dominant  land uses surrounding the stream and on the property upstream from the monitored stream segment.  The following measurements should be taken at three or more locations along the  monitored stream and an average calculated  8. A. Water temperature: Place a thermometer in a shaded pool, firmly tied in place for about one hour  before recording the temperature. For best results, record temperatures at three or more stream  locations, at different daily time intervals, and on various days throughout the summer.  4  B. After all water temperatures have been recorded, check appropriate box(es). These are general  temperature estimates for potential fisheries:  i. Temperature fluctuations are too extreme, decreasing available dissolved oxygen  (oxygen needed for life). Shading is needed.  ii. Water at these temperatures is ""good"" for supporting salmon ids (trout, salmon).  iii. Water at these temperatures is ""fair"" for supporting salmonids.  iv. Water at these temperatures can support warm water fishes (bass, carp, catfish).  v. Water temperatures are too high to support fish, shading is needed.  9. Indicate the water colors present, after walking along the stream looking for color changes.  i. Clear indicates good water quality.  ii. Reddish may be caused by natural tannins (from tree bark and needles or leaves),  which indicates fairly good water quality l![ may be from blood or oil spills further  upstream, which indicates ""poorer"" water quality.  iii. Greenish may indicate excessive algae growth caused by excessive nutrients upstream  (e.g., fertilizers from agricultural crops); poor water quality.  iv. Brownish or yellowish color indicates erosion or heavy sedimentation problem; poor  water qUality.  v. Iridescent sheen on top of the water may indicate rotting vegetation, oil based pesti­cides,  or leaked and/or dumped oil; poor water quality.  10. Stream bed substrate: At three or more riffles (areas where surface water is agitated - Figure I)  of the monitored stream, record the overall percent of each stream bed substrate, with 100% total  amount of substrate present. Substrate will help you monitor sedimentation levels, which impact  aquatic plants. fish and amphibians.  Figure I. Stream Characteristics Defined  Pool  i. Silt/clay/mud--fine particles. Very small spaces between particles hold a lot of water,  making an ooze-like sediment. Poor fish spawning habitat.  ii. Sando-tiny rock particles up to .1 inch. Poor fish spawning habitat.  iii. Gravel--stones from tiny 1/4 inch pebbles to 2 inches. Best fish spawning substrate.  iv. Cobbles--rocks 2 inches to 10 inches large.  v. Boulders--rocks more than 10 inches large.  vi. Bedrock--solid rock bottom.  Cobbles. boulders, and bedrock are beneficial to fish habitat as long as substalllial gravel  areas are preselll for spawning.  5  11. Embeddedness: Estimate the percent of the larger substrates (cobble or boulders) which are embedded  (buried) by smaller substrates and particles. Zero to 25% occurs when most of the substrate is visible  and not buried by smaller particles (sand). Greater than 76% occurs when the larger substrate is almost  completely buried by the smaller particles. A stream with a high percentage of embeddedness provides  poor fish spawning habitat and lacks cover for fish , amphibians, and aquatic insects.  12. Record the presence of fish and identify the species, if possible. Troutlsalmon are intolerant to pollu­tion  and high water temperatures. Bass are somewhat tolerant of pollution and high water tempera­tures.  Suckers or carp are tolerant of higher levels of pollution and higher water temperatures.  Lack of fish. If an intermittent stream is being monitored, the lack of fish may not be a major concern.  If water flows year round, the lack of fish may indicate a water quality problem (such as extreme  temperatures or lack of oxygen). Some year round streams may serve as a travel corridor for migrating  fish, possessing fish only in the spring and fall.  Ripa .. ia"", A .. ea  Continue to take measurements along the monitored stream  to determine the overall condition of the riparian area  The riparian area is the area between the stream and upland system. Riparian areas possess moist soils and (if  present) plants adapted to moist conditions (examples: wi llows, alders, devil's club, oak fern, bluejoint  reedgrass). The riparian area may range in width from just a few feet (near steep banks of streams) to hundreds  of feet (along lowland streams and rivers).  13. Record whether roads exist within the riparian zone. If roads are present, indicate the amount of  use (heavy, moderate, or light use).  14. A. Record the total amount of shading over the stream channel and indicate if the shading is consistent  or patchy. Small shallow streams have higher temperature fluctuations; therefore, require more  dense and consistent shading for aquatic life. Shading is a subjective judgement affected by many  factors including time of day, topographic position, and orientation. Noon to afternoon shading is  usually the most critical.  B. Record the dominant component that shades the stream. Trees and tall shrubs are the best vegeta­tion  10 shade the stream as they shade more area; provide bank stability (through an extensive root  system); provide food and cover for insects, fish , amphibians, and other wildlife; and can create  small dams when they fall into the water, increasing the number of pools.  15. Record the observed amount of stream side erosion and indicate if the erosion is consistent or patchy.  Identify the cause of erosion, if known (animal grazing, floods, ATV crossing). Extra space is avail­able  to describe areas of special concern.  If little or no shading occurs or the stream banks are eroding, there are a few options. Crasses can be  planted to assist with streamside erosion; however, grasses provide little shading. Tall shrubs or trees  can be planted to provide both bank stability and shading. Planting grasses and trees (grasses provide  some stability as trees become established) often leads 10 high maintenance. If left untreated, grasses  can ou/compete the tree seedlings for light, nutrients, and water, reducing the success rate of  establishing trees. Successful tree establishment may require herbicides, mowing, or grazing to reduce  vegetative competition. Domestic or wildlife grazing may require tree shelters or other measures to  protect tree seedlings.  Bank erosion can further be reduced by preventing or managing domestic animal grazing through  seasonal rotation or fencing, constructing bridges or rock fords at areas prone to heavy footlAIT  traffic, or using very large rocks (ripraps - a very expensive method to increase bank stability).  6  16. A. Indicate the average width of the riparian area, in feet. Measure the distance from the high water  mark to the outer edge of riparian area (see Figure 2 for pictures on determining the high water  mark/stream width). To find the outer edge of the riparian zone, look for a change in vegetation to  more upland, drier-site plants and drier soils.  B. Briefly describe the condition of the riparian area to complement the stream condition information  already recorded. [e.g., The riparian area was heavily logged 30 years ago; however, trees are now  abundant. There are a few areas where past floods have deposited fine particles (needles, small  branches, sand). Ground vegetation is sparse, consisting of a few ferns.] Riparian areas can be  extremely biologically productive and diverse due to the water availability to plants and animals.  Narrow, less productive riparian areas are common where topography is steep or streams are very  small. The width of the riparian area can change naturally or artificially, and these changes can  indicate significant alteration of stream quality.  Pe~ma"" e ""t Plot  Permanent plots are valuable because the same exact area can be examined in consecutive years, showing  changes over time. Changes may be due to weather, upstream land use, or normal stream evolution. Other  parts of this survey will help determine impacts of changes and indicate potential for improvement or stabiliza­tion.  Whether you choose one or several permanent plots, make sure they can be located in subsequent years.  Permanent plots (or points) should be established in a riffle (see Figure I for pictures derming riffles).  17. Describe the exact location of the plot(s).  18. Record the stream channel information (see Figure 2):  Wetted width: width of actual water in the stream at the time of measurement.  Stream wjdth: width of stream at high water mark. Stream width can be identified by the scour­ing  of rocks or vegetation created during periods of high water flow, gravel deposits, or a sharp  leveling of the bank.

Stream cross-sectional shape: Imagine your stream abruptly ended: What would the stream channel  look like (check appropriate figure)? Stream channels are always changing and moving as a natural  process. Material is deposited on one side of the channel, while the other side is eroded (see Figure 3).  Stream erosion also occurs latill/dinally, meaning the flowing water continues to cut (erode) the stream  bed. These are natural processes occurring over many years; however, they can be altered by poor  riparian management. Streams which become wider and shallower or more braided are subject to  higher water temperatures, less available dissolved oxygen,fewer pools (holding tanks) for fish and  amphibians, and often possess an increase in sedimentation and bankside erosion.

Aquatic invertebrate inventory: to measure aquatic invertebrates, collect and record which species  are present in the permanent plot.  The best method to collect and identify aquatic invertebrates is to use a thin-mesh net or kick net  (Figure 4) placed about an arms-length downstream from you. Hold the net stationary and flat on the  stream bottom, with the top angled downstream, away from you. Move toward the net kicking through  the stream substrate (Figure 5). The net should trap particles yet allow water to flow through. Once  you reach the net, use a scooping, upstream motion to bring the screen above the water surface. Place  contents of the net in a shallow, white-bottom pan with a little water. Sifting through the contents will  produce a variety of stream organisms to identify. Use letter codes (A = 1-9, B = 10-99, C = &gt;100)  to record the numbers of organisms found in each of the 12 boxes on the aquatic invertebrate inventory  form on page 13. Then add the number of boxes with a letter in each column and multiply by the  indicated index value. The columns are divided based on the organism's sensitivity to pollution. Add  the three index values for a total score. In addition to a total score greater than 12, a variety of aquatic  invertebrates is ""healthier"" than numerous individuals of the same species. Retum contents to the  stream when examination is complete. You should collect at least three samples per plot.  Figure 4. Kick Net Figure 5.

LEE AND LEONARD R. JOHNSON  INTRODUCTION  Recently, we have seen a variety of terms used to  describe a changing and evolving philosophy  toward forest management. We have heard of  concepts called new forestry, adaptive forestry,  environmental forestry, and ecosystem manage­ment.  Although there are differences in how forest  management is viewed in each of these concepts,  the impact on the cost of vegetative manipulation  and timber removal will be similar. All of these  forest management concepts put a greater emphasis  on partial cutting, are likely to result in harvesting  a larger portion of trees from the smaller diameter  classes and, in some cases, stress a reduction in the  road density used to access the site. These factors  generally translate into higher timber removal  costs.  Estimating the cost of timber harvesting can he  difficult because of the large number of factors  affecting harvesting costs. When silvicultural  prescriptions and methods of timber removal  change significantly from those normally encoun­tered,  cost estimation can be even more difficult.  This publication can be used to develop cost  estimates for timber harvesting under the stand  conditions and silvicultural prescriptions likely to  be found when applying principles of ecosystem  management. The cost estimation process can also  be used to determine the impact on logging costs of  alternative silvicultural prescriptions. Costs are  developed in dollars per unit of output, in this case  a thousand board feet of timber (MBF) and are  based on actual 1995 cost data for equipment and  labor.  The cost analysis uses a basic cost calculation to  determine the cost per MBF to fell, buck, skid,  load and haul the timber. The basic costs are a  function of the hourly cost of the equipment, the  size of the removed trees, pieces moved or pro­cessed  per productive cycle, and the average cycle  time. Each cost component is modified by factors  related to the density of the timber stand, the  3  percent of trees removed, steepness of the site, and  skidding and hauling distances. Costs of each of the  revised components are then summed to provide an  estimate of the total logging cost. Costs to prepare  the site for logging, to move equipment to the site,  to pile slash and close trails after operations, and  an allowance for overhead and profit of the owner  of the logging firm are added to these costs. The  user is guided through this process through a series  of tables compiled in Appendix A. Example calcu­lations  describe the process in detail.  A large array of equipment is available to perform  the specific tasks of timber harvesting. The data  shown here represent the most common types of  equipment in this region and allows the user to  select from among a limited choice of common  equipment options.  As the size and cost of the equipment increases,  such as that used in mechanized harvesting opera­tions,  the size of the harvest unit becomes more  important. The cost to move the equipment to the  logging site is a fixed cost and must be offset by a  sufficient size area and sufficient volume for  removal. Small units (20 acres and less) can  generally not justify use of mechanized systems  unless they are close to an area that is also utilizing  the same mechanized system. Conventional systems  using chainsaws to fell and buck are generally more  mobile than the mechanized systems and can be  moved to a site for less cost.  I BASE ASSUMPTIONS FOR AVERAGE COSTS I  The initial cost calculation for each of the tasks of  harvesting represents an estimate for an average  stand and typical harvest prescription. Volumes are  expressed in gross MBF, the common practice in  the region since that is the basis for paying the  logger. The mill, however, will pay for the wood  (after making a deduction for defect) on the net  hoard feet delivered. Harvesting timher with high  defect will result in less revenue, but the same  logging costs, as harvesting timber with low defect.  , ,  The average conditions assumed for the base costs  shown here include the following:  Volume/ Acre:  Removed Volume/Acre:  Percent Defect:  Initial Density of Trees  5000 - 8000 Gross  BF/Acre  2400 - 3200 Gross  BF/Acre  10%  (Down to 4 Feet in Height): 350 Trees/ Acre  Merchantable tree density: 200 Trees/Acre  Final Tree Density: 300 Trees/Acre  Percent Tree Removal: 25% of Merchantable  Percent Volume Removed: 40% of Merchantable  Range of Piece Diameter: 8 to 16 Inches  Average Piece Diameter:  Average Merchantable  Tree Length:  A verage Log Length:  Average Skid Distance:  10 Inches  65 Feet  28 Feet  500 Feet  Percent Slope for Skidding: 5 % Favorable  Pieces/Skidding Cycle: 6  The average logging cost calculated in the base  calculation reflects these conditions. Variance from  these conditions can be accounted for through a set  of cost modifiers provided in the accompanying  tables. These modifiers adjust costs for differences  in skid distance, slope, density of trees, percent of  trees removed, percent defect of the trees, and  piece size. The costs do not reflect additional time  and cost that might be required to work safely  around snags or other bazards or the additional cost  required to achieve some specific aesthetic goal of  the landowner.  OVERVIEW OF EQUIPMENT  The tables for felling and skidding include the most  common equipment used in tbe region to barvest  timber. This includes manual felling and bucking,  two types of mechanized feller-bunchers, two types  of mechanized delimber-processors (mecbanized  bucking), skidders and crawlers in two size classes,  a cut-to-Iength forwarder, a small and medium­sized  cable yarder for operations on steeper slopes,  4  a conventional hydraulic loader and conventional  log trucks. Costs are included for new and used  equipment in the skidder and crawler classifications  since many loggers utilize functional used equip­ment  for skidding to reduce their investment in  equipment.  Felling and skidding equipment is most often used  in some common combinations. Manual felling and  bucking is generally combined with a skidder or  crawler on gentle terrain (slopes less than 35-40%).  The crawler is often selected rather than the  skidder where skidding distances are relatively  short or where slopes are steeper (25 % and  higher) . Many small-scale loggers, however, will  utilize a small crawler as their single skidding  vehicle because of its versatility and its ability to  maneuver in the limited areas common when  thinning stands. This capability allows the small  crawler to work effectively in small woodlots.  Material will normally be skidded tree length to a  landing and bucked to log lengths at that location.  Consideration of the damage that might be caused  to the residual stand by movement of tree length  material may cause the landowner to require log­length  logging. In this case, material is felled,  limbed and bucked in the woods, and logs, rather  than entire trees, are skidded to the landing. Log  length skidding is more costly than with tree length  logging because more pieces are handled in the  skidding operation. Newer equipment such as the  cut-to-Iength forwarder might be combined with a  log length felling and bucking operation where  skidding distances are long and the logs are  prebunched to a skid trail for the forwarder. The  forwarder is an expensive machine, however, and  would probably have to work with several small  operations to make this pay. Even this approach  may not be feasible because of problems associated  with working with several different landowners and  the work involved in moving the forwarder.  When slopes exceed 35 to 40 percent, cable yarders  will usually be used to move material to the land­ing.  This operation is called yarding rather than  skidding. Two size classes of cable yarders are  shown in tbe equipment table. The small size is  most appropriate for average tree diameters of 12  to 15 incbes, but with proper technique can still be  used to move larger logs . The medium-sized yarder  would normally be used when a significant number  of logs are larger than 15 inches in tree diameter.  •  Cable yarding operations are usually done with log  length material to facilitate handling and decking at  limited landings areas. In these cases, felled trees  are limbed and bucked in the woods.  Mechanization of one step of a logging operation  usually requires mechanization of all steps. A  feller-buncher in the felling function would be  linked to a skidder or crawler with a grapple. The  grapple is needed on the skidding vehicle to ,effec­tively  handle the bunches produced by the feller­buncher  and to keep up with the production of the  feller-buncher. Mechanization would also be  needed in the processing step of the operation;  usually, some type of mechanized limbing and  bucking equipment would be operating at the  landing.  BASIC COST CALCULATION  The accompanying tables in Appendix A are  organized in the order they would be used to  develop harvesting costs.  The basic cost calculation shown in Table 5 consid­ers  the hourly cost of the equipment, the hours  required per productive cycle under the average  conditions noted above, the pieces that can be  processed per cycle and the average volume per  piece. Hourly costs, average hours per cycle and  pieces per cycle are obtained from Tables 2 and 3  for felling, bucking, and skidding equipment.  Average piece size comes from the average condi­tions  of the stand being harvested, and can be  calculated as shown in Table 1 from the number of  harvested trees per acre, the harvested volume per  acre, the average tree length, and average log  length. Many modern computer programs can  provide estimates of the required information from  common timber inventory (cruise) data.  Costs related to moving equipment, preparing the  site, performing follow-up activities after logging  and owner profit and overhead are added to these  basic logging costs to develop a total cost estimate  for logging.  EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS  Calculation of basic harvesting costs and use of the  information provided in the tables can best be  illustrated through example calculations. Three are  provided here.  5  Example 1: Conventional Logging  Suppose you are removing 50 of the 350 trees per  acre on your 40 acre woodlot. The removed  volume will average 2,400 board feet per acre.  Trees have low defect, average \0 inches in diam­eter,  and average 50 feet in merchantable height.  The preferred log length is 33 feet. The average  log length will be something less than the 33 foot  log. Shorter logs are cut to make a specific log  product, because of defect or form problems, or to  utilize logs from the top of the tree. Ground slopes  are fairly gentle and average 5 % down to the  landing. Your average skid distance is 600 feet.  Because of the gentle slopes and low intensity of  removal, you elect to use manual felling with a  chainsaw and tree length skidding with a small,  new wheeled skidder. Bucking will take place at  the landing. You are located 50 miles from the  mill.  Using the formulas of Table I, you calculate your  average piece size and the number of logs 'per tree  as follows:  LogsfTree = Average Merchanlable Tree Length = ~ = 1.52 Logsl  Preferred Log Length 33 Tree  Rounded  to 2  Logsffree  MBFrrree - Removed MRP/Acre - 2,400 = 48 BF = .048 MBFrrrce  Removed Trees/Acre 50 (free  MBF/Log ~ 48 BFffree ~ 24 BF/Log ~ .024 MBF/Log  2 Logsffree  Talal Volume Harvested = [2.400 BF·40 AcresJI.&lt;X&gt;O = 96 MBF L Acre  The next step determines hourly cost and production  for felling , skidding and bucking. Using Tables 2 and  3, we find hourly costs, product and pieces per cycle  for our selected equipment.  Hourly Cost Hours/Cycle Pieces/Cycle  Felling  Bucking  Skidding  25.87  25.87  49.06  • Number of logs per tree  .05  .04  .20  •• Interpretation between load size for 8"" and  12"" material  I  25 •••  Note that the feller and bucker produce one tree per  cycle. For the bucker, this represents a cycle size  equal to the number of logs per tree. Felling,  bucking and skidding costs can now be calculated  using the formula from Table 5.  Base Felling Cost = (25 .87) (,05) = $26.95/MBF  (I) (.048)  Base Bucking Cost = (25.87) (,04) = $21.56/MBF  (2) (.024)  Base Skidding Cost = (49.06) (,20) = $40.88/MBF  (5) (.048)  Felling costs are now modified by factors in Table  6. With an original density of 350 trees per acre  and a 14% tree removal, the adjustment to felling  costs, Tree Density for Felling (TOF), will be  1.095*' Final felling costs, therefore, will be:  $26.95 x 1.095 = $29.511MBF  , Use adjustment factor for 25 % removal and average  300 and 400 trees.  Skidding costs are modified by the factors in Table  7. With a removal level of 50 trees per acre, the  tree density factor (TO) is 1.37 (factor for 50 trees  per acre). At an average skid distance (SO) of 600  feet, the modifier for distance is 1.14 (half the  difference between 500 feet and 700 feet). With a  5% favorable slope, the modifier for slope (S) is  1.0. The final skidding costs is:  $40.88(TD)(SD)(S) = $/MBF  $40.88(1.37)(1 . 14)(1 .0) = $63.85/MBF  With the relatively small size of the recovered  material, load size will average 3500 board feet per  load with a cost of $12.74 per MBF (average of 8""  and 12"" material)*. Hauling costs are calculated on  the basis of a 50 mile haul. .  Calculating the hauling cost from the cost formula:  Haul Cost = $550/Day  [3 Loads/Day] [3.5 MBF/Load]""  Haul Cost = $52.38/MBF  • Calculated as the average cost for 8"" and 12"" material ((I6 .S9 +  8.89)121 - TABLE 8  ++ Calculated as the average of loads for 8"" and 12"" material [(3000  + 4000)/21 - TABLE 8  Total cost can now be determined by summing  these component costs, as is outlined in Table 10.  Felling  Bucking  Skidding  Loading  Hauling  Logging Cost  $ 29.511MBF  $ 21.56/MBF  $ 63.85/MBF  $ 12.74/MBF  $ 52.38/MBF  $180.04IMBF  6  The costs for moving in and out, site management  before and after harvest, and operational overhead  now need to be added to this total.  Cost for moving a conventional system the 50 miles  from the mill is moving cost divided by sale  volume:  Move In/Out = $550 = $5.73/MBF  96MBF  Costs of site management and overhead are based  on a percentage of the logging cost. Site manage­ment  includes a cost allowance for slash disposal,  seeding skid trails and landings, constructing water  bars, etc. The allowance for overhead includes such  things as profit for the owner of the logging  equipment, costs of supervision and management,  etc. :  Site Management = (.08)($180.04) = $14.40/MBF  Overhead = (.07)($180.04) = $12.60/MBF  So total costs to harvest this site are estimated at:  Logging Cost:  Move In/Out:  Site Management:  Overhead:  Total Cost Estimate  $180.04/MBF  $ 5.73/MBF  $ 14.40/MBF  $ 12.60/MBF  $212.77/MBF  Example 2: Mechanized Harvesting  Suppose you want to consider harvest of the stand  described in Example I with a mechanized harvest­ing  system. You would follow the same process as  before, but this time we will select equipment from  the mechanized options - a frame mounted feller­buncher,  a CTR type mechanized processor and a  new grapple skidder. Relevant data on hourly costs  and production are as follows:  Hourly Costs Hour/Cycle Pieces/Cycle  Felling: 75.94 .025 . 1  Bucking: 29.80 .012 2'  Skidding: 61.23 .140 5""  , Number of logsltree.

Cost to move the mechanized system is calculated  from information in Table 10 as:  Move In/Out = $1.040 = $1O.83/MBF  96MBF  Site Management = (.08)($171.67) = $13 .73 /MBF  Overhead = (.07)($171.67) = $12.02/MBF  Total cost is now calculated as:  Logging Cost  Move In/Out  Site Management  Overhead  Total Cost  $ 171.67/MBF  $ 10.83/MBF  $ 13.73/MBF  $ 12.02/MBF  $ 208.25/MBF  The mechanical operation appears to cost. slightly  less than the conventional logging system. One  should remember that production levels are higher  with the mechanical system, therefore, greater  difficulty may be experienced in keeping the  machines busy.  7  Example 3: Cable Yarding Operation  Consider another case where the trees are larger,  but the area is located with slopes steep enough to  require a cable yarding operation. You plan to  remove 50 of the 200 merchantable trees per acre  on the 40 acre site. This represents an estimated  removed volume of 10,000 board feet per acre.  Trees average 15 inches in diameter and 60 feet in  merchantable height. The preferred log length is 33  feet with an average of 28 feet. Average yarding  distance is 750 feet. We will use a medium skyline  system. This site is located 25 miles from the mill.  First, calculate volume per piece and logs per tree:  LogslTree = 60 = 1.82 LogslTree  33 Round to 2 LogslTree  MBFlTree = 10 MBF/Acre = .20 MBFlTree  50 Treesl Acre  MBF/Log = .20 MBFlTree = .10 MBF/Log  2 LogslTree  MBF = [10.000 BF * 40 acres] I 1,000 = 400 MBF  L acre  Since this is a cable yarding operation, we will  buck in the woods. Base cost and production are as  follows :  Hourly Cost Hour/Cycle Pieces/Cycie  Fell /Buck  Skidding  25.87  141.47  .12  .23*  * Use production for 800 feet distance.  Base costs are calculated as:  I  5  Felling: ($25.87)(.12) = $15 .52/MBF  (1)(.20)  Skidding: ($141.47)(.23) = $68.08/MBF  (5)(.10)  These costs are modified by the factors in Tables 6  and 7. The felling operation removes 25 % (50  trees) of 200 trees per acre and has an adjustment  factor of I, so the felling cost will stay at its  calculated base costs.  Skidding (yarding) costs are adjusted only for  removed tree density. A removal density of 50  trees per acre translates to an adjustment factor of  1.37, yielding an adjusted skidding cost of:  ($68.08 /MBF)(1.37) = $93.27 /MBF  Trees in this size class will result in load sizes of  5000 board feet (Table 8), with a cost of $5.69/  MBF for loading and a loading time of .36 hours.  Hauling costs for a 25 mile haul can then be  calculated as:  Haul Cost = $5501Day  I 5 LoadslDay] I 5 MBF/Loadl  Haul Cost = $22.00/MBF  Total logging costs are then:  Felling/Bucking  Skidding (Yarding)  Loading  Hauling  Logging COSt  $ 15.52/MBF  $ 93.27/MBF  $ 5.69/MBF  $ 22.00/MBF  $136.48/MBF  Costs to move equipment. for site management and  for overhead are calculated as:  Move In/Out = $455 = $1.14/MBF*  400 MBF  • Costs for 20 and 30 mile move divided by 2.  Site Managemem = (.08)($136.48) = $IO.92/MBF  Overhead = (.07)($136.48) = $ 9.55/MBF  Total costs can now be calculated as:  Logging COSI  Move In/Oul  Sile Managemem  Overhead  TOlal Cost  $136.48/MBF  $ 1.14/MBF  $ 10.92/MBF  $ 9.55/MBF  $158.09/MBF  8  ApPENDIX A - TABLES  TABLE I .

''-.  I·  Contracting for Timber Harvest  UnderEcosystem Management  Harry W. Lee and Leonard R. Johnson  Introduction  Many agreements to harvest timber from private  woodland are consumated with a simple handshake. In  many cases this is ample, but in the complex cases of  ecosystem management a written contract will usually  be far better. The written contract establishes commu­nication  and helps clarify the responsibi lities of all  parties involved. All participants will benefit from a  clear understanding of the scope of the project being  undertaken.  For the beginner, preparing a contract may seem  overwhelming and difficult. However, with a bit of  help, the task of writing an acceptable agreement can  be done with ease and wi ll satisfy the needs of all  parties.  Several local sources of sample contracts are avai lable  to nearly all landowners. These sources include the  local Idaho Department of Lands Office, timber  companies, Soil and Water Conservation Districts, the  Natural Resources Conservation Service Office, or  your local University of Idaho Extension Office. The  sample contracts should not be used in their entirety  but you can pick and choose provisions to develop a  document which best fits your situation. You should  keep in mind that more restrictions sometimes result  in higher harvesting costs, resulting in less money for  you as the landowner. Include just the requirements  you need to accompli sh your objectives, protect your  interests, and meet regulations including the Idaho  Forest Practices Act. Each project has its own unique  features and the development and administration of  your timber sale contract will need to reflect these  features.  Your contract is a tool that protects your interests,  conveys your desires, details procedures and assigns  responsibilities. A successful timber harvest depends  on both a well written contract and proper implemen­tation  and communication with the other parties of the  contract. You need to supervise the operation and  administer your contract to achieve your ecosystem  3  management goals.  Basic Contract Decisions  There are several basic contract provisions which  most contracts should contain. They include:  • Name and address of both parties;  • Legal description and sketch map of cutting  boundaries;  • Products being sold;  • Means of identification for cut trees;  • Selling prices, and payment schedule;  • Job performance guarantee and proof of liability  insurance;  • Effective starting and ending dates for sale to  include provisions for altering either date;  • Logging method and equipment restrictions;  • Scaling method and merchantability guides;  • Party responsible for acquiring and maintaining  access and rights-of-way;  • Special requirements;  • Signatures and addresses of the buyer and seller.  A sample contract follows as a general guide.  Remember there are other samples available if this  does not meet your needs or does not cover an item  that is important to you. A contract is a legal  document and it may be in your best interest to work  with an experienced professional consult ing forester  l if  and an attorney.  Sample Timber Sale Agreement  THIS AGREEMENT made and entered into this ___ day of ___ , by and between  ___________ _ of hereinafter referred  to as the SELLERS (usually the landowner) and _______________ , hereinafter  referred to as the PURCHASER (may be the mill or a logging contractor).

The yearly average  lumber price in 2005 was approximately 4 percent below  that of2004. After starting the year at high levels, lumber  prices declined in the first half of 2005, and spiked during  the hurricanes in late summer and early fall. Following  the initial reactions to the hurricanes, lumber prices fell  and then settled down to a modest level by the end of the  year (Figure 1). However, even with the slight decrease  in lumber prices, the 2005 average remained considerably  above the prices seen from 2001 to 2003. There were  numerous factors that impacted the wood product prices,  sometimes in offsetting ways:  • Domestic lumber consumption was at record levels,  with low mortgage rates encouraging high levels of  building activity;  • Increased demand for wood products in the  Southeastern United States due to the severe hurricane  season;  • The value of the dollar saw declines against the  Canadian dollar;  • Imports from Canada and other nations continued to  increase,  Dollars per  thousand board  feet lumber tally  500  450  400  350  300  Figure 1  Nationwide Composlle Lumber Prices  Monthly, 1990-2005  A ..

V'\\  2005  • Energy costs increased substantially, increasing logging,  milling, and transportation costs.  Raw material availability in Idaho continued to constrain  Idaho's industry in 2005. Timber harvest declines were seen  in the national forests, while on other ownerships, timber  harvest levels were about on par with 2004 (Figure 2).  Anum ber of infrastructure changes of note occurred in  December of2005; Stimson Lumber Company's Atlas Mill  in Coeur d'A1ene permanently shut down its production.  Furthermore, a new mill in Grangeville is set to start  production and will be replacing a mill that was in Elk City.  Idaho Industry Sales, Employment, and Production lor  2005  The estimated sales value ofldaho's primary wood  and paper products for 2005 was just under $2 billion,  approximately the same as 2004 (Figure 3). The wood and  paper products industry in Idaho employed about 15,100  workers in 2005, roughly the same as 2004 (Figure 4 ). Note  that the change from the Standard Industrial Classification  (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification  System (NAlCS) has made it problematic to provide  consistent and continuous time series data for employment  and labor income.

Estimated timber harvest for 2005 was  1.16 billion board feet, which is a decrease  of around 6 percent from the 2004 timber  harvest of 1.24 billion board feet (Figures  2 and 5). Lumber production in Idaho for  2005 is estimated at 2.0 billion board feet,  up about 2 percent from 1.96 billion board  feet in 2004 (Figure 5).  Curtailments from other than normal  maintenance were down in 2005 to 10  percent from 14 percent in 2004. An  increase in gross sales was reported by 54  percent of respondent mills, while increases  in production and profits were reported  by 62 and 39 percent of the respondents,  respectively. Furthermore, the number of  plants that made major capital expenditures  was up to 68 percent in 2005 from the 63  percent reported in 2004.  Figure 5 shows that timber harvest (bf  Scribner scale) and lumber production (bf  mill tally) were roughly equal from 1947  to 1983. After that time, timber harvest  began to decline while lumber production  continued to increase. This was likely  due to several factors. One factor was  improvement in sawmill efficiency. In the  mid 1980's, Idaho's sawmills started to  incorporate quality control and size-control  practices, improved sawblade technology,  and computerized process control.

Both of these factors led to real declines in the demand for timber. In  addition to these real factors, a third artificial factor was also introduced.  alIVERSlTY DF lOUD UBUIJ  Idaho's Foresl Products Induslry II  Figure 5  Idaho nmber Harvest and Lumber Producllon  1949-2005  2.20  2.00  - 1.80 .""!

Many Idaho sawmills began to re -tool during the 1980's to  handle smaller-diameter logs. By 2003, nearly 60% of all logs  processed in Idaho were less than 10"" in diameter (measured  at the small end). This exposed a weakness in the Scribner  log scale that resulted in under scaling of these small-diameter  logs and the appearance that timber harvest declined.  OUI/ook 'or 2006  Prices for lumber and other wood products in 2006  may be off somewhat from the levels experienced in 2005.  However, the prices are expected to remain well above  averages for the several years prior to 2004.  Total U.S. wood products consumption should be  down slightly from record levels in 2005. Housing starts are  expected to slow slightly due to increasing mortgage rates,  while the repair and remodel markets are expected to remain  about on par with 2005. Non-residential wood uses in the  U.S. arc expected to increase. Hurricane recovery activities  should increase demand modestly for wood products over  the next several years. Substantially lower duties on Canadian  softwood lumber may be partially offset by the further  weakening of the u.s. dollar.  Information gathered from t11e annual survey of  Idaho producers conducted as part of this outlook echo  assessments of slightly weaker markets and concerns over  timber availabi lity for 2006. Overall, 48 percent of the  survey respondents expect 2006 to be a better year, while  37 percent expect it to stay about the same as 2004, and 15  percent expect 2006 to be worse.  Nearly 70 percent of the facilities surveyed anticipate an  increase in production, whi le 75 percent expect to experience  greater sales from 2005 to 2006. Just over one-half of the  faci lities surveyed said they expected to see an increase in  profits from 2005 to 2006, while only 20 percent expect  profits to decrease. Furthermore, 40 percent stated that they  expect to see a price increase on their products, while fewer  than 20 percent of the respondents expect prices to decrease  from those in 2005.  Timber supply remains uncertain going into 2006.  Virtually all the surveyed faci lities that processed timber  stated that limited raw material supply was a major issue in  2005 and stated that they expect it to continue through  2006.  General market conditions were listed by nearly 90  percent of the mill operators as a major issue that will affect  their operation in 2006. Other major concerns expressed by  mill managers for 2006 include incre~ses in health insurance,  transportation costs, energy costs, and the avai labili ty of  qualified personnel.",,,2014-09-03,2018-11-02,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/fwres/id/198,198,68.pdf,/fwres/image/68.pdf,fwres198

Acknowledgments:  The approach of this publication and some of the text were drawn from the 1980 publication"" Site and  Stand Evaluation for Silvicultural Prescriptions"" (now out of print) by Ronald L. Mahoney, James A.  Moore, and Joseph J. Ulliman at the University of Idaho. Many active professional natural resource  managers have tested the publication over the years, as well as evaluating and field testing preliminary  versions of this publication. The final draft received critical review by James A. Moore, Professor of  Silviculture and Director of the Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative at the University of Idaho; and  Yvonne Carree, Extension Associate-Forestry, University of Idaho.

Evaluating Private Forest Ecosystetns for  Silvicultural Prescriptions and  Ecosystetn Managetnent planning  Ronald L. Mahoney, Harold L. Osborne, and PalTIela Town  Private forest lands in the Pacific Northwest are  generally managed to meet objectives specified by the  landowner. These objectives may be narrowly focused  on the production of specific products such as timber,  forage, or commercial recreation. More commonly,  landowners objectives are broadly focused on inte­grated  natural resource management that includes a  mix of measurable products, and less measurable  assets that are often collectively described as aesthet­ics.  Private forest owners increasingly understand that  they may control a parcel of land that is just a small  part of the larger picture. Therefore, they need to  consider the impact of their land management activi­ties  within a larger ecosystem or watershed context.  Equally important to private landowners is the consid­eration  that external land characteristics and activities  can impact their own land. The size and characteris­tics  of any ecosystem under consideration must be  delineated and described to fit the objectives and  technical capacity of the landowner, while considering  the landscape characteristics and impacts beyond the  property boundaries. Privately owned forests are less  constrained by regulation than public lands, but still  must be managed under state and federal laws includ­ing  forest practices regulations and the Endangered  Species Act.  Forest ecosystems are complex and dynamic. Land­owners  and managers must consider a vast array of  information to meet either specific or broad manage­ment  objectives. The evaluation process guided by  this publication can be conducted at several levels,  separately or simultaneously, to gather and organize  information. The forest unit evaluated can be at the  stand (a uniform site supporting homogenous forest  vegetation) level, the parcel/ownership level (usually  for smaller forest owners), or at the watershed level  (often crossing ownerships).  Electronic data collection, analysis, and synthesis  give natural resource planners and managers the  ability to measure and quantify current and projected  conditions for specific ecosystem components, such as  commercial timber, grazing capacity, or snag and  cavity tree retention. Many ecosystem components,  however, are considered important in forest unit  prescriptions or landscape-level ecosystem manage­ment  planning, yet are measured and recognized in a  more subjective, qualitative manner in the prescription  and planning processes. For example, we know that  internal soil drainage is an important factor in tree  survival and growth, and affects stability in strong  winds or heavy snows. We lack current research that  could relate specific, numerical measures of this  variable to tree responses. Consequently, we record  soil drainage in general terms as poorly drained,  moderately drained, or excessively drained. We then  develop management recommendations on that spe­cific  factor as it interacts with other factors. In most  cases, such a descriptive approach is very useful and  adequate for most land management purposes, and  makes wide application of informed forest manage­ment  feasible.  Most forest ecosystem components are inventoried by  visual observations and recorded in categories on the  form provided in this publication. Successful silvicul­tural  prescriptions and ecosystem management plan­ning  for private forests will usually require the  involvement of a qualified natural resource profes­sional.  Professional land managers can interpret these  forest ecosystem conditions and select management  practices which meet the objectives of the landowner,  satisfy regulatory requirements, and consider land­scape-  level ecosystem impacts. This publication  provides a form and format that is designed for use by  foresters and other natural resource professionals in  the Pacific Northwest. Although the information level  is designed for field evaluation by professionals,  landowners and others with training and experience  can complete much or all of the field evaluation, but  may still need professional assistance to interpret the  information and develop management plans. The best  land management will involve a partnership of the  landowner with appropriate professional assistance. A  related publication that provides a format and process  for this coached-planning approach, titled ""Forest  Stewardship Planning Workbook--An Ecosystem  Approach to Managing Your Forestland"" (PNW 490),  has been developed by Washington State University  and is available from Extension Offices in the Pacific  Northwest. That publication provides excellent  background information on the concept of ecosystem  management for private landowners, and on the  planning process.  In addition to this forest inventory, landowners who  have a strong interest in wildlife habitat management  should also complete the form provided in ""Evaluat­ing  Wildlife Habitat jor Managing Private Forest  Ecosystems in the Inland Northwest"" (FWR Station  Bulletin No. 60). Additional inventory of stream  environments on private forest lands is available  through ""Are Your Streams Healthy? Stream Quality  Survey jor Managing Private Forest Ecosystems""  (FWR Station Bulletin No. 61).  These publications provide the forms and format to  help landowners and professionals consider many  factors of the forest environment in the management  planning process. The completed inventories should  become part of the permanent record for the land, and  can be the basis for developing and writing plans for  management practices that will meet landowner  objectives. These evaluations should also show which  forest situations require additional examination by a  specialist in road engineering, forest harvesting,  vegetation or soils management, forage, fire ecology,  forest health, forest nutrition, wildlife habitat, water  quality, or other ecosystem components. The costs  and contracts associated with new and sometimes  more complex harvest systems directed at meeting  ecosystem goals are presented in two additional,  related publications titled ""Calculating Timber Re­moval  Casts Under Ecosystem Management"" (FWR  Station Bulletin No. 62), and ""Cantracting jor Timber  Harvest Under Ecosystem Management"" (FWR  Station Bulletin No. 63).  These field evaluations are not intended to reduce  writing prescriptions and planning ecosystem manage­ment  to a series of mechanical steps, but rather are  designed to ensure that many influencing factors are  considered during the first forest examination. In  addition, the information provided through the evalua­tion  process should help refresh the memory of a  resource manager who may write or review a pre­scription  or plan at some future time after the field  examination, and will serve as a record for subsequent  landowners and managers.  ;--., . :::-- .. . .,.

Once the user is familiar with the form, they may not need this section. The field form is located  at the end of the publication to make it easier to photocopy for additional inventories.  1. Name of field observer(s).  2. Date of evaluation.  3. Give the owners' name(s). Identify the unit to be evaluated and its boundaries (i.e. fence, stream,  ridge, painted, flagged, etc.); the unit may be based on total ownership, a forest stand, or on a  watershed-level ecosystem.  4. Legal description of the property location (i.e. NW 1/4, SE 112, Sec 9 T41N R3W BM.). Also  provide the name of the nearest town, and the county and state.  The following questions may be answered using aeriaL photography, topographicaL maps,  and soil and vegetation surveys, then verified in the fieLd.  5. Map names and numbers (include both aerial photos and topographical maps).  6. Size of unit.  7. Elevation (include the minimum, maximum, and average elevation).  8. Estimate the localized landform in terms of landscape contour and percent slope.  9. Record the overall aspect of the slope (if variable indicate dominant aspects).  10. Record the dominant soil types using a USDA soil survey book. Identify the type of bedrock,  and surficial deposits if present. Many Pacific Northwest soils are underlain by granite or basalt, for  example, and overlain by loess or alluvium.  11. Record the habitat type(s) if available from soil surveyor other published work. Be sure to field verify  and recognize significant areas of difference.  12. Record the indicators of past fires (charred stumps, charcoal, fire scars, etc.), and estimate when fire(s)  happened. Record fuel size classes as large, medium, or small for each fuel load class. [Heavy fuel  loads comprise a continuous cover of all fuel sizes over most of the stand. Moderate fuel loads either  lack continuity or a full range of fuel sizes. Light fuel loads primarily contain fine fuels with only  patchy residues of large and medium fuels. Large fuels are those greater than 4 inches in diameter.  Medium fuels include branches and other woody material 1-4 inches in diameter. Fine fuels include  duff, litter, grasses and other non-woody fuels, and twigs and branches up to I inch in diameter] .  13. Record the type and condition of access to and within the inventoried unit. Also include the type of  access to and within the surrounding landscape (may include neighbors' property) . Indicate the amount  of traffic on each type of road/trail (heavy, moderate, or light use). Describe any constraints on new or  redesigned roads.  14. Record the current dominant land uses of the inventoried unit and surrounding landscape (may include  neighbors' property) . Rank each use as primary, secondary, tertiary, etc).  5  15. Sketch a map of the surrounding landscape and the location of the inventoried unit. Show the scale and  orientation of the map . Indicate landmarks and land uses such as roads, permanent water sources,  agricultural lands, cover types, or buildings.  The following questions require field verification and are most meaningful when applied to a specific forest  stand or other homogenous unit.  16. Record the topographical position relative to local topography.  17. Estimate the air drainage conditions using topography as the main criteria.  18. Record the successional stage(s).  19. Record the forest canopy structure(s).  20. Indicate ""none"" if not cruised for tree data. If cruised or visually estimated, record observers, date  cruised, plot size and type, and number of plots. List basic data, summarized by species, of trees/acre,  basal area/acre, range of diameters, and volume/acre from the cruise or ocular estimate.  21. Estimate the level of current and historic foraging (grazing and browsing). [Severe foraging includes a  majority of the unit having soil displacement and compaction, erosion of heavily used trails, bare soil  areas, and browsing past current year's growth. Heavy foraging includes a patchy distribution of  otherwise severe foraging conditions, or overall less deteriorating soil and vegetation conditions.  Moderate foraging includes sites where the forage resource is fully utilized with little apparent degrada­tion  of the site. Light foraging occurs in units infrequently utilized for a short period of time with little  impact on soils or vegetation]. Indicate the animal(s) foraging or record the common name of other  domestic or wild animals.  22. Identify any water sources and indicate whether they are temporary or permanent. Record if  protected or unprotected, and the method of any protection.  23. Estimate the average thickness of the duff layer. Estimate the average size, range of sizes, and number  of down logs per acre.  24. Estimate the ground vegetation density, distribution, and list the dominant species. Ground vegetation  includes all non-woody plants (ferns, forbs. grasses).  25. Estimate the shrub density, distribution, and list the dominant species. Shrub vegetation includes  woody shrubs and seedlings less than 5 feet tall.  26. Estimate the subcanopy density, distribution, and list the dominant species. Sub~anopy includes tall  shrubs (i.e. Rocky Mountain maple, alders), and tree saplings.  27. Estimate the percent canopy cover, distribution, and list the dominant species. Canopy cover includes  the overstory trees.  28. Record the appropriate soil conditions using a soil probe, auger, clean profile of a roadcut, or gully to  estimate soil material and depth characteristics. Visual observation and general knowledge of the  potential response of local soils to disturbance are required to estimate the various soil characteristics.  Use this information to verify and modify information recorded earlier from the soil survey (item #  10).  29. Record the timber harvest history, including commercial and precommercial entries, year of harvest,  silvicultural treatment, species cut, and logging method.  30. Record any past site preparation methods, and chemical products if used.  31. Record historic planting information.  6  32. Indicate the condition codes of all tree species in the unit by size-class. Indicate P after the code to  show potential conditions. Indicate the extent of the existing condition by placing H (heavy = &gt;50%),  M (medium=25-50%), or L (light= &lt;25%) after the code. Indicate the seed source potential after code  27.  33. Describe the distance to and general location of any watershed/ecosystem constraints to the use and  management of the specific unit being evaluated, within or outside the ownership.  34. Describe how the unit contributes to the larger ecosystem.  35. Estimate and record the amount of time that can elapse prior to developing and implementing a  prescription. This will mainly depend on anticipated changes in the unit which would require a change  in prescription. For example, incipient insect outbreak, rapid loss of vigor due to competition, or loss  of stand volume to disease may require that a prescription be developed and implemented as soon as  possible (ASAP). A unit that would not benefit from a thinning, but will be more economically  valuable given another 20 years of growth, may be delayed for harvest/regeneration or other manage­ment  prescription.  36. List any additional unit evaluation by a specialist (i.e. wildlife biologist, hydrologist, harvest engineer,  etc.) and state why you believe such an evaluation is needed .  37. Describe the forest structure. ecological stability, ecosystem/watershed conditions, constraints, and  opportunities. Prescribe actions, giving goals and reasons as indicated.  7  I.

V ·  •  RANGE LAND IMPR OVEMENT PRACTICES IN IDAHO .  Introduction  The carrying capacity of many range lands in Idaho , like  most range lands in the West, has decreased since the advent  of livestock grazing. Thi s decreased capacity has caused many  land administrators to reduce the amount of grazing allowed on  federal, state and private range land.  In an effort to increase the amount of grazing on the  range lands in Idaho, administrators of public and private lands  h ave invested large amounts of capital for range improvements  such as brush control, seeding, and water developments. The  purpose of this report i s to: (1) provide a summary of the work  that has been completed in Idaho, (2) update an earlier p;Jblica­tion  by Sharp (1965), and (3) assess some of the possible effects  of these investments on the economy of the state.  Amount and Type of Improvement Practices  Considerable variation is found in the amount and type of  improvement practices that have been established in Idaho. Much  of the possible variation is suggested by the major vegetation  regions illustrated in Figure 1. These regions reflect the soil,  topography and climate that exist in each of these areas. The  vegetation potential of each area has been a major influence  in dictating the type of investment practices that have been  established on the range lands of Idaho. These vegetation  1  Figure 1 .

These land administrators have had the  major influence over the amount of money that has been spent for  range improvements in the state.  Investments on State and Private Land  The number of acres of seeding , brush control and the number  of springs that have been deve l oped on private and state leased  l ands within soi l conservation districts by county is presented  in Table s 1 through 3 . The se data indicate that relatively small  numbers of springs and acreages of seeding have been deve l oped  during the last two years. This reduced amount of improvement  is further exemplified by the change that has occurred since  1964 . Sharp (1965) reported that by 1964 a total of 425 , 492 acres  of range l and had been seeded in the state by private l and owners.  By June 30 , 1969 this total had been increased to 531 , 652 acres  (Table 2) . Thus, approxima t ely 116,000 acres' had been seeded  between 1 964 and June 30, 1969. This represents an annual seeding  rate of approximately 23 , 000 acres per year. The data in Table 2  indic a t e, however, that only 17,758 acres were seeded during  fi scal years 1 969 and 1970. This represents a substantial  1  Othe r agencies own and/or administer lands found in the  major areas illu s tra t ed in Figure 2, including the Atomic Energy  Commi ss ion, The Bureau of Indian Affairs, The State of Idaho ,  the Fish and Wildlife Service and other government agencies .  3  COUNTIES AND MAJOR LAND ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS OF IDAHO  Administrative areas  ~ forest service  ""-----'  bureau of l and management  private  Counties 1A Ada  2A Adams  1B Bannock  2B Bear Lake  3B Benewah  4B Bingham  5B Blaine  6B Boise  7B Bonner  BB Bonneville  9B Boundary  10B Butte  1 C Camas  2C Canyon  3C Caribou  4C Cassia  5c Clark  6C Clearwater  7C Custer  E Elmore  Franklin  Fremont  1 G Gem  2G Gooding  I Idaho  1 J Jefferson  2J Jerome  K Kootenai  1 L Latah  2L Lemhi  3L Lewis  4L Lincoln  1M Madison  2M Minidoka  N Nez Perce  10 Oneida  20 Owyhee  1P Payette  2P Power  S Shoshone  1 T Teton  2T Twin Falls  V Valley  W Washington  Figure 2 .

Similar changes in the rate  of brush control and spring developments may also have occurred  during this period, but sufficient data are not available to  confirm this supposition .  The data in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that nearly 40 percent  of the range seeding and one-fourth of the brush control has  occurred in Twin Falls County . If Cassia, a neighboring county,  is included with Twin Falls, the percentages change to 48 percent  for seeding and 28 percent for brush control. This indicates  that a relatively small area has received a major portion of the  range improvements that have occurred on private and state  leased lands in I daho .  Brush has been controlled on nearly twice as many acres of  private and state leased lands as have been seeded . Differences  in the development costs of these practices is one reason why  brush has been controlled on more acres than have been seeded.  Areas that are seeded generally require a minimum of one-two  year's deferred grazing . Brush control areas, however, do not  require a deferred grazing period. 2 If grazing is deferred on  an area that has been seeded, ranchers generally have to either  decrease the size of their herd, buy more expens ive feed to  replace the forage that is lost during a deferred grazing period,  or overgraze other portions of their range. These costs can be  sUbstantial in many cases. Furthermore, development costs for  seeding an area are generally higher than controlling the brush  2It should be noted that grazing may profitably be deferred  on brush control areas and is often required on lands administered  by federal agencies.  5  l  o~ a similar number of acres. For example, plowing and seeding  costs , excluding deferred grazing costs, generally range from  $4 to $25 par acre with an average of approximately $8.50 per  acre . Costs for spraying sagebrush, however, generally range  from $2 to $6 per acre with an average of approximately $3  per acre . This difference in capital outlay (development and  deferred costs) may have caused many ranchers to invest in  brush control rather than seeding . It should be emphasized  that this decision may not be the most profitable alternative  because seeded areas generally produce more forage and last  longer than do brush control areas . Furthermore, the relative l y  low costs of brush control may have caused some ranchers to  choose this alternative when it was not profitable due to the  lack of sufficient understory of grass on the treated areas .  The data in Table 3 indicate that a major portion (37%)  of the springs that have been developed by private land owners  have been established in Nez Perce, Owyhee, and Idaho counties .  Relatively large numbers of springs have also been developed in  Latah, Clearwater, u1wis, Kootenai, Twin Falls, and Washington  counties. All of these counties, except Twin Falls and Owyhee,  receive more yearly precipitation than do most areas of Idaho  and have received relatively small amounts of other range land  improvement . Reasons why these counties have not received more  intensive developments such as seeding and brush control are not  known a t this time.  6  •  •  •  ,  •  ,  •  National Forests  Allor major portions of fifteen national forests are found  within the borders of Idaho (see Figure 3). These forests have  been administratively divided into two regions. Region 4, with  headquarters in Ogden , Utah, administers the forests of southern  Idaho and Region 1, with headquarters in Missoula, Montana, ad-ministers  the forests of northern (generally north of the Salmon  River) Idaho. The importance of grazing in each region is re-flected  by the relative amount of range improvement work that  has been completed in each area .  Region 1  The St. Joe, Clearwater, Nez Perce and major portions of  the Kaniksu, Kootenai, Coeur d'Alene and Bitterroot national  forests are found within the borders of Idaho. These forests  are managed primarily for timber, recreation, aesthetics and  watershed. The amount of range improvement work that has been  completed in this region and reported in Table 4 reflects the  relative unimportance of grazing in this region.  The Nez Perce forest3 has received a major portion of the  range improvements completed within the forests of Region 1  that are found in Idaho. The relative importance of livestock  grazing in this forest has been a major contributing factor  in allocating the investments within the forests of Region 1.  3The amount of seeding reported in Tables 4, 7, and 8  sometimes differ from the totals reported by Sharp (1965).  The magnitude of the differences is small except for the Nez  Perce forest, however. The source of data (Region vs. Forest)  is the major reason for these reported differences.  7  7 NATIONAL FORESTS AND BUREAU OF LAND  MANAGEMENT DISTRI CTS IN IDAHO.

Region 4  The Boise, Payette, Challis and major portions of Cache ,  Caribou , Salmon, Sawtooth and Targhee national forests are found  within the borders of Idaho . Livestock grazing is a relatively  important use of land in these forests . These forests also  contain important recreation, wildlife, watershed and aes thetic  areas . The amount of range improvement that has occurred in  the f orests of this region reflects the importance of grazing  in these areas . Tables 5 through 10 contain summaries of the  improvements established in each forest between 1 961 and 1970.  The Sawtooth National Forest received a major portion of  each of the improvement s reported in Tables 5 -1 0: Fencing (29%),  Water deve l opments (18~) , Revegetation (59%), Plant control -­sprayed  and seeded ( 20~), Plant control --sprayed (18~), and  Poison plant control (9~). This is also the same general area  (Twin Falls-Burley) that received a major portion of the seeding  and brush control by private land owners .  Some of the improvement work reported in Tables 4 through  10 may have occurred in other states because portions of some  of the fifteen national f orests of Idaho are a lso found in  bordering states . The improvements that are reported in this  study f Or national forests in Idaho may therefore include some  tha t have been established in Utah, Montana , Wyoming or Washington.  9  Bur eau of Land Management  The Bureau of Land Management is the largest administrator  of grazing land in Idaho. It is also the largest investor of  funds for range improvements in the state . These investments  have been intensive as well as extensive in nature.  The data in Tables 11-23 indicate that a major portion of  each type of investment has occurred within an eight -year period '  (1959- 1966) . The overall low productivity of many areas, the  development of improvement techniques, the Halogeton glomeratus  Control Act of 1 954 , and improvements for pest control all  contributed t o the increased work during this period. It was  estimated, however , that 71 percent of the range land administered  by the Bureau of Land Management in Idaho was in need of improve -  men t work in 1 966 (University of Idaho and Pacific Consultants,  Inc ., 1 970, p. S - 26) .  More than $ 12,785 , 000 has been spent for range improvements  on BLM l ands in Idaho . Of this amount, the following percentages  were spent by designated district (see Figure 3): Boise (34 . 75%),  Burley (24 . 24%) , Idaho Falls (14 . 56%) , Salmon (8.96%), Shoshone  ( 1 7 . 32%) , and Coeur d'Alene (0.17%). Further differences in  the all ocation between districts is indicated by the amounts  spent per acre4 f or each district : Boise (0.89), Burley (2 . 30),  I daho Fall s ( 0 . 89) , Salmon (0 . 87), Shoshone (1 .1 7), and Coeur  d ' Al ene ( 0 . 09) . Thus , the most intensive amount of investment  4These values were determined by dividi ng the total amount  s p en t i n each district, as reported by the BLM, by the total ac r es  in that d i s t rict on June 30 , 1969 .  10  •  ,  •  •  •  ,  •  on BLM l ands has occurred in the Burley- Twin Falls area , which  also is the same general area that has received a large portion  of the investments that have occurred on private, state , and  Forest Service lands .  Several possible reasons m, ay/ be given for the relatively  large percent of the improvement work that has occurred in the  Burley-Twin Falls area. First, this general area was one of  the first areas in the state to be grazed by domestic l ivestock .  Furthermore, much of this early grazing was year long and rela-tively  heavy . This pattern of use made overgrazing nearly in-evitable  . The resultant deteriorated status of this area made  improvement necessary if livestock were to continue to be grazed  on these range lands.  Second, seedings at the Point Springs Project near Malta  were established in 1952. This project was one of the early  successful seeding projects to be established in the state.  This project has shown that a significant increase in forage  production can occur as a result of seeding an area to crested  wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum and A. cristatuml. Furthermore ,  thi s area has been used by range managers and administrators  to demonstrate the benefits of a seeding project to other range  managers and ranchers .  Third , improvements on private range lands have probably  been made necessary for the profitable use of increased for age  made availab l e on public lands .  11  Fourth, this area was one of the major areas that experi - 4It  enced an invasion of Halogeton. This invasion and subsequent  federally sponsored control programs allowed substantial invest-ments  to be made in the area .  Fifth, some of the federal administrators in this area during  the late 1 940 ' s and early 1 950's anticipated the increased pro-duction  that could be realized from range investments and helped  obtain the necessary funds for the improvements.  Impact of Range Improvements  More than 56 percent of the total land area of Idaho is  classified as pasture and range by Frey, Krause, Dickason (1 968) .  This makes grazing the most extensive use of land in the state.  Approximately 64 percent of the total land area of Idaho is  owned by the federal government and nearly 96 percent of these  lands are administered by the BLM and Forest Service . Nearly  all of the land administered by the BLM and approximately one ­half  of the land administered by the Forest Service is suitable  for grazing . The BLM and Forest Service therefore control graz ­ing  on two t o t hree times as many acres of range land that is  suitable for grazing as all other land owners and government  agencies comb i ned .  Private land owners have controlled brush or seeded nearly  1.5 million acres of range land within soil conservation districts  i n Idaho. This repre sents a sUbstantial portion of the range  land in these districts . This also represents an amount equal  12  I  r  •  •  ;  •  to the total number of acres of brush control and seedings reported  in this study by the BLM and Forest Service. It should be noted ,  however, that different periods of reporting are involved in  these totals . If the peri ods of reporting were comparable , the  BLM and Forest Service total would be larger than that for private  and state leased lands but would not likely represent as large a  percentage of the total r ange land area administered by these  agencies as that has been improved as has been improved by private  land owners.  It is not known what impact the preceding investments have  had upon the income s of ranchers in Idaho. The sOe inves tmen ts  have, however, probably helped make possible the large increase  in animal numbers shown in Table 2 3. These data indicate that  two major changes in livestock production have occurred in the  state during the past 20 years. First, there has been a signi -  ficant change in producti on from sheep to cattle, and second,  the total number of animal units5 has nearly doubled.  The change in livestock production from sheep to cattle  has been affected by several factors. First, there has been  a large increase in the demand for beef and beef products rela -  tive to other livestock products during the past decade . This  change in demand has helped make beef production relatively  more profitable . Furthermore, the introduction of synthetic  5An animal unit is assumed to be one mature cow or its  equivalent . The following conversion factors were used to make  the various livestock types comparable: cows and heifers 2 years  or over = 1 . 0 , heifers 1-2 = 0.75, calves = 0.4, steers = 0 . 75 ,  bulls = 1 . 25, and sheep (all groups) = 0.2.  13 UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO LIBRARY I  J  •  fibers has caused the demand for wool to decline. Second, some  administrators within the federal agencies have encouraged grazing  by cattle over sheep because sheep have often been blamed for  much of the extensive ""overgrazing"" that has occurred in the  West . Third, sheep ranches have found it increasingly difficult  to obtain reliable herders at a reasonable wage. Fourth, sheep  operations have experienced relatively larger fluctuations in  yearly income than cattle ranchers have recently encountered.  Fifth, the Forest Service has found it necessary to decrease  the amount of grazing on many high watershed areas that have  historically been used as summer ranges for sheep.  Investments for range improvements such as seeding or brush  control commonly increase the carrying capacity of a rehabil-itated  area many times. Furthermore, the increased carrying  capacity of a rehabilitated area may allow decreased utilization  of another area that may have been overgrazed. Thus, the manage-ment  of a rehabilitated area may result in increased carrying  capacity of other areas (Godfrey, 1971).  Some of the investments reported in this study have not  resulted in a net increase in the grazing of livestock. For  example, investments undertaken by the BLM have increased the  carrying capacity of some areas many times, but as the data in  Table 24 indicate, total permitted use of grazing district lands  increased a small amount between 1960 and 1969. However some of the  . .. • S : • ~  .....

Many of the impacts of these investments are unknown at  the present time, but additional research in this area should  help clarify the results that can be expected from a given range  improvement investment.  15  Li tera ture Cited  1.

DE IDAHO UBRARl  r  &lt;. , ; .. ,  ----~ ,  ~.  r  ;  •  A SURVEY OF FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT IN IDAHO  Introduction  Idaho is rapidly becoming the nation's leading producer of hatchery­raised  game and commercial salmonids, if indeed it has not already done so.  In the 1971 production year Idaho Fish and Game Department raised 1.824 mil­lion  pounds of trout and salmon (Idaho Fish and Game, 1973). The National  Fish Hatcheries in Idaho during the same period raised 0.645 million pounds  of trout and salmon (Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, 1972). The  commercial trout industry had an estimated production of 10-12 million pounds  in 1971 (Araji, 1972). The 1971 commercial catfish production has been esti­mated  at 75,000 pounds (Heffernan, 1972).  This report is a summary of a survey conducted to inventory the status  of fish health management in hatchery-raised salmonids and ictalurids in  Idaho. The information was gathered by conferring with the manager or, in  a few cases, the assistant manager of each fish-raising facility visited  (Appendix I). At each site a questionnaire (Appendix II) was completed inso­far  as possible and a sketch of the facilities was made.  Development of the Study  Since the survey involved asking questions that might have been construed  as personal in that the answers concerned production data, we contacted each  of the commercial producers of salmonids and ictalurids by letter inviting  them to attend an informational meeting at Rangen's Trout Research Farm on  4 November 1972. Of the 30 persons invited, 18 attended and discussed the  questionnaire per ~ and its implications. In addition we discussed our  future survey and service plans and made alterations as recommended by the  industry representatives.  1  After reviewing the information resulting from the 4 November meeting,  a subsequent meeting was held at Rangen's Trout Research Farm on 16 December  1972. Of the 30 persons invited to this meeting, 21 attended. The signifi­cant  outcome of the meeting was the formation of a Steering Committee to  investigate the many aspects of forming an ""Idaho Food Fish Commission"" to  function within the governmental structure of the State of Idaho. Serving  on this committee are: Mike Fennen (Snake River Trout Farm, Chairman), Ted  Eastman (Clear Springs Trout Company), Bill Jones (Jones and Sandy Livestock),  Mike Greene (Blue Lakes Trout Farm), and Porter Houghland (Crystal Springs  Trout Company) .  After the commercial fish growers had agreed on the nature and scope of  the survey, personnel of the Idaho Fish and Game Department and the Hatchery  Division, Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife were consulted for their  opinions on the survey protocol . They concurred with all aspects of the  proposal.  On 31 May 1973 we began visiting 2-6 fish-raising facilities each day  until 19 June 1973. During this period we visited 3 National Fish Hatcheries,  16 Idaho Fish and Game hatcheries, and 33 commercial fish-raising facilities.  The remaining Idaho Fish and Game Department and commercial fish-raising  facilities will be visited during July and August, 1973. The results of that  portion of the survey will be reported as an amendment to this report.  Description of Fish-Raising Systems in Idaho  Fish are raised in Idaho basically for two purposes; namely, for game  or recreational purposes and for commercial sales as live or processed fish.  A list of fish species raised in Idaho is presented in Table 1.  2  ·0  o.  •  --  --  Table 1: Species of fish raised for recreational and commercial purposes in  Idaho in 1972.  Species Facility Affiliation  Rainbow trout Federal, State, Private  Cutthroat trout Federal, State, Private  Brown trout State  Stee1head Federal, State  Golden trout State, Private  Kam100ps trout State  Makinaw trout State  Brook trout State  Chinook salmon Federal, State  Coho salmon State, Private  Kokanee Federal, State  Montana grayling State  Channel catfish Private  Blue catfish Private  3  - ----------------------  The game or recreational fish are produced by the Idaho Fish and Game  Department and by the Hatchery Division, Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wild-life.  Both agencies raise large numbers of trout and salmon of fingerling to  catchable size for release into public fishing waters of the State of Idaho.  Some fish are distributed to surrounding states by the National Fish Hatcher-ies.  During 1972 the three National Fish Hatcheries released more than 16  million fish and the 19 Idaho Fish and Game hatcheries released more than 8  million fish.  The commercial production of trout, salmon, and catfish consists of six  basic components:  1) Egg producers - there are seven commercial sources of rainbow trout  eggs in Idaho. Of thes e , four presently use the eggs solely at  their facilities. The remaining three have statewide and out-of-state  sales.  2) Growers - there are 17 separate companies (24 farms) raising rainbow  trout, cutthroat trout, coho salmon, blue catfish and channel cat-fish.  The majority of the fish produced are sold processed with a  few sales of live fish to fish-out operations in other states.  3) Grow-out or farm pond operators - there are at least 40 facilities  within a 10-15 mile radius of Buhl raising fish for growers. In  this type of operation, 6""-8"" fish are transferred from a grower's  ponds to the farm ponds for rearing to marketable size (approx.  12""-13"") with the feed being supplied by the grower. The time re-  -.  quired for this is 4-8 months and the farm pond manager is paid on  the pounds of fish gained. Many of these facilities do not operate •  on a year-round basis because of inadequate water quality and q,u antity .  4  4) Processors - there are seven trout and catfish processing plants in  the Twin Falls-Buhl area. They receive fish from growers and farm  pond operators. All but one are associated with a fish-raising  facili ty.  5) Fee fishing or fish-out pond operators - there are several facilities  of this type operating in Idaho. None were visited during this seg­ment  of the survey because it was thought that their involvement in  fish health management in Idaho was minimal. It has been determined  subsequently that several facilities receive eyed eggs or fish from  out-of-state sources, thereby being potential sources of certain  undesired infectious agents for fish.  6) Live-haulers - several fish farms haul live fish to out-of-state  distribution points for fee fishing operations. There is at least  one individual who contracts to haul live fish and is not associated  with any fish farming operation.  During 1972 the commercial production of rainbow trout was 27.4 million  pounds. From the survey data it is anticipated that there will be a sizeable  increase during 1973. At this time there are nearly 9 million more fish on  hand than were marketed the previous year (Table 2). Eleven of the visited  commercial facilities are increasing their production capabilities by 25-50%  over the 1972 production. These additions should all be in operation by  September, 1973. Thus, an industry which had an annual production in 1956  of 0.75 million pounds now ranks economically as the second largest food ani­mal  industry in Idaho (Araji, 1972). This phenomenal growth is attributed  to the tremendous supply of quality water in which to raise trout and salmon  and to the variety of markets available.  5  Table 2: Summary of production data for federal, state , and private fish­raising  facilities in Idaho in 1972  Federal State Private Total  Number of fish on hand  - 1973 11.6 17.97 47.75 77 . 32  (millions)  Number of fish produced  - 1972 8.1 16.00 38.65 56.22  (millions)  Pounds of fish produced  in 1972 1.04 1.54 27.39 29.97  (millions)  Food conversion  (lbs feed per 1.9 1.9 1.7  1b of fish)  Production cost per  pound ($) 0.78* 0.43* 0 . 37  Employees  (full time) 28 27 159  (part time) 18 16 13  *Includes transportation cost for distribution .  The channel catfish industry, on the other hand, is just beginning.  There are currently two farms raising channel catfish. In 1972 their combined  production was less than 100,000 pounds. However, as more 800F water becomes  available for catfish raising, this segment of the commercial fish industry  will increase dramatically. At this time there are more than twice the number  of catfish on hand as compared to last year's total production.  Fish Health Management Problems  The following infectious and noninfectious diseases were reported among  the fish being raised at the federal, state and private facilities:  1) Fin Rot (fin erosion) is a progressive erosion and disintegration  of the fins of hatchery-raised fish. Several species of bacteria  have been isolated from outbreaks; but the main contributory causes  are thought to be crowding and nutritional imbalances, especially  in the vitamins. Treatment and control are effected by external  antibacterials, sanitation, and management.  2) Tail erosion is associated with hatchery-raised fish and is charac­terized  by a progressive thickening and subsequent eroding of the  caudal fin. The thickening and erosion typically begins on the  dorsal portion of the fin. In many cases it occurs concommittantly  with fin erosion; however, it occurs also without obvious fin erosion.  The main contributory causes of tail erosion are thought to be crowd­ing  and nutritional imbalances. In severe cases the processed fish  must be sold with the tail removed thus reducing its value. There  is no known treatment once the erosion becomes advanced. The best  prevention and control is management.  7  3) Soreback is seen clinically as a clean-looking ulceration of the skin  and underlying muscle usually anterior to the dorsal fin . Current  theory on its cause is continual nipping by other fish brought on by  marginal underfeeding . Fish with advanced soreback are considered  unfit for release or marketing. The only treatment is to isolate  the affected fish and to increase the feeding level of all lots of  fish. It can be prevented by keeping all fish on a high plane of  nutrition from the first-feeding fry stage.  4) Strawberry Disease is a sporadic disease in which circumscribed areas  of skin become thickened and red . The underlying tissues become  filled with fluid. In many cases feeding antibiotics have reduced  the incidence thus giving rise to the theory that it has an infecti­ous  cause. Another theory on the cause is that it is an allergic  reaction to intestinal bacteria. In which case, the antibiotic is  reducing the population of gut bacteria thereby reducing the allergic  response. Fish with Strawberry Disease are generally not seen until  they are on the processing line at which time they are discarded  because of their unappetizing appearance .  S) Bacterial Hemorrhagic Septicemia (Aeromonas redmouth disease) is an  acute to subacute systemic bacterial disease caused by Aeromonas  liguefaciens. All species and ages of fish are susceptible and  losses are usually significant. It is traditionally a springtime  disease and is effectively controlled by systemic antibacterials .  6) Hagerman Redmouth Disease is an acute to chronic systemic bacterial  disease of rainbow trout and is caused by an, as yet, unspecified  bacterium. The disease is endemic in the Hagerman Valley of Idaho  8  and occurs during any season of the year. It is effectively con­trolled  by systemic antibacterials.  7) Furunculosis is a peracute to chronic systemic bacterial disease  caused by Aeromonas salmonicida. All species and ages of fish are  susceptible with the majority of outbreaks occurring in young-of- the­year  fish. Although direct transmission in saltwater has not been  adequately proven, marine fish have become infected with the organism  and subsequently died of the disease from eating clinically ill  salmon smolts following seaward migration. The disease can occur  anytime, is stress-mediated, and is effectively controlled by system­ic  antibacterials.  8) Bacterial Kidney Disease is a chronic, but may be acute, systemic  bacterial disease of salmonids caused by a Corynebacterium spp .  The disease is widespread and epidemics occur usually in the fall  when the water temperatures are declining. This disease is not  effectively controlled by the approved systemic antibacterials.  9) Columnaris Disease is an acute systemic and cutaneous disease of  freshwater fishes caused by Chondrococcus columnaris. The disease  is widespread and occurs most frequently during the summer in young­of-  the-year fish. Losses are usually quite high. In warm water  fish there is frequently a dual infection with Aeromonas liguefaciens .  The disease is effectively controlled by systemic and external anti­bacterials.  10) Bacterial Gill Disease is a peracute respiratory disease of juvenile  hatchery-raised fish (primarily salmonids and ictalurids) . A com­plexity  of environmental, physiological and bacterial are involved  in causing an outbreak. The disease occurs most frequently in the  9  springtime when the fish are actively growing and are crowded in low  dissolved oxygen-high ammonia water. The bacteria involved are, for  the most part, unspecified myxobacteria. Chondrococcus columnar is  has been implicated on several occasions. The disease is effective­ly  controlled by reducing the population density and administering  external antibacterials.  11) Coldwater Disease (Peduncle Disease) is a chronic external and system­ic  bacterial disease of juvenile salmonids caused by Cytophaga  psychrophila. The disease occurs during the low water temperature  months. Outbreaks with catastrophic losses have been reported in  yolk sac fry. The disease is controlled by external and systemic  antibacterials.  12) Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis is a peracute to acute virus disease  of juvenile salmonids - particularly the trouts and chars. It is  widespread and considered to be egg transmitted. Losses are general­ly  quite high in fish less than 2-inches long. The recommended con­trol  methods include chemical disinfection of eggs, elimination of  carrier females and depopulation of affected stock.  13) Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis is an acute virus disease of  juvenile salmonids. Until recently this disease was recorded as  Oregon Sockeye Disease, Sacramento River Chinook Disease, Columbia  River Sockeye Disease, and Leavenworth Sockeye Disease. The primary  species affected are chinook salmon, rainbow trout and sockeye sal­mon.  The disease is endemic in the western U.S . with sporadic out­breaks  occurring in other parts of the country. The virus is con­sidered  to be egg transmitted. Losses are quite high in less than  2-inch fish in water temperatures below 56 0 F. The recommended  10  control methods include chemical disinfection of eggs, elimination  of carrier females, and depopulation of affected stocks.  14) Ichthyophonus is a chronic systemic mycotic disease of freshwater  and marine fish caused by Ichthyophonus hoferi. Losses are general­ly  not very high; however, serious outbreaks have occurred. All ages  and species of fish are affected. There is no treatment. The spread  has been controlled by feeding cultured fish only inspected and  processed marine fish. Rigid sanitation and disposal methods also  have decreased the prevalence of this disease.  15) Saprolegniosis and Achylosis are two acute cutaneous mycotic diseases  of all fish. The diseases generally arise secondarily to pre­existing  bacterial infections or traumatic wounds. Effective treat­ment  and control methods include external disinfectants and strict  sanitation practices.  There are several hundred genera of parasites - protozoa, metazoa - which  use fish and shellfish as intermediate or definitive hosts. Of these, less  than 100 genera have been described as causing primary or secondary disease  problems in cultured fish and shellfish. For epidemiological and therapeutic  convenience those protozoa and metazoa causing epizQotics in salmonids and  ictalurids have been categorized by the portion of the host affected; i.e.  gills, body surface, and internal. The gill parasites and body surface para­sites  are effectively controlled by external chemotherapeutics and rigid sani­tation  practices. The internal parasites are usually controlled by disrupting  the life cycle. In some cases, internal chemotherapeutics are effective.  The mortalities in each of the four age groups of fish; i.e. eggs, 1""-  3"", 3""-6"", and 6""-12"", varied significantly among the three agencies. However,  the overall mortality was quite uniform among the three agencies (Table 3).  11  Table 3: Percent mortalities from all causes in federal, state, and private  fish-raising facilities in Idaho in 1972.  Federal State Private  Egg mortalities 10.0 11. 7 16.5  1""-3"" fish 10.5 22.6 15.5  3""-611 fish 25.0 8.3 6.5  6"" - 12"" fish ....Q.J. ....L.l ...&..d  x- 11.4 11.07 11.22  12  The approximate ratio of infectious disease mortalities to noninfectious  disease mortalities were 4:1 overall (Tables 4, 5, 6) . Most of the respon­dents  did agree, nonetheless, that many outbreaks of infectious disease were  precipitated by handling or crowding stresses.  The major cause of egg mortalities was infertility. Fungus (Saprolegnia  sp.) and silting were minor causes of egg loss.  The most frequent cause of mortalities in 1"" -3"" fish was gill disease .  It could not be determined if this was bacterial gill disease or some other  form of gill disease. All respondents reporting having severe problems with  gill disease stated that outbreaks were abated by using one of the many exter­nal  antimicrobial drugs. Thus, it could be assumed that bacteria were in  some way involved with the disease. Infectious pancreatic necrosis and in­fectious  hematopoietic necrosis outbreaks were sporadic in commercial fish  farms and the resultant mortalities were usually quite high. The most fre­quently  occurring noninfectious disease problem in this age group was fin  erosion, which is considered to be a management problem aggravated by crowd­ing  and underfeeding. Although there were no mortalities attributed to fin  erosion, the incidence was sufficiently high to reduce productivity of af­fected  lots of fish.  The most frequent causes of mortalities in the 3"" -6"" fish were gill  disease and ""redmouth"" disease. Again, it could not be determined if this  was truly bacterial gill disease; however, treatment with external antibac­terial  drugs was effective in most cases. The ""redmouth"" disease mortalities  were due to infections of either RM bacterium (the causative agent of Hager­man  Redmouth) or Aeromonas liguefaciens (the causative agent for Bacterial  Hemorrhagic Septicemia). Either type was controlled by feeding systemic anti­bacterial  drugs. There were many cases in which the incidence of the disease  13  Table 4a : Percent mortalities in four age groups by major cause in 23 pri­vate  fish-raising facilities in Idaho in 1972.

In these cases, the resulting total mortality was often greater than if treat­ment  were instituted.  The incidence of fin erosion, tail erosion, and IIsorebackll in the 3'1 -  6 "" fish was very high in the IFG and commercial facilities. The effect of  these diseases was greater in the commercial facilities in that the fish would  become esthetically unappealling. The only effective treatment was to reduce  t he numbers of fish per pond - an impractical measure according to most fish  farmers.  The most frequent causes of mortalities in the 6""-12"" fish were ""red­mouth""  disease, gill disease, and furunculosis. Most respondents recorded  significant problems with handling stresses and l ow dissolved oxygen. In  this size group the chief problem was the high incidences of fin erosion,  tail erosion, sareback, and strawberry disease, however, these conditions  seldom caused death. Fish with these diseases were withheld from distribution  or marketing until the disease signs disappeared with the result that they  grew beyond good market size.  Among the ""nuisance problems"" listed by the respondents were birds,  muskrats, frogs, snakes, visitors, and the increasing price of feed. At most  of the private fish-raising facilities, fish-eating birds were quite a problem.  There were no estimates on the amount of fish the birds consumed during the  course of a year. The greatest concern expressed regarding the bird problem  was the potential disease transmission - especially the transmission of in­fectious  pancreatic necrosis and infectious hematopoietic necrosis. The  viruses causing these diseases have been isolated from the ingesta and feces  of certain fish-eating birds (W. Wingfield, Ca lifornia Fish and Game, personal  communication, 1973). The remaining nuisance problems were sporadic but  17  caused concern - especially the price of feed.  The financial loss incurred due to dead fish in the commercial food fish  industry was calculated at $557,250 during 1972 (Table 7). This figure was  derived on the purchase or production cost of the following:  1) Eggs cost $3.50 per 1000 or 0.35¢ each.  2) 1""-3"" fish were worth 0.54¢ each (0.19¢ for feed and labor plus  0.35¢ egg cost).  3) 3""-6"" fish were worth 2.1¢ each (1.8¢ for feed and labor plus 0.35¢  egg cost).  4) 6""-12"" fish were worth l5.8¢ each (15 . 5¢ for feed and labor plus  0.35¢ egg cost).  The feed and labor costs were derived from an average production cost of 37¢  per pound exclusive of capital outlay. The average weight per fish in each  age group was obtained from the Manual of Fish Culture, Appendix A.l (Bowen  and Studdard, 1970).  Although the financial loss of slightly more than 0.5 million dollars  represents 7% of the estimated total production costs ($7.95 million), the  loss in the 6""-12"" fish represents 75% of the financial loss incurred (Table  7). The egg, 1""-3"", and 3""-6"" losses constituted only 6%, 8%, and 11% respec­tively  of the monetary loss.  It would be difficult to provide meaningful mortality cost figures for  the two game fish-raising agencies since they distribute fish of several size  groups. In addition, they raise several species of fish each having differ­ent  production costs.  18  Table 7: Production and loss es t imates by age group for 23 pr ivate fish-r  a i sing faci l ities in I daho during 1972.

These data were to be used to  provide factual background information to prepare a proposal to study the  cause, prevention and cure for the more significant diseases. What has emerged  is a better understanding of a highly complex but integrated industry that has  as many unique problems as fish-raising facilities. In addition, it is a  rapidly growing industry thus adding to the complexity. The federal and state  programs .are changing, not quite to the degree that the private sector is,  but sufficiently so as to make the data acquired obsolete in a few months.  One of the primary needs that must be faced before any disease management  programs can be implemented is the need for trained fish disease specialists.  At this time there is only one state fish pathologis t and one federal hatchery  management biologist. There are no such persons employed in the private sec­tor  . Industry representatives report that they cannot hire any because there  are none available.  The Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences Experiment Station anticipates  providing fish health management services on a limited basis this fiscal year.  As more funds become available this program will expand. The long-range goal  of the service program is to reduce the mortalities in the 1""-3"", 3"" -6"", and  6""-12"" groups by 50%. This is not an unrealistic goal. If realized it could  mean that, based on the 1972 figures, an additional 6.75 million fish will be  marketed at an increase to the industry of over $8 million plus the loss­savings  of $260,000.  Looking down the road, there are several potential problems facing the  entire fish-raising sector of Idaho's economy. Among these are: water  20  r  discharge quality, change in feed quality, and the pending fish disease legis­lation.  The impact of each is only beginning to be felt this fiscal year.  Of these potential problems perhaps the most serious and most difficult  to deal with is the change in feed quality. The Peruvian fish meal industry  is unable to meet the demands for their product in manufacturing fish feed .  As a substitute for fish meal many vegetable meals are being considered as  are other sources of animal protein. None match the nutritional quality of  fish meal and as a result will very likely give rise to a myriad of nutrition­al  disease problems that in all probability will lead to a higher degree of  infectious disease problems.  There are currently five pieces of proposed enabling legislation regard­ing  fish disease control being considered in this session of Congress. Each  private fish-raising facility has received a copy of at least one of these  bills. Each respondent was asked during the course of this survey for his  opinions on this legislation. The responses varied, as was expected, from  being adamantly against it to being moderately for it, provided certain changes  were made. All agreed that more in-depth studies must be made on fish diseases  before any such legislation could become effective. They also agreed that  there could be no blanket policy governing the diseases of fish in all parts  of the country. Respondents looked for the proposed ""Idaho Food Fish Commis­sion""  to carry the responsibility of recommending some sort of restrictions  on fish and/or eggs entering the State of Idaho. In this regard, it is  interesting to note that several potentially serious fish diseases have not  been reported in Idaho; e.g. whirling disease, channel catfish virus disease,  Henneguya sp., ulcer disease, vibriosis, and branchiomycosis. Every effort  should be made to prevent their occurrence in Idaho.  21  There are several ways by which the effects of present and potential  problems in game and food fish-raising facilities could be at least minimized  if not solved. At the top of the list is education in the form of workshops  and short courses. Any effective program of disease prevention or control  must begin with management. And effective management practices must be imple­mented  by personnel provided with all the techniques available. Week-long  short courses have been shown to be an efficient and inexpensive method to  update management practices in fish culture.  Next in line of importance in decreasing the disease problems in fish  is to give more attention to the disease transmission potential involved in  transferring fish and fish handling equipment inter- and intrastate. It would  be ideal if fish could be raised from the egg to release or market size in  the same watershed as the brood from which the eggs came; but it would be  impractical from a management standpoint. Therefore, the alternative is to  have a complete disease profile of each fish-raising facility and transfer  fish and eggs accordingly. The recent survey is a beginning to achieve this  goal.  In summary, this survey has accomplished several things, several of  which were not anticipated at the outset. First, a better understanding of  fish culture in Idaho and its attendant problems will provide potential ap­plied  and basic fish disease researchers a basis from which to work. Second,  the commercial fish farmers themselves have a better appreciation of their  part in the overall picture. Since the survey was made there have been  several reports of more personal communication among fish farmers to discuss  their mutual management problems. We would like to speculate that the survey  had some part in this. In any event their emerging cooperative concern does  22  create an air of optimisn that hopefully will culminate on the formation of  the ""Idaho Food Fish Commission.""  23  References Cited  Araji, A.A.

Before any information retrieval is attempted,  the entire guide should be read over in order to acquire a feeling of the  many kinds of information and literature which are available. Often the  complaint is voiced by the undergraduate student assigned a research topic,  ""There just isn't anything in the library on that topic!"" More likely, the  student is so overwhelmed with the amount of information in the library, he  hardly knows where or how to begin seeking out the information he needs. By  proceeding systematically with the use of this guide, you should in most  cases be able to put your hands on some pertinent literature in short order.  A few fundamental points should perhaps be stressed. First, define  your subject. Is your research topic really ""National Parks?"" If so, you're  very ambitious. How about narrowing it down to ""Crowding in National Parks,""  ""Transportation in National Parks,"" ""History of National Parks,1I etc . Once  your topic is precisely defined, you can proceed directly to the most appro­priate  literature sources.  The library card catalog (Section AI) when fully exploited in terms of  possible cross-referenced subjects , is a valuable start in any research  endeavor. Remember, once you find a current book which precisely covers  your subject, you have its bibliography in which to find a host of addi­tional  references.  Popular periodicals are excellent sources for (1) overviews of a subject,  (2) statements of current problems and events, (3) relections of professional  1 j  opinion and philosophical thought , and (4) advocacy points of view of the  agency organization or clientele group which the periodical serves.  Journals and technical periodicals generally presuppose a background  knowledge in their subject areas. They are scholarly and specific -- a  poor place to start if you know little of your subject , but a necessary avenue  when you are pursuing an in-depth study or very technical information.  The ""Matrix ... "" (Section G) relates broad subject areas in outdoor  recreation to both technical and popular periodicals likely to yield  information of value on a given topic. Look over magazines and journals  known to relate directly to a topic, for example, National Parks and Con­servation  Magazine if you are interested in national parks . This approach  will surely yield useful information. Start with the blocks of the matrix  marked with ""3's."" Spaces are available in the matrix to add further subject  categories and periodical entries of your own. Call numbers in the matrix  and elsewhere in this guide are those of the University of Idaho Library,  which are based (as are those of most university libraries), on the Library  of Congress Classification Schedules.  Abstracts (Section C) will be of greatest interest to the serious  researcher, and retrieval systems (Section F) will be of almost exclusive  concern to those pursuing intense or exhaustive study of a subject. A  number of useful, technical journals in psychology, sociology, economics,  and related fields have been omitted from this Guide since they are of prime  value to the specialist researcher who will probably already have knowledge  of their significance.  2  OVERVIEW OF SOURCES OF OUTDOOR RECREATION LITERATURE  INDEXES  (Not listed in order of use, which  will vary with each case)  tt A good place to start on a new, specific topic.  Good coverage of broad issues related to specific topics.  tt Identify the literature in broad topical areas  of outdoor recreation; you will still have to  consult the literature identified.  ABSTRACTS  tt Use after indexes and bibliographies.  Contain summaries of technical articles.  tt Especially valuable sources  are identified, e.g., people,  agencies, general references.  tt Stress philosophical and broad  management concerns in outdoor  recreation.  tt For the serious researcher who  desires an exhaustive literature  review of a precise topic.  RETRIEVAL  SYSTEMS  tt A good way to acquaint yourself  with a general topic area.  Use in conjunction with ""Indexes.""  3  ---------- ---------------------  Section A -- Indexes  Indexes are extensive, alphabetized listings of subjects which are  keyed to various types of literature. Some indexes are general; others  are specialized in the subject they cover. Some are technical, others  popular; and some are keyed to periodicals only, while still others may  be keyed to a wide cross section of literature, including books, pamphlets  and reports. Indexes are good places to start when you are first approach­ing  a new subject. Indexes list titles and authors and direct you to the  publication containing the title.  A-I Library Card Catalog  Don't overlook the value of the library card catalog. It may well  lead you to a current book which covers your topic well. More likely  than not, the card catalog will be at best a beginning in outdoor recrea­tion  topic research. Try as many subject headings as might reasonably  apply to your topic. If you are unsure of what subject headings are in  use in the card catalog, consult the Library of Congress Dictionary of  Subject Headings, 7th Ed., which enumerates subject headings in libraries  that subscribe to the Library of Congress Classification Schedules. After  you have exhaused the card catalog possibilities, move on to other ab­stracts  and serials.  A- 2 Environmental Information Access (Index TD/I/ES)  An excellent, currently up-dated listing of periodical articles on  topics relating to environmental concerns, many of which relate quite  directly to parks and recreation. For example, listed topics include:  environmental education, environmental design, land use and management,  noise pollution, non-renewable natural resources, population control,  pollution, transportation, parks and recreation, and wildlife.  4  ---------- --------------------------------------------------------------  -  A-3 Monthly Catalog of u.s. Government Publications (DGP/3.8)  A most valuable source in your search for outdoor recreation literature.  The u.s. Government has published thou sands of books, reports, pamphlets, etc.  relating to parks & recreation resource management. Search the indexes of the  monthly and yearly catalogs for materials in your area of interest . The subject  index is extensive, so check all possibilities. Try such subject headings as:  parks, national parks, state parks, recreation, forest recreation, recreation  vehicles, wilderness, economics of recreation, natural resources, environment,  environmental education, and others that may appear appropriate.  A-4 Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS) (Index H/1 / P8)  Similar to the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, this is an index  to books, art icles, pamphlets, periodicals, reports, and other materials related  to public affairs and economics. Though this guide is not limited to periodicals,  1,000 different periodicals are nevertheless covered. Many listings appear  under these subj ect beadings: ""parks"", ""national parks I ; , Iirecreationl1 and  related topics. A very good general source.  A-5 Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature (A1/3/R48)  This is a very useful guide to popular articles in all subject areas that  have appeared in r.~ny popular magazines . Look over the index to see what kinds  of subject headings you should pursue. To give you an idea, the following  subject headings are in the Reader's Guide index: parks, national parks, state  parks, recreation, forest recreation, forest management, recreational vehicles  and wilderness. Don't overlook the possibility of a specific subject title,  ""Grand Canyon"", for example, or specific place names. Authors are also indexed.  Remember, the Reader's Guide is only an index to popular literature, and is not  a sufficient device for in-depth research.  5  r  A- 6 Social Sciences and Humanities Index (Al/3/R49)  An author and subject index to periodicals in the social sciences and  humanities, including economics, geography, sociology, and related subjects  of interest to the outdoor recreationist. It is non-popular in orientation  and aimed at the ""humanities side"" of social science. A fair, general source  in terms of outdoor recreation.  6  ..

NOTE: See library card catalog, ""Bibliographies"", for additional bib1io­~=  apl dc possibilities.  8  r  ;----------------~-~ ---  Section C -- Abstracts  Abstracts are much like indexes except that they also contain summaries  (anywhere between fifty and a few hundred words) of the listed articles. This  is convenient to one seeking a main point or to one who wishes to preview an  article before retrieving and reading the whole thing. Abstracts are scholarly  and technical and are seldom keyed to the popular and semi-popular literature  that indexes often include. Abstracts are the next logical step for a re­searcher  who has consulted the indexes and obtained some general familiarity  with his subject and is now ready to seek out more specific information in  his subject area.  C-l Dissertation Abstracts (Ref. AS/ 30/ DSI and DSll)  An excellent listing of brief summaries of scholarly research conducted in  all subject areas. Begin with the Comprehensive Dissertation Index, 1961-1972,  which indexes Dissertation Abstracts by author, title, subject, and keyword.  Only after 1972 do individual volumes need to be consulted. Lists most completed  Ph.D. Dissertations. Should you desire a certain dissertation, it might be  available through interlibrary loan; otherwise it is available through Univer­sity  Microfilms, in which case you will be charged for xeroxed pages.  C-2 Psychological Abstracts (BF/ l/P6S)  A useful source of scholarly research summaries in human behavior, of use  to the serious outdoor recreation student pursuing research in user-preference  assessment, aesthetics and behavior, testing, psychological methodology, and  other behavioral areas. Abstracts are of articles in technical journals. See  especially these subject headings: ""social psychology"", ""attitudes and opinions"",  and ""groups and interpresonal processes.""  9  C-3 Sociological Abstracts (Index HM/l/S67)  A valuable source for the serious researcher in sociological areas, such  as social control, recreation and group behavior, social-psychology, methodology,  planning, environmental interaction. Abstracts are of technical articles in  journals of sociology and related fields.  C-4 Water Resources Abstracts (Index TD/20l/S4)  A useful source of abstracts of technical articles which include such areas  of interest to the outdoor recreationist as planning and economics of water­based  recreation. See ""Field 06, Water Resources Planning"" under the main  subject headings in the Abstracts.  10  Section D -- Miscellaneous  D-l Activity Magazines  The periodical matrix included in this guide (Section G) does not list any  of the scores of recreation activity oriented magazines. Entire magazines are  now aimed at specific activities, such as flying, boating, skiing, climbing, etc.  Consult these when your research involves such an activity, bearing in mind t hat  these magazines are popular and generally take a strong point of view toward  promoting their activity. They are, obviously, clientele oriented.  D-2 General References  The following general references will be useful in locating specific  facts, people, programs, etc. related to outdoor recreation.

Sierra Club  Society of American Foresters  Wildlife Management Institute  Wilderness Society  12  --- - --- ----------------------------  •  D-5 Current Legislation  The following sources are valuable to the researcher seeking information  on status of proposed and pending legislation relative to outdoor recreation  and resource management.  Audubon magazine (see Matrix) devotes a special section of each issue to  environmental legislation.  Conservation Newsletter, published monthly by the National Wildlife  Federation, covers legislation on environmental concerns.  Congressional Record, the actual record of proceedings on the floor of  Congress is published daily and is a complete record of Federal legislation  action. The Congressional Record includes a subject index.  National Wildlife magazine in its section, ""Report to National Wildlife  Federation Members"", often deals with the current status of park and recreation  legislation.  Washington Action Report, published bi-weekly by the National Recreation  and Parks Association, is perhaps the most valuable compendium of legislation  directly related to parks and recreation in America.  13  -- ---------------------------------------  •  •  Section E -- Conferences and Symposia  A number of outdoor recreation related conferences occur each year;  others take place periodically at various intervals. These conferences and  symposia are often valuable sources of information relating to the state of  current philosophical thought in the field. Some new, technical information  is introduced at certain conferences. Largely, they seem to be sounding  boards on broad topics, such as: (1) the state of the art (2) current manage-ment  problems (3) where do we go from here (4) new trends, etc. Recently,  conferences have begun to address themselves to specific topics or themes,  e.g., planning, interpretation, problems of leisure, etc. Conferences and  symposia are listed by title in the library card catalog. A few pertinent  conferences are indicated below.  Association of Interpretive Naturalists (annual conference)  Forest Recreation Symposium (held at State University of New York  College of Forestry, Syracuse, New York, 1971; produced Recreation  Proceedings, published by Northeastern Forest Experiment Station,  U.S.F .S ., Upper Darby, Pa., 1971. This is an excellent compilation  of current research and concerns in outdoor recreation.)  National Recreation and Parks Association (annual national and  district conferences)  North American Wildlife and Natural Resources conference,  Transactions (annual conference)  Rocky Mt. High Plains Park and Recreation conference, Colorado  State University (annual)  World Conference on National Parks (1962, 1972, and as periodically  convened)  14  •  -------- ---- - - ------- - -- - --  Section F -- Retrieval Systems  Retrieval Systems are basically indexes that are keyed to computers  which in turn are banked with abstracts and information on indexed subjects.  Each retrieval system has its own information emphasis area, and each recalls  information in its own way, e.g., by subject heading from its index or by  ""key words"" or ""descriptors"", e.g., ""recreation vehicles"", ""campgrounds Ii ,  ""noise"", etc. Retrieval systems are one of the sources the serious researcher  consults before he satisfies himself that he has made a thorough review of the  literature in his subject. Some retrieval systems are set up to give infor­mation  on research in progress and the names and addresses of researchers  involved. Some provide services free through educational institutions; others  may charge $50 or more for a complete computer read-out of stored data. Grad­uate  students working on theses should seriously consider the use of retrieval  systems. For more information on retrieval syst ems, talk to your university  librarian.  F- l Current Research Information System - CRIS  Sponsored by U. S. Deptment of Agriculture Service. Service is free to  researchers in cooperating institutions. Consists of abstracts and status of  current research with names of researchers invol ved. Data bank is based on  24,000 research projects from U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies (including  U. S. Forest Service) and state institutions. A valuable source for outdoor  recreation researchers and graduate students who might especially be interested  in current research in the U.S . Forest Service.  F-2 Educational Resources Information Center - ERIC  A retrieval system on topics relating to education, including environmental  education. Service is free to educational institutions. Consult your university  soc :..... . . 1 sciences librarian.  15  - - -- ---~ ~-- - ---- -  ---------------~~~~-- -- --- .

Specific articles are  requested, then retrieved by NTIS, which sends back xeroxed copies or micro­film.  There is a small charge for duplication.  F-4 Smithsonian Science Information Exchange - SSIE  A computerized retrieval system backed with over 170,000 summaries of  recently funded research. Updated daily, covers all fields of science,  including social science. Information on research in progress with names  of investigators. First search is $50 .00 for up to 100 retrieval summaries.  16  17  Section G Matrix of Suggested Value.s of --Selected.
