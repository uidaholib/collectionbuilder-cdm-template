Beavers  are  considered  to  be  the  largest  rodent  in  North  America.  Someone  who  is  searching  for  a  beaver  can  find  one  in  Europe  or  North  America.  Their  names  match  where  you  might  spot  them.  The  beaver  found  in  North  America  is  named  a  North  American  Beaver  and  the  beaver  found  in  Europe  is  often  referred  to  as  a  European  Beaver.  Have  you  seen  a  beaver?  They  are  often  spotted  in  ponds,  rivers,  streams,  and  other  bodies  of  water.  4  Characteristics  of  Beavers  Beavers  are  mostly  awake  at  night.  This  makes  them  nocturnal.  A  beaver’s  hair  is  waterproof,  so  beavers  will  not  get  sick  from  the  different  water  temperatures.  A  beavers’  teeth  never  stop  growing,  but  beavers  eat  and  chew  on  wood  so  much  that  their  teeth  always  stay  the  same  size.  Beavers  use  their  tails  for  guiding  their  swimming  and  scaring  away  predators.  5  Beavers  are  Mammals  This  means  that  they  are  warm  blooded,  they  have  babies  like  humans,  and  they  have  hair  on  their  body.  6  Beaver  Families  Beavers  are  monogamous,  so  they  keep  one  mate  their  entire  life.  If  one  dies,  the  live  beaver  will  find  another  mate.  Female  beavers  are  only  pregnant  for  3  months.  These  baby  beavers  are  called  kits,  and  there  are  usually  1  to  4  kits  per  litter.  7  How  Long  Do  Beavers  Stay  with  Their  Families?  These  baby  kits  will  stay  with  their  family  for  about  two  years.  After  two  years,  the  maturing  beavers  will  make  their  own  home  a  few  kilometers  away.  Once  the  beaver  has  reached  the  age  of  3,  he  or  she  is  ready  to  make  their  own  family.  Beavers  are  very  protective  of  their  homes  and  families.  Each  beaver  can  live  10-­‐20  years.  When  do  beavers  leave  home?  8  Beavers  Rely  on  Water  Beavers  build  their  homes  in  water,  and  they  use  water  to  protect  themselves  from  predators.  A  beaver  has  a  special  respiratory  system  that  lets  him  hold  his  breath  for  up  to  15  minutes.  9  Beavers  Build  Dams  out  of  Wood  Beavers  use  trees  for  eating  and  making  dams.  Dams  are  many  pieces  of  wood  that  block  the  flow  of  water.  Beavers  are  unique  because  they  are  actually  able  to  eat  the  bark  of  trees.  This  is  convenient  because  beavers  can  have  a  meal  while  felling  a  tree  that  they  use  to  create  a  dam  or  lodge  to  live  in.  Building  in  the  middle  of  water  helps  protect  the  beavers  and  their  kits  from  other  animals.  10  This  is  a  beaver’s  dam.  Can  you  tell  that  one  side  of  the  water  is  higher  than  the  other  side?  This  is  because  the  dam  blocks  the  flow  of  water,  so  the  direction  that  the  body  of  water  is  flowing  from  will  be  higher  than  the  other  side.  People  have  used  beavers’  techniques  to  create  their  own  dams  to  give  power  to  cities  and  states.  Beavers  are  one  of  the  most  hard-­‐working  mammals.  11  Beavers  Live  in  Lodges  Beavers  live  in  lodges  that  are  built  out  of  trees.  Their  entrance  is  underneath  the  water.  Around  six  beavers  usually  share  one  lodge.  When  the  beaver  first  enters,  he  or  she  will  enter  a  den,  which  is  for  drying  off.  Then  there  is  a  second  den,  which  is  where  the  beavers  spend  most  of  their  time.  Because  of  the  way  beavers’  lodges  are  built,  they  can  easily  withstand  cold  temperatures.  Beavers  often  share  their  homes  with  other  creatures  such  as  muskrats.  The  extra  helpers  gather  food  and  keep  the  lodge  warm.  12  Beavers  Can  Cause  Destruction  Sometimes  beavers  cause  deforestation.  Deforestation  happens  when  beavers  strip  all  of  the  trees  in  an  area  of  their  wood.  Beavers  can  also  cause  flooding  because  when  they  build  their  dams  the  water  gets  too  high.  They  can  also  cause  droughts  when  the  water  gets  too  low,  which  prevents  water  from  getting  to  another  area.  Most  of  the  time  however,  beavers  prevent  this  from  happening.  Beavers  can  prevent  flooding  or  droughts.  13  Where  can  you  find  a  beaver?  In  a  desert?  No  In  a  swamp?  Yes  In  Antarctica?  No  In  a  river?  Yes  In  the  Tropics?  No  In  a  pond?  Yes  Far  from  Water?  No  In  a  stream?  Yes  In  Africa?  No  In  North  America?  Yes  14  Glossary  Deforestation: This is a forest with little to no  trees.  Den: A part of a beaver’s home.  Destruction: If something causes so much  damage that there is no repair.

Page 3  Where are clouds? Page 4  Types of clouds Page 5-7  Our Solar System and clouds Page 8  Glossary Page 9  Questions Page 10 What are clouds?  A cloud is made of tiny water droplets that we can see in the sky. These droplets form together to create clouds.  There are millions of tons of water in a cloud.  Clouds form when water on Earth evaporates and  condenses up in the sky to reform water.  Fun Fact:  Clouds are white because the water droplets in it are so spread out that light is able to pass through it,  and gray clouds have too many water droplets for the light to get through.  Where are clouds?  Here are the different kinds of clouds and where they are in the troposphere. The troposphere is the region of the sky extending from the Earth’s surface to about 3-7 miles in the sky.  The clouds closer to the ground are made up of water droplets. The higher in the sky the cloud is it is made of ice crystals.  Fun Fact:  Snowflakes are made when ice crystals stick together.Types of Clouds  Cumulus Clouds  Cumulus clouds look puffy like cotton balls or whipped cream.  They are usually known as “fair-weather clouds.”  However, they can become thunderstorm clouds and then they are called Cumulonimbus.  Fun fact:  “The word cumulus means pile or heap.” Stratus Clouds  Stratus clouds look like blankets across the sky.  They are gray in color.  They make a light drizzle or mist of rain.  Fun Fact:  “The word stratus means layer.Cirrus Clouds  Cirrus clouds look thin and wispy. Instead of having water droplets, cirrus clouds have ice crystals. White cirrus clouds mean clear skies. Gray cirrus clouds mean rain or snow.  Fun Fact:  “The word cirrus means a curl or ringlet in some one’s hair.” Our Solar System and Clouds  There are a few other planets in our solar system that have clouds, but they are not made of water droplets.  Venus has sulfur dioxide in its clouds.  Jupiter and Saturn’s clouds are made up of ammonia.  Fun Fact:  Scientists have found that Jupiter and Saturn have formed water ice crystals in some clouds. Glossary:  Evaporation: where water becomes a gas because it is hot.  Condensation: where gas turns back into water because it is cold.  Sulfur Dioxide: a gas that smells like rotten eggs.  Ammonia: a gas that smells bad and is usually used in cleaning. Questions:  What is inside of a cloud?  How does a gray cloud differ from a white cloud?  What is the name of a type of cloud?

The coffee cherry's outer skin is called the exocarp. Beneath  it is the mesocarp, a thin layer of pulp, followed by a slimy  layer called the parenchyma. The beans themselves are  covered in a paper-like envelope named the endocarp.  Inside the endocarp lay two beans side-by-side each covered  separately by yet another thin membrane. The biological  name for this seed skin is the spermoderm.  4  The History of Coffee  Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian  Peninsula. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in  the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was  known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. Coffee houses  were quickly becoming centers of social activity and  communication in the major cities of England, Austria,  France, Germany and Holland. In England “penny  universities” sprang up, so called because for the price of a  penny one could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in  stimulating conversation. Coffee began to replace the  common breakfast drink beverages of the time, beer and  wine.  5  Coffee in the United States  In 1723 a young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu, obtained a  seedling from the King's plant. Despite a challenging  voyage — complete with horrendous weather, a saboteur  who tried to destroy the seedling, and a pirate attack — he  managed to transport it safely to Martinique. Once planted,  the seedling not only thrived, but it’s credited with the  spread of over 18 million coffee trees on the island of  Martinique in the next 50 years. Even more incredible is  that this seedling was the parent of all coffee trees  throughout the Caribbean, South and Central America.  Missionaries and travelers, traders and colonists continued  to carry coffee seeds to new lands, and coffee trees were  planted worldwide. Plantations were established in  magnificent tropical forests and on rugged mountain  highlands.  6  7  Steps from seed to cup  1. Planting: Coffee seeds are planted in large beds in  shaded areas.  2. Harvesting the Cherries: Depending on the variety, it  takes about 3-4 years for a new coffee tree to bear the  coffee cherry. When the color turns a deep red it is ready  to be harvested.  3. Processing the Cherries: This process must begin as  soon as possible to avoid spoilage. There are two  methods for processing the cherries: the wet or dry  method. The wet method removes the pup from the  cherry; they are separated and then soaked in large  water-filled fermentation tanks. In the dry method the  cherries are spread out on huge surfaces to dry in the  sun.  4. Drying the Beans: Beans processed by the wet method  are dried by the sun or in large tumblers.  5. Milling the Beans: Machinery is used to polish, grade  and sort beans by size and weight. They are then bagged  to prepare for export.  6. Exporting the Beans: The milled beans, now known as  green coffee, are loaded onto ships.  7. Tasting the Coffee: Certified coffee tasters evaluate the  beans and grade them for their overall quality.  8. Roasting the Coffee: Roasting transforms green coffee  into the aromatic brown beans that we purchase in  stores and cafes. Beans are roasted to about 550 degrees  8  Fahrenheit and the internal temperature is kept around  400 degrees.  9. Grinding Coffee: This pulverizes the beans into coarse  or fine grounds to be used to brew coffee.  10. Brewing Coffee: Running hot water through the  grounds makes the delicious hot coffee that we enjoy.  9  Popular Coffee Drinks  Americano: Hot water with a shot or two of espresso  Cappuccino: Espresso with a little bit of steamed milk  topped with a lot of foam.  Mocha: Espresso steamed with milk and chocolate  Café au Lait: Half coffee and half steamed milk  Espresso: Coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of  nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground  beans.  Latte: Espresso with steamed milk and little to no foam  Breve: Espresso with steamed half and half  Macchiato: Double shot of espresso with foam on top  Chai Latte: Half steamed milk with half brewed chai and a  pump of vanilla syrup.

A constellation is a grouping of stars that has  an apparent form or pattern.  4  There are a ton of different constellations  that fill the sky. Astronomers usually divide  the sky into 88 different constellations.  5  Out of the 88 constellations there are several  that people commonly recognize or have  heard of. These Constellations include:  • The Big Dipper (Ursa Major)  • The Little Dipper (Ursa Minor)  • Orion  • The Astrological signs  o Aquarius  o Pisces  o Aries  o Taurus  o Gemini  o Cancer  o Leo  o Virgo  o Libra  o Scorpio  o Sagittarius  o Capricorn  6  Chapter Two:  Constellations and their Mythological Stories  Constellations are commonly named after the  shape they create in the sky or a  mythological creature.  7  The Little and Big Dippers  The Little Dipper is a part of the  constellation Ursa Minor, or the Little Bear.  It contains Polaris, which is the name for the  North Star.  The Big Dipper is a part of the constellation  Ursa Major, or the Great Bear.  8  The Mythological Story  It is said that Zeus fell in love with another  woman and his jealous wife turned her into a  bear (Ursa Major). Her son was a hunter and  not knowing it was his mom tried hunting  her. Zeus then turned her son into a bear to  protect her (Ursa Minor) and grabbed them  both by the tails and threw them into the sky,  tangling their tails together.  9  Orion  The three starts in the middle of Orion are  known as Orion’s Belt. The belt is made of  three very bright stars making it easy to see.  10  The Mythological Story  It is said that Orion was a great hunter. In  order to impress the earth goddess he  brought her what he had caught. This made  her happy. Liking the result he went on a  hunting spree and brought a mountain of  animals to her. The earth Goddess was very  upset that he was hunting all of the earth  animals so she sent a giant scorpion after him  to scare him. This is why it’s said that Orion  is running from the constellation Scorpius.  11  Which of these are Real Constellations?

During my spring 2014 semester I had the privilege to study abroad in Puntaranes, Costa Rica. While I was there I studied Spanish and took other classes like dancing, surfing, and cuisine! I had an amazing experience in Costa Rica and loved learning new things about the culture. One of my favorite things to do in Costa Rica was to cook and to try new foods! Most of the food in this book I was able to eat and cook while I was in Costa Rica, and it was delicious!  3 Food Introduction  Food is very important to every culture and it plays a significant role in traditions. People around the world eat different things and have different traditional dishes that they eat. In this book I will have a brief preview of some of the food I ate and cooked in Costa Rica.  4 Rice and beans  In Costa Rica you will rarely see a meal without rice or beans. It is served up for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Rice and beans these are the two ingredients used in many dishes. Costa Ricans prepare their rice and beans in various ways.  One of their most famous way to serve it is in a dish called “Gallo Pinto.” Gallo pinto is a mixture of black beans and white rice sprinkled with onions, and spices!  While in Costa Rica I usually ate Gallo pinto paired with eggs, tortillas and an avocado! It was one of my favorite dishes!  5 Traditional dishes: Casado  The traditional Costa Rica dish is called a casado: which translated means “Marriage” and they described it as a little bit of everything. It is generally served items like black beans and rice, fried plantains, a chunk of Costa Rican cheese, salad, and a meat item, usually fish, beef, or chicken. Casados are also served with tortillas for wrapping.  6 Arroz con pollo  (Rice with Chicken) This is one of the most popular dishes traditional dish of just rice, and chicken  mixed with a variety of vegetables such as  peas, onions, and peppers. It is a custom to bring this dish to birthday parties, and family gatherings.  7 Ceviche  Ceviche is a popular Boca (appetizer) consisting of  fresh raw fish marinated in citrus juices such as lime with diced herbs and veggies. In Costa Rica, the best ceviche is made with local white, sea bass, garlic, hot pepper, onion, and celery.  8 Fruits Fruit is very popular in Cost Rico. Because of the climate, fruit is readily available. In fact, in my home in Costa Rica I had a  Mango tree in my back yard!  Some of the most common fruits you will see in Costa Rica are:  1.). Star Fruit  2.)Cas (a fruit native to only Costa Rica) 3.) Guanabana  4.) Passion Fruit  5.) Black berry  6.) Papaya  7.) The manzana de agua (water apple) is a dark red, pear-shaped fruit that is full of juice and quite refreshing.  9 Bananas and Plantains  While I was in Costa Rica I had bananas at almost every meal. I was surprised at all of the different ways to cook bananas. The plantain, has the appearance of a large banana, but cannot be eaten raw. It is sweet and delicious when fried or baked, and will often accompany most  meals. When sliced thinly and deep fried, the plantain becomes a  crunchy snack like a potato chip.  10 Vegetables  Thanks to the abundance of fresh produce available in the country’s forests, Costa Rican cuisine relies heavily on fresh vegetables for their diet. Some of the most common vegetables used are potatoes, zucchini, sweet red peppers, and sweet corn. There are many vendors who sell fresh vegetables in the street markets. They also have farmers who will go door to door and sell their products to the locals.  11 Desserts  Because it was so hot in Costa Rica there are many people who sell ice cream. Vendors, or people who sell things, had ice cream stands where they served traditional ice cream but some of them had a twist different from the ice cream you see in America. One example of this is adding corn flakes on top of some ice cream.  12 Beverages  Coconut Water: This is a very popular drink served commonly in the beach towns in Costa Rica. Locals use large knifes to cut a slit open so you can drink from it.  Refrescos are natural, fresh squeezed fruit juices mixed with water or milk, with sugar added. There are an impressive amount of refrescos available in Costa Rica. I had a refresco every morning for breakfast!  13 Beverages  Café: coffee is a very big export of Costa Rica and helped to build the economy of Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, they have many local brands of coffee like Britt.  14 Graphic Organizer Costa Rica vs. America  15 Comprehension Questions  1.) What is considered a staple in Costa Ricans diets?  2.) Name one traditional meal in costa Rica.  3.) Which beverage is most famous in Costa Rica?  4.) What is a difference between food in America and in Costa Rica?  16 Glossary  Boca: Costa Rican slang for Snack Export: a product that is produced by a country and sent to another country.

These parts allow our body to soak them up and blend them into the body to use for energy.  4  Steps  There are three main parts that make up the digestive system: the mouth, the stomach, and the intestines.  6  Stomach  After you swallow your food, it goes to the stomach for several hours. Here is where digestive fluids break down food even more.  Which do you think stays in your stomach for longer?  7  Breakdown!  Watermelon breaks down faster, so only stays in your stomach for about 20 minutes. A tomato takes about 40 minutes to break down completely.  Why do you think this is?  Watermelon is mostly water, so the molecules wouldn’t be as hard to break down as the tomato. 8  Small intestine  This is the last step of the breakdown of food. From here, the small molecules of food enter the bloodstream and travel all over your body to give you energy  Large intestine  Food that cannot be transported into the bloodstream goes to the large intestine. You get rid of the food that is stored here by going to the bathroom.  These parts actually make up one really long tube! 9  Use what you know to fill out this diagram of the digestive system!  10  COMMON CORE STANDARDS  CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RI.5.4 Determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a text relevant to a grade 5 topic or subject area.

Dogs  originated in central Asia and have been  companions to humans as far back as 13,000  BC. Wolves were run off of camps until  people realized that it was cleaner to have  them around because they ate garbage and  rats. Later people also realized that they  would bark as an alarm when something was  approaching.  4  These early wolves were hungry and realized  that it was easy to scavenge food off of  people. The nicest and most docile wolves  became smarter and had pups that were  more and more smart and docile. Eventually  these wolves were no longer considered  wolves and became what we now know of  today as dogs.  5  Breeding  Today dogs all come in different shapes and  sizes, and have different purposes. This is  because people breed dogs to be that way.  How this works is that if someone wanted a  taller dog they would breed the two tallest  dogs. If they wanted a small dog that would  breed the smallest together. If they wanted a  good hunting dog they would breed a pair of  dogs that were the best at smelling and  tracking.  6  Breeds  Worldwide there is around 340 different dog  breeds. That means that 340 different types  of dogs all came from the same ancestors,  the wolves. From the largest to the smallest  dogs, they all have wolves as their oldest  ancestors.  7  Habitat and Diet  Currently dog’s habitats are human homes  and yards. This can range from apartments  to ranches and farms, anywhere that a  human lives.  A dog’s diet consists of scraps they find,  animals they may catch, and mainly processed  food given to them by their owners. Dogs  were carnivorous but domestic dogs are  omnivorous eating grains, vegetable, and  meats.  Lifecycle  Puppy-A puppy is born and needs to be with  its mother for a full 8 weeks. The puppy  stage ends at 6 to 18 months.  Adolescence- At 6 to 18 months the puppy  begins to start adolescence where  hormones begin to kick in and it reaches its  adult size  8  Adult Dog- Dogs reach adulthood between  1 and 3 years old. They are less energetic but  should be well trained at this point.  Senior- Dogs reach old age between 6 and  10 years, normally their muzzle with turn  gray, and they will be more tired and calm.  Fun Facts about Dogs  -Dogs have a really good sense of smell, they  are able to differentiate smells that are lower  than 1 million times that which a human can.  -They can hear sounds that are four times  the distance away than a human can.  -Average lifespan of a dog is 10 to 14 years.  9  -Dogs tend to have more than one puppy at  a time and those puppies are called a litter.  -There is said to be 400 million dogs on the  planet.  -Dogs have formed such strong bonds with  humans they have earned the nickname  “man’s best friend.”  10  Uses of Dogs  Dogs can perform various tasks for humans  such as:  Hunting  Shepherding  Companionship  Aides  And more!  11  Questions  1.

That is as hot as the sun! Because of such immense pressure, rocks remain solids and liquids, instead of turning to gasses. Only 50km (30 mi) beneath the surface, it is already almost 1000°F! It also has a pressure of 200,000psi (pressure per square inch), bike tires are about 35psi.  The temperatures increase as you go deeper into the earth, with the Lithosphere, compromised of the Crust and upper mantle, being the coolest averaging about 300-500°C. The Asthenosphere is the next layer, averaging about 1,300°C, making it slightly more fluid than the lithosphere above it. It transitions into the place called the “Moho,” or Mohorovicic discontinuity, or the point between the crust and the mantle below. The Upper Mantle is much stronger than the asthenosphere at about 500-900°C, and the Lower Mantle is denser and hotter, reaching temperatures over 4,000°C. Finally, the Core is the hottest at about 5,000°C, being the most “gooey” of the layers.  3 4 Composition  Each layer has a distinct set of rocks and minerals that make it unique, however they all contain some of the same things, such as iron. Despite their similarities, the differences in composition are what define the layers, causing them to be distinct.  Earth’s crust is much like a “skin” consisting of two types, oceanic and continental. Oceanic crust is mainly basalt with limestone, serpentine, and clay. Continental crust consists of mostly granite and some quartz. The upper mantle is thought to contain rocks such as olivine, peridotite, and garnet. These shift at the Moho because of high pressure and are replaced by more stable minerals such as perovskite. The rest of the mantle consists of other iron-rich rocks.  The core is divided into the outer and inner core because of the distinctions between the state of iron at the depths. The outer core is liquid iron, flowing plastically. The inner core, however is solid because of such extreme pressure.  5 This diagram shows the different layers of the Earth as well as how thick they are. It also tells how the elements and minerals behave at those conditions  Stop and Think!  1. How do the layers temperatures affect the materials as you move deeper through the layers? (ex: The Lithosphere is very rigid, does that change as you move into the Asthenosphere?)  6 Chapter 2: The Layers  Lithosphere  The lithosphere consists of the crust and the upper mantle. As we read before, crust can be divided into two different types, continental and oceanic crust. Both types “float” on the denser mantle.  Continental crust is about 25-90 km (15-55 mi) thick and divided into tectonic plates. These plates move slowly (just a few centimeters) each year over the more fluid mantle. The tectonic plates make up distinct regions of the earth’s surface such as continents.  Oceanic crust, which is much thinner than continental crust at only 6-11km (3-6 mi) thick, is where new crust is formed. This can happen by two plates moving apart and magma from the asthenosphere coming up and cooling to form new seafloor.  7 Asthenosphere  The Asthenosphere is more fluid than the rigid Lithosphere above it, with a plastic-like texture. This is due to the increased temperature and pressure that rocks experience as they descend into the Asthenosphere from the Lithosphere, making them molten.  The molten nature of the Asthenosphere makes it possible for plate tectonics to happen. If the plates were not able to shift on the semi- liquid region, then new mountains would not form, and the theory of Pangaea, the supercontinent of 300mil years ago, would not exist. Mountains are formed when two plates converge, or flow towards each other, and possibly even cause asthenospheric material to flow up through causing a volcano. Asthenosphereic material can also escape to the surface when plates move away from each other, or diverge. The Asthenosphere is the supplier of new material for the Lithosphere and replaces the lithospheric material as it is cycled through, as shown in the diagram on page 7.  8 See how the Asthenosphere tends to be thicker under the oceanic crust, where new Lithosphere is forming.  9 Mantle  We move from the Asthenosphere into the Upper Mantle through the Mohorovicic discontinuity, or Moho. The Moho is characterized by a drastic increase in seismic rate, discovered by Andrija Mohorovicic in 1909. The Upper Mantle is fairly plastic, relative to the layers above it. Not much is known about the seismic activity of the Lower Mantle, but scientists assume that it is relatively consistent.  Since the mantle is molten, flowing freely, it has convections similar to those that occur when boiling water on a stove. The magma heats as it gets closer to the Core and rises closer to the Asthenosphere, cooling as it gets closer and falling again to be heated and rising again, continuously cycling.  10 Core  The Core is something that scientists can only make hypothesis about because it is so deep in the earth that no instrument could make it that far down, even if it was long enough. The temperatures and pressure are so extreme that anything would be destroyed before any data was accumulated.  What we do know is that there are two parts, an Outer Core and an Inner Core. The Outer Core is liquid iron alloy, at extremely high temperatures flowing molten. The Inner Core is thought to be solid iron, and has been thought to be pure iron for many years until recently. Scientists have been studying the core’s density and testing it to see if a lighter element may be present in addition to iron.  11 Stop and Think!  1. Why might there be such a difference in the thickness between Oceanic and Continental Crust?  2. How does the Asthenosphere make plate tectonics possible?  3. What is the Mohorovicic discontinuity, or Moho?  4. What is the difference between the Outer and Inner Core?  12 Chapter 3: Folklore, Hollow Earth  Origins  The legend of the earth having a hollow center stems back to a wide variety of peoples. The most common belief is that the center of the earth is a place for afterlife. Ancient Greeks called it the underworld, it has been referred to as the Christian hell, and the Jewish Sheol to name a few. Others believed it was the source of life, such as the Angami Naga tribe in India and the Mandan Native Americans.  What connects all these communities is the belief that the entrance or exit to the middle of the earth is through tunnels. They believed that caves or tunnels would extend all the way down through the layers of the earth. These were incredibly important and sometimes sacred places.  13 The Theory through the Centuries  In the 19th Century, 1692, Edmond Halley suggested a hollow shell of 500 miles thick with two shells within one another separated by their own atmospheres. This theory suggested that people could inhabit the shells, due to the atmospheres. However, it was not until later that the concept was thought about more seriously.  John Cleves Symmes Jr suggested hollow shells about 810 miles with openings at both poles with four inner shells in 1818. This is the most famous Hollow Earth theory and he became well known. Symmes proposed an expedition to the North Pole hole to try and prove his theory, asking president John Quincy Adams. Adams said he would approve the journey but left office before he could do so. The next president, Andrew Jackson, said he would not support the mission.  14 The 20th Century brought many theories such as that of Atlantis by Walburga, Lady Paget. She claimed that cities existed under a desert and would be discovered once the 21st Century came. Another theory came from Dr. Raymond Bernard who claimed that UFOs came from inside the earth in his book The Hollow Earth in 1964 as well as hollow worlds. He even theorized that the people of Atlantis were the first to pilot flying saucers.  Disproving Hollow Earth Theory  The theory of Hollow Earth was further researched in the late 20th Century through a variety of methods. One of the most credible ways was through seismic studies. These showed that the time it would take for the seismic waves to travel through solid rock, liquid alloy, and solid nickel iron (such as in a earth that has all the layers) matched the gathered data much more accurately, and that a hollow earth was almost impossible.  Another method of disproval was through the analysis of gravity. It is known that enormous objects have a tendency to pull together, forming a non-hollow sphere that also has a gravitational pull of its own; displayed by stars and planets. If, however, the earth did defy this and was hollow, someone could not  15 stand on the inner surface because there would be such a strong pull outwards. This is because of the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation.  The last way that scientists have disproved the theory of Hollow Earth is through direct observation. Have you ever thought that maybe you could “dig to the other side of the world?” Well, the deepest hole ever was the Z- 44 Chayvo Oil Well, offshore of Russia, which was 12,376m (40,604ft) deep. Because of this, scientists believe that there is no way that a Hollow Earth could exist.  The Chayvo Yastreb land rig is the research center and testing site for the Z-44 Chayvo Oil Well, the deepest hole ever drilled into the earth.  16 Stop and Think!  1. What is similar about all of the beliefs about the Hollow Earth theory held by early cultures?  2. How are the theories proposed by the scientists of the 19th and 20th centuries similar and how are they different?  3. What do you think is the most convincing evidence against the Hollow Earth theory?  17 Glossary  Accumulated: To gather or collect, often in gradual degrees.

The Eastern Tailed-Blue butterfly, is an insect that is located in the western United States. These butterflies are found in California, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. This butterfly has grayish blue wings. Male butterflies have a lighter blue on the inside and females have a dark gray color on the inside.  The male  The female  The Eastern Tailed-Blue is often found in meadows and open fields close to the ground. The Life Cycle  Like all butterflies, the Eastern Tailed-Blue butterfly goes through a metamorphosis.  The first stage is the caterpillar stage or the larvae stage.  The second stage is the hibernating stage, or the pupating stage.  The last stage is the adult stage, which is what we see as a full grown butterfly.  What Do They Eat?  As a caterpillar, the Eastern Tailed-Blue mainly eats yellow, sweet clover, regular clobber, wild peas, and alfalfa.  As an adult, they eat mostly nectar found in flowers close to the ground, due to their low flight patterns. This includes white sweet clover, Shepard’s needle, wild strawberry, cinquefoils, asters and winter cress.  Cress Wild strawberry  Alfalfa Sweet Pea  Ant Army  In certain parts, the different types of food the Eastern Tailed-Blue butterfly eat causes the adult butterflies to produce a strange substance that certain types of ants like. In return for this liquid, the ants protect the eggs the females lay in flowerbeds.  Flower Cradle  Unlike most butterfly species, the Eastern Tailed-Blue lays their eggs in flowerbeds of their home. This is to protect the eggs, and to give the butterflies a better chance to watch the eggs.  Glossary of Terms  Metamorphosis: The change that insects go through to get to adulthood. It often contains at least two stages, like the Eastern Tailed-Blue butterfly.  The Larvae Stage: Also known as the caterpillar stage. One of the stages during the life cycle, often thought of as the baby stage.  Pupating stage: The second stage of the life cycle. This is when the caterpillar creates a shell around itself so it can change into an adult butterfly.  Regular clobber: a green plant that the Eastern Tailed-Blue butterfly caterpillar eats.  Alfalfa: a plant of the legume family that often has purple flowers. The Eastern Tailed-Blue butterfly caterpillar eats these.  Shepard’s Needle: a white flower that came from Europe that is often known for its needle-like petals. The Eastern Tailed-Blue butterfly eats these.  Cinquefoils: a plant of the rose family that has five-petals, yellow flowers, and several leaves on one stalk.  Asters: a plant of the daisy family that has bright petals, normally purple or pink in color.

Elephants weigh 2 to 7 tons depending on the  species and the region they are from. They are light and dark shades of grey. An elephant’s trunk is a  long nose that has many uses. A trunk helps the elephant smell, breathe, drink, communicate, and grab  things. Both female and male elephants have beautiful ivory tusks. Tusks are useful when digging for  food and stripping bark from trees. When male elephants battle they use their tusks. Elephants’ large ears  are not only used for hearing. When it is hot in Africa and Asia their ears radiate heat to help keep them  cool and comfortable.  Two Types of Elephants  There are two types of elephants: African and Asian. African elephants are  slightly larger than Asian elephants. The easiest way to differentiate between species is  their ears. African elephants have ears somewhat shaped like Africa. Asian elephants  have smaller, rounder ears.  The habitat for African elephants includes tropical forests, grasslands,  woodlands, and savannas. Asian elephants’ habitats are primarily tropical forests.  Both African and Asian elephants migrate throughout the year. African elephants have  been recorded migrating over 62 miles. Asian elephants have been recorded migrating  between 12 and 31 miles. Elephants migrate during the dry season.  Elephant Families  Elephants live in a herd. A herd consists of all female elephants and their babies. Male  elephants live with the females until the age of twelve, and then they live on their own. Males will visit  female herds every once in a while to mate.  In each herd there is one elder female who is in charge. The leader is always on the lookout for  danger. Elephants have no natural enemies, but hyenas and lions are classified as elephant predators.  They prey on young elephants when there is nothing else to eat. The entire herd protects the babies.  Everyone works together to keep them safe.  Baby Elephants  A baby elephant is called a calf. On average calves range from being 3ft tall and weigh up to  264 lbs. Newborn male African elephants can weigh as much as 364 lbs. Within minutes calves are  able to stand on their own. Calves begin their journey with the herd in just two days.  Mother elephants and the rest of the herd are constantly teaching the new calves. They will learn  which plants are edible and how to reach them. Calves nurse for the first six months of life. Their tusks  begin to develop between four and six months. This allows them to pick grasses and leaves to help  supplement their diet.  Elephants Endangered  Elephants are an endangered species. The greatest threats they face are poaching, habitat loss,  and conflict with humans. Elephants are poached for their ivory tusks. There are many wildlife  foundations around Africa and Asia to help orphaned elephants survive.  If a baby elephant is orphaned and does not get help they will die within days. Elephants are  loving animals, and without love and support they cannot survive. One organization in Africa is called  the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. These orphanages help calves grow and socialize so they can be  released back into the wild. All of the elephant orphans from this wildlife trust have created their own  herd. They are constantly welcoming new orphans every year.  Summary  There are two types of elephants: African and  Asian. They are known for being the largest land  animals. Elephants are herbivores, which means  they only eat plants. Female elephants live  together in herds, while males live alone.  Elephants are an endangered species.  Questions  What do elephants use their trunks for?  How can you tell an African elephant from an  Asian elephant?  What do you call a baby elephant?  Why are elephants an endangered species?  Glossary  Ivory: A hard creamy-white substance composing the main part of the tusks  of an elephant, walrus, or narwhal.  Example Sentence: Both male and female elephants have ivory tusks.

Probably  at  the  time  her  parents  and  everyone  around  her  assumed  that  she  would  grow  up  to  be  a  mother  and  work  in  the  home.  Little  did  they  know  that  Emmy  would  grow  up  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  mathematicians  of  the  early  20th  century.  Erlangen  University,  where  Emmy’s  Father  worked  4  One  day  when  Emmy  was  a  child,  she  attended  one  of  her  friend’s  birthday  parties  where  her  father  gave  them  logic  puzzles  to  complete  and  Emmy  got  every  one  of  them  right.  From  a  young  age,  everyone  could  see  that  Emmy  was  bright.  Chapter  2  -­‐  Emmy  Goes  to  High  School:  As  a  teenager,  Emmy  took  classes  in  French  and  English  (her  native  language  was  German)  and  prepared  to  be  a  teacher  of  young  girls.  She  was  really  good  at  this  and  went  as  far  as  taking  the  tests  to  qualify  to  teach,  getting  a  score  of  “very  good”.  But  she  realized  that  was  not  really  what  she  wanted  to  do.  What  Emmy  wanted  to  do  was  learn  about  algebra.  This  was  a  bit  of  a  problem  because  Emmy  was  a  girl,  and  this  was  the  1800s.  5  At  this  time,  people  didn’t  think  that  girls  could  do  things  like  math  or  science.  In  early  school  they  would  be  taught  how  to  add,  subtract,  multiply  and  divide,  but  that  was  as  much  as  they  were  expected  to  learn.  While  her  brothers  went  to  high  school  and  were  taught  about  the  mathematical  ideas  that  Emmy  wanted  to  learn,  Emmy  wasn’t  allowed  to  attend.  Luckily,  Emmy  had  a  supportive  family.  Her  father  worked  as  a  professor  of  mathematics  at  the  local  university.  So  Emmy  began  taking  algebra  lessons  from  her  father  who  was  an  excellent  teacher.  Chapter  3  -­‐  Classes  at  University:  Once  Emmy  got  a  little  older  she  wanted  to  continue  her  studies  at  the  university  her  father  worked  at,  Erlangen  6  University.  Remember  how  Emmy  wasn’t  allowed  to  take  high  school  math?  Well  a  girl  taking  college  courses  in  math  was  just  as  weird  to  the  people  of  the  time.  There  was  one  other  woman  attending  at  the  same  time  as  Emmy,  and  neither  of  them  could  officially  take  courses.  They  had  to  “audit”  the  classes  instead,  which  means  sitting  in  on  the  courses  and  learning  everything,  but  not  getting  any  credit  for  it.  She  had  to  also  ask  the  permission  of  the  professors  whose  courses  she  audited.  Even  though  she  hadn’t  officially  taken  any  of  the  classes  she  went  to,  she  studied  hard  this  way  for  two  years  and  then  took  the  final  test  at  Erlangen  and  passed.  7  Chapter  4  –  Becoming  a  Scholar  A  postcard  from  Emmy  at  Göttingen  to  her  family  8  After  passing  her  test  at  Erlangen,  Emmy  applied  to  the  university  Göttingen  to  get  her  doctorate.  This  was  one  of  the  most  famous  mathematics-­‐focused  universities  in  Germany,  with  famous  mathematicians  like  Felix  Klein  and  David  Hilbert  teaching  and  studying  there.  These  were  big  names  in  the  math  world.  Emmy  studied  at  this  famous  place,  impressing  the  famous  mathematicians  who  worked  there  for  one  semester  before  the  university  tightened  its  rules  on  whether  women  were  allowed  to  study  there.  So  Emmy  returned  to  Erlangen  to  finish  her  PhD.  Because  of  her  and  her  father’s  reputation  there  she  was  allowed  to  be  an  actual  student  this  time  instead  of  just  9  auditing  classes  and  she  got  her  doctorate.  Chapter  5  –  Emmy’s  Adulthood  Armed  with  her  new  degree,  Emmy  was  now  equipped  to  teach  math  to  college  students,  except  she  had  one  problem.  She  was  still  a  woman,  and  despite  the  fact  that  mathematicians  who  read  her  work  agreed  it  was  brilliant,  universities  still  would  not  hire  her.  So  she  taught  at  Erlangen  without  pay  for  seven  years.  This  might  be  enough  to  make  a  lot  of  people  quit  doing  math  and  pick  something  else  that  they  could  get  all  the  credit  and  payment  they  deserved  for,  but  Emmy  really  loved  math.  There  was  really  nothing  else  for  her  to  do.  She  kept  studying  on  her  own  while  she  was  teaching,  of  course,  and  kept  writing  too.  10  She  read  the  important  work  of  the  professors  at  Göttingen  like  Dr.  Hilbert,  and  she  wrote  her  own  work  in  response.  Her  work  was  good,  so  the  Göttingen  professors  took  notice.  In  1915,  Dr.  Hilbert  and  Dr.  Klein  tried  to  get  her  a  job  at  Göttingen.  Unfortunately,  it  took  a  vote  from  all  the  professors  at  the  school  to  hire  a  new  professor.  Some  of  the  professors  thought  women  should  not  teach  at  universities.  World  War  One  was  happening  at  the  time  and  one  professor  said,  ""What  will  our  soldiers  think  when  they  return  to  the  university  and  find  that  they  are  required  to  learn  at  the  feet  of  a  woman?""  Hilbert  and  Klein  argued  against  the  other  professors.  If  she  knew  what  she  was  talking  about,  what  did  it  matter  if  she  was  a  woman?  Nevertheless,  the  vote  did  not  pass.  Tragically,  and  suddenly,  Emmy’s  mother  11  died  shortly  after  she  arrived  at  Göttingen.  Emmy  rushed  back  to  Erlangen  to  be  with  her  father  and  attend  the  funeral.  She  stayed  with  her  father  and  helped  him  for  a  few  weeks,  and  then  went  back  to  Göttingen.  Since  she  could  not  become  an  official  member  of  the  faculty,  once  again  Emmy  worked  without  pay.  She  and  her  mentors  had  to  be  clever  to  let  her  teach  at  all.  She  would  schedule  lectures  under  Dr.  Hilbert’s  name  and  officially  she  would  just  be  “helping  out,”  but  really  she  was  the  one  teaching.  She  flourished  while  she  taught  at  Göttingen,  having  around  her  some  of  the  greatest  mathematicians  in  the  world  to  learn  from.  12  Emmy  went  on  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  figures  in  a  field  of  math  called  Abstract  Algebra.  She  helped  change  the  role  of  women  in  math  and  science.  Before  her  time  it  was  easy  for  people  to  say  that  women  had  to  be  bad  at  math.  After  all,  when  had  a  woman  ever  proven  anything  important?  But  she  showed  that  even  when  all  the  schools  were  trying  to  keep  her  from  studying  math,  she  could  still  accomplish  great  things  and  make  it  impossible  for  the  people  around  her  to  deny  her  skill.  If  this  is  what  a  woman  could  do  when  the  world  took  every  effort  to  keep  her  from  doing  it,  what  could  the  women  of  tomorrow  do  with  nobody  in  their  way?  13  Thanks  to  Emmy  it  is  no  longer  unusual  to  have  a  female  math  teacher  or  professor.  You  have  probably  had  one.  You  will  probably  have  more  in  the  future.  And  every  day  female  mathematicians  discover  new  things  and  teach  young  mathematicians.  An  inscription  placed  at  Emmy’s  childhood  home.  It  reads  “Birthplace  of  the  Mathematician”.  14  Chapter  6  –  Emmy’s  Work:  Let’s  talk  a  bit  about  the  math  Emmy  was  working  with.  Emmy  worked  in  a  subject  called  Abstract  Algebra.  You  may  have  taken  an  algebra  class  already.  Abstract  Algebra  is  basically  what  happens  when  you  do  algebra  on  things  that  are  not  necessarily  numbers.  The  basic  idea  behind  algebra  is  that  you  can  talk  about  things  even  if  you  do  not  know  exactly  what  the  thing  you  are  talking  about  is.  Let’s  say  we  have  a  number,  and  we  do  not  know  what  it  is  yet,  but  we  know  that  if  we  add  7  to  it  and  then  subtract  3,  then  we  get  12.  If  we  give  our  mystery  number  a  name,  then  we  can  write  an  equation  15  involving  it.  Let’s  call  the  number  “n”.  (n  +  7)  –  3  =  12  Now,  to  find  out  what  n  is,  all  we  have  to  do  is  notice  that  if  we  subtract  something  and  then  add  the  same  thing,  or  add  something  and  then  subtract  the  same  thing,  then  we  end  up  adding  0,  which  is  the  same  as  doing  nothing.  So  we  can  add  3  to  both  (n  +  7)  –  3  and  to  12  and  get  a  new  equation.  n  +  7  –  3  +  3  =  12  +  3  And  since  subtracting  and  then  adding  the  same  number  is  the  same  as  adding  0,  we  have…  n  +  7  =  0  =  12  +  3  16  Or  just…  n  +  7  =  12  +  3  Then  we  can  subtract  7  from  both  of  them  and  get  n  =  (12  +  3)  –  7  When  we  evaluate  what  this  is,  we  find  that  n  =  8.  So  what  was  the  feature  of  numbers  that  we  used  to  do  that  algebra?  There  are  two  things:  1.  We  have  what  is  called  an  identity.  An  identity  is  something  that  leaves  things  the  way  they  were.  In  this  case  our  identity  was  0.  17  2.  We  have  things  that  “undo”  each  other  and  leave  the  identity  behind.  If  we  subtract  3  and  then  add  3  then  we  end  up  adding  0,  which  does  nothing.  These  objects  are  called  “inverses”.  Now  the  fun  part  comes  in  when  we  realize  that  we  do  not  have  to  be  using  numbers  to  do  this.  Let’s  say  you  have  five  cups  in  front  of  you  labeled  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  5.  You  start  out  with  them  in  a  row  starting  with  cup  1  and  ending  with  cup  5.  But  then  you  start  rearranging  them.  Let’s  say  you  arrange  them  into  the  order  2,  4,  5,  3,  1.  You  can  rearrange  them  back  into  the  beginning  order  by  putting  cup  2  back  in  the  second  position,  4  back  in  the  fourth  position,  etc.  So  we  have  an  inverse  to  this  rearrangement.  18  We  also  have  an  identity,  because  you  could  choose  not  to  move  any  of  the  cups.  Things  that  we  can  do  algebra  on  like  this  are  called  “Groups”.  The  cups  are  an  example  of  an  important  group  called  a  Permutation  Group  with  five  elements.  On  the  next  page  there  are  pictures  of  a  few  more  examples  of  groups.  The  rotations  and  reflections  of  a  snowflake  make  a  group.  19  The  moves  that  we  can  make  on  a  Rubik’s  cube  form  another  group.  If  you  pay  attention,  you  can  find  examples  of  groups  all  over  in  the  world.  Groups  are  one  of  the  simplest  examples  of  algebraic  structures.  The  work  Emmy  did  was  mostly  on  more  complicated  structures  with  more  operations  (like  multiplication).  But  Emmy  spent  her  life  proving  things  about  structures  like  Rubik’s  cubes  and  snowflakes.  20  21  Glossary  Algebra:  The  field  in  math  where  one  learns  how  to  apply  operations,  such  as  addition  and  multiplication,  to  numbers  and  other  objects  without  necessarily  knowing  what  the  objects  are.  We  use  a  variable  like  the  letter  “x”  to  refer  to  an  object  we  do  not  know  about,  or  something  that  could  represent  any  object.  Equation:  A  statement  about  mathematic  objects  involving  an  equals  sign.  For  instance,  5  =  4  +  1  or  8  –  4  =  2  x  2.  For  an  equation  to  be  true,  the  things  on  both  sides  of  the  equal  sign  have  to  be  the  same  thing,  even  if  they  are  written  in  a  different  way.  22  Works  Referenced  Noether  (petite  Image).png.

Emperor penguins are one of the  largest species of penguins. They  are a type  of bird that  does not  fly. These  penguins  are tough  and can  live in cold  climates.  4  What do emperor  penguins look  like?  Emperor penguins are  the tallest penguins. They  are about 4 feet fall. They  have yellow patches  around the neck and  ears. These penguins  have a thick waterproof  fur that covers their  bodies.  5  Emperor penguins weigh  about 50-100 pounds.  Their black and white fur  help hide them from  their predators.  6  Look at all the different  size of penguins!  7  Where do  Emperor  Penguins live?  Emperor penguins live in  Antarctica in the cold  weather. Their fur helps  keep them warm.  8  Did you know that  penguins travel in packs  to help them keep warm?  They take turns being  warm on the inside of  the circle.  9  What Do Emperor  Penguins Eat?  The emperor penguins eat krill,  squid, and other fish. The  penguins dive deep into the sea  to catch their food. They can  stay underwater for 18 minutes!  Their long and narrow beaks  help them hunt for their food.  10  Did you know that  emperor penguins eat  more than any other type  of penguin?  11  Do Emperor  Penguins Lay  Eggs?  The female penguin lays  one egg every winter.  Soon after, the male  penguin takes the egg and  sets it on his feet and  warms it with the body.  12  Male penguins do not eat  for 70 days when they are  taking care of the baby.  Once the egg hatches, the  female penguin returns  home and feeds and cares  for the chick.  13  The mother penguin has a  special pouch for the  chick between her legs.  This keeps the baby  penguin warm because  they do not have their  warm fur coat.  14  A yearly cycle for  penguins!  15  Baby chicks develop a call  so both parents can  recognize them. In just a  few short months, the  penguins head towards  the ocean and the chicks  are ready to hunt on their  own.  16  Fun Facts:  1. Emperor Penguins are only  found in Antarctica.  2. Colonies consist of thousands  of penguins.  3. They can  live up to  about 20  years old  4. Male  penguins  sleep for 20 hours a day when  they are hatching an egg.  5.

Energy is the ability to do work. That means that something can move despite another force acting upon it. The force is often always called gravity.  There are different types of energy. These are called Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy. 4  What is Potential Energy?  Potential Energy is energy that is stored. Energy can be stored in many different ways.   Milk sitting in a carton is stored energy   A ball at the top of a throw is stored energy   Water sitting in a lake is stored energy  5  All of these different types of energy would “do work” if they were released.  6  What is Kinetic Energy?  Kinetic Energy is energy in motion. There are many different examples of energy in motion:   A rollercoaster   A car driving down the street   Moving bodies of water  7  Even though you can’t see electricity and the wind, they are moving! These are two more examples of kinetic energy.  8  Glossary  Energy: The ability to do work.  Potential Energy: Energy that is stored.  Kinetic Energy: Energy in motion.

Pigs like to live in fenced in pens with a little barn or hut.  4  What do pigs eat?  Pigs eat just about anything. They like grain, vegetables, grass, and sometimes meat.  5  Mammals  Pigs are mammals, which means that they give birth to live young and have fur or hair on their bodies. Pigs give birth to litters of piglets. Litters are groups of pigs.  6  Different Breeds  There are different breeds of pigs. Breeds is another word for types of animals within the same species. Pigs can be different colors or look a little different but they are still pigs.  7  How do you take care of pigs?  Pigs need food, water, and shelter, or a place to live in order to survive. In the hot summer weather they need water to sit in to keep them cool. Pigs often rest in a mud hole to keep them cool during the summer months.  8  Cattle  What are cattle?  Cattle are similar animals within a group.  Where do cattle live?  Cattle like to live in large fields where they can eat grass. They also like to have barns to keep them out of cold weather.  9  What do cattle eat?  Cattle need food and water to survive. They eat grass, grain, and vegetables. Cattle need grass to help coat their stomachs before they eat grain. They also use the grass when they chew their cud. Cud is food that returns to the mouth from the stomach for more chewing.  10  Types of Cattle  Cow: A cow is a female cow.  Bull: A bull is a male cow.  Heifer: A heifer is a young female cow.  11  How to take care of cattle?  Cattle need food, water, and shelter just like any other animal. In the summer time they also need a cool shaded area so they do not get overheated.  Cattle also like having trees or posts in their pen so they can use them to scratch their backs.  12  Glossary  Barn: A large farm building used to store grain or hay; also can be used as a house for animals.  Ex: The pigs went to sleep in the barn to stay warm.  Mammal: Warm-blooded animals that give birth to live young.  Ex: Pigs and cattle are both mammals.  Litter: The group of young animals that are born to an animal at one time.  Ex: There were seven piglets in the pigs litter.  Breeds: Animals in a species that have similar qualities to that animal, but may look a little different in appearance.  Ex: There are many different breeds of pigs, however a lot of them look similar. 13  Shelter: A place that protects from bad weather or danger.  Ex: When the snow started to fall the shelter kept the cow warm and dry.  Cud: Food that returns from the stomach to the mouth for more chewing.  Ex: The cow had to chew her cud after she ate.  14  Works Referenced  Cattleman's Beef Board. (2014). Explore Beef - Fact Sheets.

In a natural habitat setting goldfish live in water, particularly calm water. Goldfish prefer water that is thick, muddy, and dense.  Goldfish can also be pets and live in a glass container known as an aquarium. In an aquarium, goldfish require plenty of space to be able to swim. The tank needs soil on the bottom of the tank and nd water temperatures anywhere between 64 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit. 4  Anatomy  Why do you think fins are important in order for goldfish to swim? The body of a goldfish is long and streamlined to help it swim quickly through the water. A goldfish has 5 sets of fins; Dorsal, Caudual, Anal, Pelvic, and the Pectoral. The Dorsal Fin is used for stability and the Caudual Fin is used to assist with forward motion and direction. The Anal Fin helps to keep the goldfish upright. The Pelvic Fins are used for stability and steering. The Pectoral Fins are used for low speeds.  5  Anatomy  You may be wondering how goldfish breathe. Goldfish use their gills to breathe by allowing water to flow out of the mouth and past the gills. Goldfish also have eyes in which they use to see out of just as humans do! Goldfish also have an opening towards the front of their body, known as the mouth. The mouth is used to take in food and water.  6  Anatomy  Believe it or not goldfish also have a nose! This nose is located above its mouth but is not considered to be similar to the nostril of a human. Goldfish are able to smell various odors and chemicals from substances in the water. The nares which are similar to a nose of a human are not connected to the mouth but are lined with sensory patches connected to chamber pouches. The last part of a goldfish is called the Caudual Peduncle and this is considered to be the rear section of the body.  7  Species: Common Goldfish  There are many different types of goldfish but we will be talking about three of them. The first goldfish type is known as the Common Goldfish. This is what you think of when someone says the word goldfish; orange with a smooth tampering body shape. Most varieties of goldfish were derived from this simple breed. This goldfish will thrive in a pond or in an aquarium. This type goldfish isn’t picky in that they will eat pellets, veggies, live food, flakes and fruit. These goldfish may be seen swimming around as red, orange, white, black, chocolate, blue, yellow or lemon. That is a wide range of colors! Have you ever seen the Common Goldfish in any of these colors besides orange?  8  Species: Comet Goldfish  The second goldfish type is called the Comet Goldfish. The Comet Goldfish is one of the most popular goldfish varieties in the United States and was developed in the 1880’s. This goldfish is rather similar to the Common Goldfish but you can distinguish it by its long, single and deeply forked tail fin. Many Comet Goldfish have tails that almost equal the size of their entire body length. The Comet Goldfish will eat the same food as the Common Goldfish. This species of goldfish is one of the most agile goldfish variety. This goldfish can be kept in an aquarium inside or in a pond outside. You may see this goldfish in yellow, red, orange or white!  9  Species: Shubunkin Goldfish  The third goldfish type is known as the Shubunkin Goldfish. This species is a single-tailed goldfish with a pearly appearance from the scales. The Shubunkin’s are known for their different mixed colors of gray, white, blue, red, chocolate, yellow and orange. The Shubunkin will thrive in a large aquarium setting. These goldfish will eat fish flakes, veggies, fruit and live food. So, if you are looking for a multi colored fish, the Shubunkin Goldfish is your pick!  10  Care of a goldfish in an aquarium Tank water temperature should be at about 74 degrees Fahrenheit and the tank should be cleaned weekly. The tank size should be large enough so that the goldfish can swim around and move about freely. Goldfish should be fed pellets, flakes or a mixture of both.  Would you own a goldfish? 11  Glossary  Aquarium- A tank of water in which fish and other water creatures are kept.  Degrees Fahrenheit- The unit of temperature used by most  people in the United States in describing weather.  Dorsal Fin- This fin is used for stability.  Caudual Fin- This fin is used for forward motion and  direction.  Anal Fin- This fin helps to keep the goldfish from flopping  over.  Pelvic Fins- These fins are used for stability and steering. Pectoral Fins- These fins are used when the goldfish swims at low speeds.  Gills- The goldfish uses these in order to breathe.  Eyes- The goldfish uses these to see.  Mouth- This is used to take in food and water.  Nose- The nose of a goldfish is located above its mouth but  isn’t connected and this is used to smell different odors and chemicals in the water.

Common Goldfish- This is the most common type of goldfish and almost all types of goldfish derive from this simple breed. This goldfish is not picky with food and is very easy to take care of in either an aquarium or a pond.  Comet Goldfish- This goldfish is very similar to the Common Goldfish but can be distinguished by its long, single and deeply forked tail that just about equals it in body length.  Shubunkin Goldfish- This goldfish has a pearly appearance from its scales and is known for its unique mixed colors, such as gray, white, blue, red, chocolate, yellow and orange.

His given name was Ehrich  Weisz, and he was one of six children. In 1876  his father moved to the United States where  he got a job as a rabbi. At the age of 8 Ehrich  Weisz moved to Milwaukee with his family.  In his early life Ehrich worked as  newspaper delivery boy and shined shoes to  help support his family. At age 9 he made his  first stage appearance calling himself “Ehrich,  the Prince of the Air” performing a trapeze  act. After this act he and his brother Theo  began to try out magic.  4  This is when Ehrich decided to change his  name, which he chose after a French magician  Robert Houdin, making his stage name Harry  Houdini.  5  Houdini’s Magic Career  His early career started in New York’s  halls and theaters, performing in museums  with his brother Theo. The two brothers were  known as “Brothers Houdini.”  Houdini became known for his escape  artist. His first famous escape trick was called  “Metamorphosis.” In this trick Houdini placed  his assistant into a locked box and then  magically switched behind a curtain.  After these tricks he decided to take a new  step: handcuffs. He became known as the “The  Handcuff King” after completing a trick where  6  his hands are locked in a pair of standard police  handcuffs and was able to escape with nothing  but his own magic hands.  Movie Career  Houdini made his first movie for a French  movie company in 1901. This movie was used  to show Houdini’s famous escapes including  handcuffs and straightjackets. This movie is  what sparked a new interest in the movie  7  industry.  After this film he took a fifteen-year  break, and then in 1916 he made another  appearance in The Mysteries of Myra. In 1918 he  appeared in The Master Mystery, and made a  small appearance in The Grim Game in 1919.  Houdini received the honor of a star on  the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1923 even  though some critics saw his movies as “profits  too meager to continue.”  8  Works Referenced  Corcoran, Kieran.

It  is  used  to  make  bread,  cereal,  noodles,  and  many  other  types  of  food  that  are  made  from  grain.  Farmers  grow  plants  like  wheat  in  their  fields  and  when  harvest  comes  it  is  time  to  cut  the  wheat.  In  the  past  they  had  to  cut  wheat  row  by  row  with  a  scythe.  In  recent  history  and  vast  jumps  in  technology  there  is  now  a  machine  that  cuts  and  cleans  the  grain  for  us  all  by  itself.  4  The  First  Combines  With  the  creation  of  combines  no  longer  did  farmers  have  to  go  through  row  after  row  with  a  scythe  cutting  and  bunching  wheat.  Now,  there  were  two  machines  that  were  both  pulled  by  horses:  a  swather  and  a  thrasher.  The  swather  cuts  all  the  wheat  and  lays  it  in  a  row.  It  has  a  sickle  section,  which  has  multiple  little  triangles  with  blades  on  a  bar.  It  goes  back  and  forth  cutting  the  wheat.  The  thrasher  separates  different  parts  of  the  wheat  and  lays  it  in  a  row.  Then,  the  combine  picks  it  up  and  3  to  4  men  bag  it.  They  then  take  it  to  the  market  or  put  it  on  barges  or  trains.  5  In  the  last  55  years  America  has  made  strides  in  technology  especially  with  combines.  John  Deere  in  particular  had  one  of  the  best  self-­‐propelled  combines.  Combines  that  are  similar  to  the  ones  seen  today  were  able  to  cut  the  wheat  and  thrash  it  as  it  filled  up  in  the  combine.  When  it  was  full,  the  driver  would  wait  for  a  truck  and  would  then  dump  it  as  the  auger  ran  to  unload  the  bulk  tank.  6  This  combine  is  55  years  old  and  was  one  of  the  first  of  its  kind.  During  its  time  it  was  huge  with  a  15-­‐foot  header  and  a  bulk  tank  of  an  amazing  40  bushels  of  wheat.  It  is  no  wonder  why  the  horses  were  retired  from  the  fields!  This  little  machine  doubled  the  productivity  and  shortened  the  length  of  harvest.  7  Harvest  in  the  80s  and  90s  By  the  early  90s  the  combine  you  see  above  had  again  outdone  the  combines  of  the  years  before.  Its  bulk  tank  was  quadruple  the  size  at  120  bushels,  compared  to  the  old  40  bushels.  The  22-­‐  foot  header  seemed  to  dwarf  the  headers  of  the  past  that  were  only  15-­‐foot  headers.  8  Harvest  Today  Combines  have  grown  even  bigger  as  now  the  header  alone  on  a  combine  can  weigh  as  much  as  the  whole  combine  did  55  years  ago.  The  header  has  grown  to  the  average  width  of  35  to  40-­‐feet  long.  This  gives  it  the  ability  to  cut  double  to  triple  the  amount  of  its  ancestors  in  a  single  pass.  Not  to  mention,  the  bulk  tank  on  a  combine  this  big  is  humongous  at  250  bushels.  9  10  With  the  bigger  combines,  the  trucks  and  tractors  on  the  farm  had  to  increase  as  well.  Farm  trucks  have  grown  from  being  600  horsepower  trucks  made  by  Ford  and  GMC  to  changing  into  semi-­‐  trucks  as  the  farms  have  expanded.  These  semi-­‐trucks  can  take  twice  as  many  bushels  as  the  original  grain  trucks  that  had  been  used  before  them.  11  Tractors:  Discs  and  Bank-­out  Wagons  Tractors  have  also  progressed  throughout  the  years.  Although  they  used  to  be  close  relatives  to  army  tanks,  their  tracks  are  no  longer  made  out  of  metal.  Now  they  are  made  of  rubber.  That  is  just  the  start  though.  As  they  have  grown,  so  too  has  their  horsepower  and  now  they  are  able  to  pull  huge  implements.  In  recent  years  engineers  are  focusing  on  auto-­‐steering  for  farmers,  which  allows  them  to  get  the  most  out  of  their  fuel.  A  satellite  takes  control  of  the  steering  wheel  so  that  the  farmer  is  able  to  make  a  phone  call  or  eat  his  lunch  as  the  tractor  drives  in  a  straight  line  through  the  field.  12  During  harvest,  the  tractors  pull  a  disc  or  a  bank-­‐out  wagon.  The  disc  is  in  case  of  fires,  since  an  implement  that  has  a  disc  2-­‐feet  in  diameter  cuts  through  the  dirt  and  flips  it  on  top  of  the  straw.  This  muffles  the  fuel  source  for  the  fire  as  each  disc  is  placed  less  than  a  foot  away  from  the  next.  13  The  bank-­‐out  wagon  has  risen  to  popularity  in  the  last  few  years  as  farmers  use  it  to  save  time.  It  is  a  giant  bulk  tank  for  the  combines  to  dump  into  as  the  tractor  pulls  the  wagon  over  to  the  trucks.  Then  the  farmer  fills  them  up  and  then  hauls  them  to  an  elevator.  14  Glossary  Scythe:  a  tool  used  for  cutting  crops  such  as  grass  or  wheat,  with  a  long  curved  blade  at  the  end  of  a  long  pole  attached  to  which  are  one  or  two  short  handles.  Swather:  a  harvesting  machine  that  cuts  and  windrows  grain  and  seed  crops  Sickle  Sections:  metal  triangles  that  are  attached  to  a  bar  on  one  side  as  the  other  two  sides  are  serrated.  Thrasher:  a  farm  machine  for  separating  seeds  or  grain  from  the  husks  and  straw.  Bulk  Tank:  a  large,  often  metallic  container  for  holding  or  storing  grain.  Auger:  a  shaft  that  acts  as  a  conveyor  to  the  bulk  tank  that  it  is  attached  to.  Implements:  A  broad  term  used  to  refer  to  types  of  equipment  that  serve  a  unique  purpose  and  can  be  pulled  behind  a  tractor  or  truck.  Bushel:  60  lbs.  of  wheat.  15  Works  Referenced  ""Share  your  projects  and  ideas""  by  Vital  Signs  available  under  a  Creative  Commons  Attribution  (CC-­‐BY)  3.0  License  “Comcast  protest”  by  Flikr  user  Steve  Rhodes  used  under  Creative  Commons  Attribution  2.0  license  Scott,  Brian.

Color:  Honeybees can be a couple of different colors.  Most honeybees are golden yellow with black  bands around their bodies. Other honeybees  are light brown. There is a reason honeybees  are usually so bright. Their bright colors warn  predators that they can sting.  Size:  Worker bees are usually females, and they  range from 9 to 18mm long. A queen bee can  range from 18 to 20mm in length. They are  usually the size of a paperclip!  Can you name the different parts of the  honeybee?  5  Types of Bees  Honeybees live in a hive. The members of the  hive are split into three different groups that  have different jobs: the queen, workers, and  drones.  Queen: She runs the whole hive. Her job is to  lay eggs for the hive.  Workers: They are the female bees and their  job is to get food for the hive and protect it.  Drones: These are the male bees of the hive.  Their job is to mate with the queen bee.  6  Habitat  Honeybees live all over the world. Most prefer  to live in meadows with flowers and  woodlands. Within their habitat they build  hives or nests inside tree holes and in other  places they can safely hide.  Would this be a good place for a honeybee to  make its hive?  7  Communication  Honeybees cannot talk like we can, so they  have to communicate through dancing. The  main reason they communicate is to tell the  other bees where food is. The two dances they  use to communicate are called the round  dance and the waggle dance.  Round Dance: This dance is used for finding  the food source 25-100 meters away from the  hive. This dance does not show direction.  Waggle Dance: This dance shows direction  of the food source and the energy that is  required to find the food.  8  Can you imitate the different dances the bees  do?  9  Crops Pollinated by Honeybees in the  United States  10  Interesting Facts  • Honeybees never sleep!  • The queen bee can lay 1,500 eggs a day.  • Honeybees are the only insects that can  produce food for humans.  • Honeybees have five eyes.  • Honeybees are the only bees that die after  they sting.  11  Questions and Answers  Q: How do honeybees communicate?  A: They communicate through dances. The  two dances are round dance and waggle dance.  Q: What type of honeybee lays all of the eggs?  A: The queen bee lays all of the eggs.  Q: What do honeybees live in?  A: They live in a hive.  12  Glossary  Predators: Animals that live by eating other  animals.  Communicate: When someone or something  shows their thoughts and feelings.  Produce: To make something.  Imitate: To do the same thing as someone or  something.  13  Works Referenced  • Megony, Kelly L. ""Fun Facts about Honey Bees."" Fun Facts  about Honey Bees.

Then  check  to  make  sure  your  pilot  chute  catches  air  when  dropped.  4  Finally,  make  sure  your  slider  is  fully  opened.  Doing  all  of  this  now  will  make  the  process  quicker  later  on!  5  Set  Breaks  Thread  they  yellow  toggle  through  the  eyelet  in  the  white  line.  6  Then  set  the  top  and  bottom  ends  of  the  toggles  in  their  respective  sleeves.  This  will  ensure  that  when  the  parachute  opens  it  does  so  evenly  and  in  half  breaks  for  stability.  7  Lines  Separate  your  lines  in  your  fingers.  There  should  be  two  main  sets  in  each  hand,  plus  a  single  break  line.  Keep  tension  on  your  lines  as  you  walk  and  extend  them  down  to  the  canopy.  8  Once  you  are  sure  there  are  no  tangles,  combine  your  lines  so  that  you  are  holding  them  in  place  over  your  shoulder.  9  Nose  The  nose  is  the  front  of  the  parachute.  This  is  where  air  enters  the  wing  through  openings  called  cells.  The  air  pressure  creates  a  rigid  air  foil,  similar  to  the  wing  of  an  airplane.  10  The  nose  needs  to  be  organized  and  put  into  one  place,  nearest  your  body.  Count  the  cells  (9  of  them)  and  tuck  them  in  between  your  legs.  11  Flake  Separate  your  4  line  sets.  Front  left,  rear  left,  front  right,  and  rear  right.  Then  begin  flaking  the  nylon  fabric  layer  upon  layer  according  to  the  line  set  that  each  fold  is  associated  with.  12  The  parachute  is  actually  backwards  at  this  stage  so  you  are  working  backwards  from  the  tail  towards  the  nose.  13  Slider/Tail  Now  that  your  lines  are  layered  properly,  it  is  time  to  keep  them  that  way.  By  pushing  the  slider  down  and  quartering  it  between  the  four  line  groups,  you  will  keep  your  lines  tight  and  organized.  14  Once  you  have  the  slider  in  place,  reach  down  and  pull  the  tail  up  over  the  whole  thing  like  an  outer  shell.  Then  roll  it  closed.  15  S-­‐Folds  Lay  the  canopy  on  the  floor.  Kneel  on  it  and  squeeze  it  into  a  burrito  shape.  16  Then  fold  it  into  an  S-­‐shape  as  you  place  it  into  the  Deployment  Bag.  17  Line  Stows  Create  an  even  loop  of  white  line  and  use  a  rubber  band  to  hold  it  in  place.  Repeat  this  on  both  sides  until  there  is  only  about  a  foot  of  loose  line  left.  18  Container  Place  deployment  bag  and  lines  in  the  opening  of  the  container.  Close  the  four  flaps  and  lock  them  in  place  with  the  closing  pin.  19  Pilot  Chute  Lay  your  pilot  chute  out  on  floor.  Fold  it  and  roll  it  into  a  compact  tube  shape  Slide  it  into  the  neoprene  sleeve  at  the  bottom  of  the  container.  Leave  the  hacky  handle  out  so  that  you  can  deploy  your  parachute.  20  Check  List  Step  Yes  No  Prep  Work  Breaks  Lines  Nose  Flake  Slider  Tail  S-­‐Folds  D-­‐Bag  Line  Stows  Container  Pilot  Chute  21  Glossary  Canopy:  The  nylon  fabric  that  makes  up  the  parachute.

Idaho’s  Fur  Trappers  were  a  group  of  men  who  came  west  to  trap  beavers  to  send  back  to  the  people  living  in  the  eastern  United  States.  Many  of  the  fur  trappers  were  people  who  did  not  fit  in  with  city  life  in  the  east.  Some  of  the  fur  trappers  were  young  men  looking  to  ‘make  it  big’  while  others  were  old  men  looking  to  get  away  from  the  busy  cities  and  return  to  nature.  A  few  were  even  outlaws  looking  to  hide  from  the  law  on  the  edges  of  the  world.  Fur  trapping  was  always  part  of  the  American  Frontier  because  the  population  of  fur  animals  dwindled  quickly  after  the  frontier  was  tamed.  Most  men  who  came  west  as  fur  trappers  did  not  have  wives.  Rarely  the  trappers  would  take  a  Native  woman  to  marry  as  their  wives,  but  this  was  not  common.  Late  1800s  fur  trader  Reflection  Question:  Why  do  you  think  that  the  fur  traders  had  to  keep  coming  further  west?  4  When did the Fur Trappers live?  The  fur  trapping  has  been  part  of  life  in  America  since  before  the  American  Revolution.  French  fur  trappers  had  been  working  in  the  North  East  since  before  the  first  British  colonies  were  founded.  However,  the  Fur  Tappers  did  not  come  to  Idaho  in  large  numbers  until  after  the  Lewis  and  Clark  expedition.  The  expedition  ended  in  1806  but  it  took  some  time  for  the  fur  Trappers  to  come  west.  Lewis  and  Clark,  however,  paved  the  path  west  for  the  fur  trappers  to  follow.  The  fur  trade  kicked  off  after  the  War  of  1812.  The  Rocky  Mountain  Fur  Trading  Company  was  founded  in  1822  and  controlled  much  of  the  fur  trade  until  1834  when  the  company  went  bankrupt.  The  fur  trade  continued  well  into  the  1840s  and  1850s.  However,  the  declining  beaver  population  meant  that  by  1845  large  scale  trapping  was  over.  William  Clark  and  Merriweather  Lewis  Reflection  Question:  Why  did  it  take  so  long  for  the  fur  trappers  to  come  to  the  Rocky  Mountains?  5  Where did the Fur Trappers live?  The  Idaho  fur  trappers  lived  all  over  the  state  of  Idaho.  However,  they  were  mainly  centered  in  the  Columbia  drainage  basin.  This  means  that  there  were  fur  trappers  living  all  over  the  state  of  Idaho  with  the  exception  of  far  southeastern  Idaho.  Many  of  the  trappers  were  concentrated  in  the  panhandle  of  the  state.  They  preferred  to  live  in  northern  Idaho  because  there  was  a  greater  concentration  of  fur  animals  that  lived  there.  6  What did they wear?  They  did  not  dress  like  the  people  living  in  the  city  and  they  did  not  really  dress  like  the  Native  Americans.  They  had  a  style  of  dress  that  was  a  style  all  their  own.  Many  of  the  fur  trappers  dressed  in  buckskins  and  furs.  However,  they  did  not  usually  start  trapping  dressed  like  that.  Many  fur  trappers  came  as  they  were  with  the  clothes  that  they  used  for  their  past  jobs.  As  things  wore  out  the  trappers  would  replace  them  with  what  they  could  find.  It  was  also  common  for  the  trappers  to  trade  with  the  local  Native  Americans  for  many  things  including  clothes.  By  the  time  a  fur  trapper  was  ready  to  retire  he  could  have  gathered  quite  the  assortment  of  clothing.  Every  fur  trapper  had  their  own  style  and  dressed  a  little  bit  differently.  Some  adopted  the  dress  of  the  local  Native  Americans  while  others  simply  wore  whatever  they  had  to  wear.  7  Hats  A  hat  was  something  that  every  good  fur  trapper  had.  These  were  as  varied  as  the  fur  trapper’s  clothes.  Many  trappers  wore  fur  hats  made  from  the  local  fur  animals  that  they  hunted.  Some  of  the  trappers  even  bought  back  the  beaver  felt  hats  that  were  made  from  the  beaver  pelts  they  traded.  Wool  was  another  common  material  that  was  used  for  hats,  but  wool  also  had  to  be  shipped  all  the  way  from  the  East.  This  meant  that  wool  was  often  too  expensive  for  most  mountain  men.  One  of  many  styles  of  hat  common  to  the  fur  trappers.  8  What did they have in their pockets?  While  it  may  seem  silly  to  us  today,  the  fur  trappers  did  not  have  pockets.  This  was  because  pockets  are  hard  to  sew  on  to  clothes  without  a  sewing  machine.  Instead,  the  fur  trappers  carried  around  a  large  bag  that  was  usually  made  of  leather.  This  bag  was  called  a  possibles  bag.  This  bag  was  similar  in  size  and  shape  to  a  modern  purse.  However,  I  would  not  want  to  tell  a  fur  trapper  that  he  was  carrying  a  purse!  The  style  of  possibles  bags  varied  greatly,  but  they  all  contained  one  large  pocket.  Some  fancy  ones  even  had  pouches  for  storing  more  things  and  were  elaborately  decorated.  9  So  what  did  they  carry  in  their  possibles  bag?  They  carried  everything  that  they  might  need  to  do  their  job.  They  would  carry  things  to  build  a  fire,  as  well  as  all  of  the  tools  that  they  needed  to  maintain  their  rifles  and  traps.  They  would  also  carry  their  food  for  the  day  and  a  container  for  carrying  water.  Often  they  would  carry  a  powder  horn  or  a  powder  flask  on  the  outside  of  their  possibles  bag  to  carry  the  black  powder  for  their  rifle.  Most  fur  trappers  also  carried  anything  valuable  with  them  in  the  possibles  bag  so  that  they  did  not  leave  it  at  camp.  Powderhorn.  Reflection  Question:  What  valuable  things  would  you  keep  in  your  possibles  bag  if  you  were  a  fur  trapper?  10  What tools did they use?  Traps  Almost  all  of  the  fur  trappers  used  the  same  kind  of  traps  to  catch  their  beavers.  They  were  all  based  on  a  jaw  style  trap.  This  also  happens  to  be  the  same  kind  of  animal  trap  that  most  people  think  of.  These  traps  worked  by  closing  around  the  beaver’s  foot  and  holding  it  under  water  until  the  beaver  drowned.  These  traps  also  caught  a  number  of  unintended  animals.  Long  Guns  Every  trapper  also  carried  a  flintlock  or  cap  lock  rifle  or  a  musket  both  of  which  shot  lead  round  balls.  The  difference  between  the  two  are  few,  but  important.  A  musket  has  a  smooth  barrel  that  directs  the  ball  toward  a  target.  While  a  rifle  has  groves  in  its  barrel  that  twist  the  ball  as  it  leaves  the  gun.  The  advantage  of  the  rifle  was  that  it  could  be  shot  at  a  longer  range  than  the  musket.  However,  the  musket  had  the  advantage  of  being  able  to  fire  small  pellets  called  shot.  This  allowed  the  musket  to  be  used  to  hunt  both  large  animals  like  deer  and  elk  and  small  animals  like  rabbits  and  squirrels.  Top:  Cap  Lock  Rifle,  Bottom:  Flint  Lock  Rifle  11  Pistols  Nearly  every  trapper  also  carried  a  pistol  of  some  kind.  These  were  almost  always  single  shot  and  normally  used  the  same  round  balls  as  their  rifle.  The  pistol  was  used  as  a  backup  for  the  rifle  and  was  carried  on  a  belt  around  the  fur  trapper’s  waist.  Revolving  pistols  came  into  existence  toward  the  end  of  the  Rocky  Mountain  fur  trade  era.  However,  they  were  expensive  and  prone  to  breaking  so  it  is  unlikely  that  many  fur  trappers  used  them.  Tomahawks  The  tomahawk  was  one  of  the  most  important  tools  in  a  fur  trapper’s  accompaniments  or  possessions.  It  served  a  double  purpose  as  a  camp  tool,  and  a  last  ditch  weapon.  The  first  settlers  who  came  to  the  new  world  brought  tomahawks  with  them,  but  they  found  that  the  people  living  here  also  had  tomahawks  of  their  own.  12  What did their  houses look like?  Most  fur  trappers  did  not  live  in  a  house.  Instead,  they  lived  in  canvas  shelters.  These  shelters  came  in  a  variety  of  forms.  They  can  be  grouped  into  two  different  categories.  The  first  category  of  shelters  resemble  a  Tipi.  These  are  free  standing  shelters  that  provided  good  year-­‐round  protection  from  the  environment.  This  shelter  was  borrowed  from  the  Native  Americans  of  the  Great  Plaines  and  the  Rocky  Mountains.  The  second  type  of  shelter  is  called  a  lean-­‐to.  It  is  simply  a  piece  of  canvas  that  makes  a  roof  over  a  small  area.  These  were  not  well  suited  for  the  winter.  Many  trappers  who  used  this  style  of  shelter  moved  into  warmer  regions  during  the  cold  months.  13  Review Questions  How do you think the Native  Americans might have viewed the fur  trappers? Do you think it was  positively or negatively?  If you were a fur trapper what  kind of things might you carry in  your possibles bag and why?  What do you think the fur  trappers could have done differently  to prevent the near extinction of the  beaver population in the Rocky  Mountains?  14  Works Referenced  Information  Davidson,  J.

Labrador Retrievers got their name from their first job. Their first job was to retrieve fish on the shores of Newfoundland for their owners.  Labrador Retrievers make very good family dogs and they love kids the most. They live to please their owners and love to make them happy.  They love to play and are very athletic dogs.  They are the most popular breed in the United States. 4  History  Labrador Retriever’s were originally called “St. John’s” because they were first found in St. John which is the capital of  Newfoundland in the early  1700’s.  While in Newfoundland, labs spent their days retrieving fist off the shores. In 1880 labs almost become extinct because the government created laws and raised the taxes.  In the 1920s labs came to the United States. The breed became popular after World War II and in the 1920s. 5  Appearance  Labs are large dogs. Their coats are short and very thick. Their coats are also water resistant. This helps them stay warm in cold water and cold  weather. They have  webbed feet as well that help them swim  just like ducks do.  The females and males look a little bit different.  This is what webbed feet look like.  Males  Females  Pounds  65-80  55-70  Height (inches tall)  22.5-24.5  21.5-23.5  These numbers above are just averages. Labs can be smaller or bigger than this. 6  Temperament  Labs are very kind dogs. They are great to be around. They are outgoing and love to have fun. They make great family dogs.  They have a very strong sense of smell that helps them with their daily tasks and their jobs.  They are known for their gentle mouths. Labs do a thing called soft mouth. They can even carry an egg in their mouth without breaking it!  It is known that females can be more independent than males. 7  Colors of Labs  There are three original colors of labs. That is black, yellow and chocolate (brown). They are others as well that a mix of the colors like red, white and charcoal. 8  Types of Labs  There are two types of labs. There are American (left blow) labs which are known for work dogs. Then there are English (right below) labs which are known for show dogs.  English labs are calmer tempered than American dogs. That is why American are used for working and English are used for shows.  9  Types of Labs  You can see the difference between American and English labs below.  American  English  Body  Big, stocky, block like, long chest, very solid,  short bodies from head to tail, runs slower  Skinny body, short chest, long bodies from  head to tail, runs faster  Head  Wide, top of head looks like  square, thicker face, short  muzzle  Skinny head, top of head looks  round, long  muzzle  Neck  Short, thick  Long, skinny  Tail  Thick, straight  Skinny, curls towards the end  Legs  Short  Long  Coat  Thick coat  Thin coat 10  Jobs of Labs  Labs are very smart and have very good noses so they are used for a lot of jobs.  Labs are used for hunting: they flush, point, and retrieve.  Flushing  11  Jobs of Labs  Labs are also used for tracking. When they track they use their nose to find whatever they are trained to find. Some are trained to find hurt people in earth quakes, hurricanes or even a burning house. They are also trained to find bombs or explosives to help keep people safe.  Disabled assistance is another job of labs. They do a lot from helping blind people get around and keeping them safe. Or they help cart people around who cannot walk or need help walking.  12  They also make great therapy dogs. They go into hospitals, retirement homes, nursing homes, and school to help adults and kids to feel better and safe.  Labs also make great friends and buddies for police officers. They stick by the police officers side and keep them safe from any danger. The police officer and its lab go through a lot of training together so they gain a lot of trust with one another.  13  Labs in War  Labs that were in the Vietnam War were the only dogs classified as “military working dogs”. There were 4,000 labs that helped in the Vietnam War. They helped the soldiers find where the enemies and dangers were. They helped find soldiers that were hurt and needed help. Mostly importantly they helped keep the soldiers safe.  14  Play Time  Labradors love to play. They need 30-60 minutes of exercise a day in order to stay healthy. If they do not get the exercise that they need they may become bored and chew things up.  Labs live to train and please their owners. There is a lot of training you can do with a lab. You can teach them to sit, lie down, roll over, and shake and so much more.  One of labs favorite things to do is play fetch. They also love to play with other dogs. 15  Glossary  Retrieve: to get or bring something  Newfoundland: large Canadian island off the east coast of the North American mainland  Coat: fur or hair covering an animal’s body  Water resistant: able to keep water off to a certain amount  Webbed feet: skin that connects between toes  Soft mouth: behavior that means to pick up, hold and carry very gently  Stocky: thick and heavy built Muzzle: 16  Flush: to find the game being hunted then running into the hiding place making them available for the hunter to shoot  Point: stopping and aiming its muzzle towards the game being looked for  Tracking: following a course or trail to an item or destination  Disabled assistance: those who need help physically, mentally or emotionally  Vietnam War: a war from 19-55-1975 that was fought by the United States against the Vietnamese 17  Questions  Question: Are labradors good swimmers?

The President decided the territory needed to be explored. Thomas Jefferson hired Meriwether Lewis to be the captain of the Corps of Discovery expedition. The purpose of the expedition was to find a water route that linked the Columbia River to the Missouri River. Meriwether Lewis chose his friend William Clark to co-command the expedition. The explorers met many Native American tribes including the Shoshone, Mandan, Hidatsas, and many more. Lewis and Clark made maps and wrote about the plants and animals they found along the way. The expedition took about two years to complete.  3 Meriwether Lewis  Meriwether Lewis was born on August 18, 1774 in Virginia. President Thomas Jefferson asked Meriwether Lewis to be his personal secretary in 1801. He was also an explorer and a soldier. He met William Clark while serving in the military with him in 1795. When Meriwether Lewis returned home from the journey he was named the governor of the Louisiana Territory.  4 William Clark  William Clark was born on August 1, 1770 in Virginia. William Clark was an explorer and a soldier, which is similar to Meriwether Lewis. William Clark received a letter from Meriwether Lewis in 1803 asking him to share the command of an expedition. Meriwether Lewis made William Clark his co- commanding caption but the government did not recognize it.  5 Map of the Journey  The Journey  The expedition began on May 14, 1804 at Camp Wood in Ohio. They built Fort Mandan across the river from the main village of the Mandan and Hidatsas Native Americans. They stayed in Fort Mandan for the winter of 1804. Then they came to a fork in the river. Lewis and Clark believed the south fork was the Missouri river but the other men on the expedition thought it was the north fork. They followed the south fork and reached the three forks of the Missouri river in Montana. They continued southwest and reached the Columbia River on October 16, 1805.  6 Sacagawea  Sacagawea was a Shoshone Native American. She was married to Touissant Charbonneau, who was a French-Canadian trader. They were invited on Lewis and Clark’s expedition during their first winter. Sacagawea’s husband was an interpreter for the two explorers. They needed Sacagawea’s help to find the Shoshones because the Shoshones were believed to live at the headwaters of the Missouri River.  7 1770  1774  Timeline  August 1 – William Clark was born. August 18 – Meriwether Lewis was born.  1801  1803  March 6– President Jefferson asked Lewis to be his secretary.  Spring– President Jefferson asked Lewis to be the commander of the expedition. Lewis asked Clark to be the co-­‐commander. Clark accepts.  July 4 – President Jefferson announces the Louisiana Purchase.  Fall/Winter – Camp Wood is established.  1804 May 14 – The expedition begins.  November 4 – Sacagawea and her husband were hired on to the expedition.

October 11 – Lewis dies.  December 20 – Sacagawea dies. 8  September 1 – Clark dies. Journals  Lewis and Clark both wrote detailed journal entries about the expedition. They wrote about the different plants and animals they had seen and also the different types of weather they experienced. These journals have given us insight on the expedition from the point of view of Lewis and Clark.  An entry from Meriwether Lewis-  May 20, 1804  “We set forward… to join my friend companion and fellow labourer Capt. William Clark, who had previously arrived at that place with the party destined for the discovery of the interior of the continent of North America… As I had determined to reach St. Charles this evening and knowing that there was now no time to be lost I set forward in the rain… and joined Capt. Clark, found the party in good health and sperits.”  9 Example of a Journal Entry  10 Outcomes  There were many outcomes of the expedition. The first one was diplomatic relations with Native Americans. Lewis and Clark traded goods and created useful relationships. William Clark drew detailed maps that named and noted rivers, creeks, significant points in the landscape, and where the explorers camped. They also found a water route that linked the Columbia and the Missouri rivers. Meriwether Lewis was named the governor of the Louisiana Territory and William Clark was appointed as the agent for Indian Affairs in the west. He later became he governor of the Missouri Territory.  11 Questions  Compare and contrast Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.  Describe the purpose of the expedition.  Discuss Sacagawea and her family’s important role in the expedition.  What outcome was most useful for William Clark for his future career?  12 Glossary  Diplomatic Relations: To conduct relationships between governments peacefully.

Ailey’s early life came with many  hardships, which shaped the artist  he grew up to be.  4  Ailey had to pick cotton with his  mother while the white children  would go to school. He also  experienced his mother being  raped by a white man. These  horrific events in his life translate  through Ailey’s art.  5  Dancing Career  Many other dancers’ specific  movements and aesthetics  influenced Alvin Ailey. Doris  Humphrey, Martha Graham, Charles  Weidman, and Lester Horton  influenced Ailey’s movements. Ailey  trained and danced for four years  with Lester Horton.  6  After Lester Horton passed away  Ailey had to move on, so he went to  New York. With Horton’s death and  Ailey having to move on, he was  able to branch out and fulfill his  vision.  7  Diversity Impact & Legacy  Ailey envisioned having a company  that would breakdown racial  barriers, and that is just what he  did. Alvin Ailey was able to create  his own group, Alvin Ailey American  Dance Theater, which was formed in  1958. Ailey was huge in modern  dance and was able to help break  racial barriers. Many of Ailey’s works  8  had to do with the social theme of  race. One of his most famous works  is Revelations, which tells the story  of many African Americans’  struggle. Revelations, as well as his  other creations, had a religious  focus that was able to sustain  generations of slaves. Ailey also  made sure to utilize choral spirituals  and rhythmic instrumentation.  9  10  Works Referenced  “Alvin Ailey” by Wikipedia contributors, available under  text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike  3.0 License.

He  is part of the second generation  of modern dance.  Jose Limon had some exposure to  students of Denishawn. Even with  experience with Denishawn,  Limon moved to New York City  and started to train with Doris  4  Humphrey and Charles Weidman  at the age of 24.  5  Impacts & Influences  Limon has the influence of going to  war for a few years. Limon served  in World War I for 3 years and  returned to civilian life. His more  socially focused dances are affected  by this time in his life.  Doris Humphrey’s style: natural,  organic movement. Dramatized  relationship with gravity and  rhythm of breathing was a  6  technique Humphrey utilized and  passed on to Limon.  Being a man in the dance world,  Limon was eager to support male  dancers and their journey to  become equal to women in the  dance world.  7  Works & Accomplishments  Limon Dance Company was  founded in 1946, and Doris  Humphrey was the company’s  artistic director.  The Moor’s Pavane was one of  Limon’s famous works and was  choreographed in 1949. This work  of his was based on Shakespeare's  tragedy “Othello”.  8  Limon was asked to represent  the United States as a cultural  ambassador because he had such a  unique background.  Limon was interested in “the  arts’ transcendent ability to touch  basic human sensibilities, without  abandoning theatrical values.”  Limon died in 1972 from cancer,  but his legacy and company still  remain today.  9  Works Referenced  “Jose Limon” by Wikipedia contributors available under  text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike  3.0 License.

It was suggested by Idaho school children to be considered as the state bird. This bluebird gets its name because it lives in the mountains of Western North America. For most of the year, this Mountain Bluebird will remain in the northern areas of Idaho. When the seasons change to winter, the Mountain Bluebird will fly south to live in southern California and northern Mexico to enjoy the warm weather!  http://barnowlbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Blue-Bird-Map.jpg 4  Identification  Mountain Bluebirds are fairly small thrush songbirds,  typically having round heads and straight, thin bills. Compared with other bluebirds they are lanky and long- winged, with a long tail. You can identify the difference between a male and female Mountain Bluebird by their coloring. A male Mountain Bluebird is blue and will  have a white underside. A female Mountain Bluebird is brown and will have pale blue wings and tail. Mountain Bluebirds’ bills are entirely black. Juveniles have fewer spots than the young of other bluebirds.  Featured image: Mountain bluebird.

Mountain Bluebirds will hover low over the grass in open fields and search for food. When they have sighted their insect prey, they will pounce from an elevated perch. In the winter, the Mountain Bluebird will fly in large flocks as they wander around feasting on berries, particularly those of junipers, which is a shrub.  Photo and caption by Katherine Davis  http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/photo-contest/2012/entries/181229/view/ 6  Habitat  Mountain Bluebirds most commonly live in varied, open  terrain, like the West’s wide-open spaces, particularly at middle and higher elevations. They breed in natural habitats such as prairie, sagebrush steppe which is a large area of flat unforested land, and alpine tundra which is flat, treeless, and frozen land. Mountain Bluebirds will often find nesting in bluebird boxes and hunting in pastures.  Photo and caption by Steve Rothenberg http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/traveler-magazine/photo- contest/2012/entries/140757/view/ 7  Nesting  During nesting times, the male Mountain Bluebirds will sometimes enact a kind of symbolic nest-building whether it’s acting as if they are bringing nesting material to the cavity (actually carrying nothing) or dropping their burdens along the way. On the other hand, a female will work hard in the early morning building an insulated nest all by herself. The entire process of building a nest can take several days to more than a week. Mountain Bluebirds often reuse nest cavities within and between breeding seasons.  http://www.peeniewallie.com/2008/06/ Rob Kiser 8  Species of Thrush Found in North America  American Robin  Varied Thrush  Rufous-backed Robin  Veery  Clay-colored Thrush  Eastern Bluebird  Townsend’s Solitaire  Bicknell’s Thrush  Swainson’s Thrush  Hermit Thrush  White-Throated Thrush  Western Bluebird  Mountain Bluebird  Redwing  Gray-cheeked Thrush  9  Wood Thrush  Aztec Thrush 9  Media Attributions  Media acknowledgments can be found underneath each photo.

The Olympic National Park is very diverse.  It includes three different ecosystems:  mountains, pacific coast, and temperate rain  forest.  4  Hoh Rainforest  The Hoh Rainforest is a part of the Olympic  National Park. It is a temperate rainforest.  The canopy is lush and green due to all of  the rain the area gets. The Hoh Rainforest is  covered in a layer of mosses and ferns as well.  5  Pacific Coast  Beautiful sunsets can be seen on the  coastlines of the Pacific Ocean when visiting  the Olympic National Park.  Grey whales can be seen spouting in the  water. Seals, sea lions, and sea otters are also  often swimming in the Pacific Ocean or  resting on the beaches.  6  Olympic Mountains  Mount Olympus is the highest peak in the  Olympic Mountain Range, reaching 7,980 feet  at the summit.  Hurricane Ridge is a great lookout point to  view the Olympic Mountains.  7  Weather  Temperate rainforests have mild weather, so  it is never extremely cold or extremely hot  How much does it rain in temperate  rainforests?  In the Hoh Rainforest, the average rainfall  per year is 140 to 170 inches, which is 12 to  14 feet!  8  Diversity  How is there so much diversity in the  Olympic National Park?  Since there are high mountain peaks and  low-lying rivers, there are many changes in  elevation. Different elevations get different  amounts of rainfall, causing many different  habitats to form.  9  There are a wide variety of plants and animals  in the Olympic National Park. Over 1,450  different types of plants grow in the park.  Also, hundreds of species of mosses can be  found throughout the park. There is even a  hiking trail in the park called the Hall of  Mosses where you can find some of the  different kinds!  10  Elwha River Restoration  The Elwha River flows through the Olympic  National Park. A large dam used to block the  river’s natural state, but in 2011 the process  began to remove the dam.  It was the largest dam removal in US History.  11  The Elwha River restoration process had  many necessary steps in order to return the  river flow to its original channel.  This table shows some of the fish found in  the Elwha River and how they were affected  by the removal of the dam. The ability for the  fish to spawn was greatly improved once the  dam was removed, increasing fish  populations in the Elwha River.

In order to preserve its natural state, it has  been named a World Heritage Site and an  International Biosphere Reserve.  How many world heritage sites are there?  There are 1031 World Heritage sites in the  world.  13  Glossary  Canopy: Upper layer of a forest formed by  the tops of trees.  Dam: A barrier blocking the flow of water.

They are:  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.  4  Mercury  Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It is also the smallest of the eight planets. The surface looks a lot like the Moon because it is covered in craters.  5  Venus  Venus is the hottest of the eight planets. It is way hotter than an oven. Venus is almost the same size as Earth.  6  Earth  This is the planet that we live on. Earth has a moon that lights up our sky at night. Earth also has volcanoes and oceans on it.  7  Mars  Mars has old volcanoes that are taller than the mountains on Earth. There are old rivers on the surface that do not have water in them anymore.  8  Jupiter  Jupiter is much larger than Earth.  It has four moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.  9  Saturn  Saturn has rings that circle the planet. The rings are made of ice and rock.  10  Uranus  Uranus is blue-green in color. It is tilted on its side, unlike the rest of the planets.  11  Neptune  Neptune is very blue. It has a few moons but its biggest moon is named Triton.  12  Summary  The planets that you have just seen are in the exact order from the Sun. Below is a picture of the order of the planets.  13  Questions  What is the smallest planet in our solar system?  How many moons does Jupiter have?  What are Saturn’s rings made of?  14  Glossary  Solar System: This is the eight planets and their moons orbiting around the Sun.  Tilted: This means that it is tipped or it leans on its side.

Recycling is the process of making new products from a product that has already been used. If you drink a can of soda and throw it away it may end up in a landfill, where pollution to our air takes place. Instead, if you recycle this empty can, it goes through the process of recycling where eventually it will be able to be used again rather than going to the landfill! You can recycle a lot of different things like paper, metal, plastic and glass  products. You recycle by  How many  things do you  think you could recycle over a week?  discarding your used recyclables into recycle bins instead of trash cans. 4  Why We Recycle  The trash we throw away every day has a huge effect on our environment.  Recycling is a way to help reduce pollution that causes harmful chemicals to get into the earth’s atmosphere. By doing our part, we can help our planet be a healthier place to live! 5  Why we recycle   According to NASA, if you throw away a plastic bottle today it will stay in a landfill for thousands of years. Americans use 2,500,000 plastic bottles an hour!   “If we recycled all our aluminum cans for one year, we could save enough energy to light Washington, D.C. for 3.7 years.” – NASA The population of Washington D.C is approximately 646,500 people!   “The energy saved by recycling one glass bottle can light a 100-watt light bulb for four hours or run a computer for 30 minutes.”-NASA  We recycle because YOU can make a  difference on our planet! 6  How kids can help!  Now that you know how important it is to recycle, kids like you can share what you know with the people around you and make a difference in our world! Ask your friends and family if  they recycle. If they  don’t tell them what you have learned so  they can know the how important it is for our planet!  How else could you inspire your family and friends to recycle? 7  How We Recycle  You now know why it's important to recycle, what's next to learn is how to recycle. It's important to know that there are many different things  you can recycle. Paper products like newspapers, magazines, and cardboard, are recyclable. Think about how much paper you throw away during the school year! Use the charts on the next few pages to find out what else you can  recycle! You  Did you know you can recycle pizza boxes?

They can run and bound  on land as well as swim very effectively.  Otters are known to be very playful, enjoying  sliding down snowy hills, splashing in the  water, and playing with their otter families.  5  Habitat  The river otter lives in the rivers of Northern  America as  well as  streams, lakes,  and  reservoirs.  The main  habitat of  otters is in the  water, but they  go onto land  as well. They  make their homes in burrows on the water’s  edge. Their homes feature many tunnels that  6  allow the otters to come and go as they  please.  Diet  Otters hunt at night and eat most anything  they can find. Otters are mostly  carnivorous, and fish are their favorite food,  but they will also eat turtles, insects,  amphibians, crustaceans, and crayfish.  7  Traits  Otters swim by using their powerful tails to  propel themselves and then wiggling their  bodies back and forth. They also have  webbed feet for swimming and water  repellant fur to help keep them warm and  dry. When they swim their nose and ears  close to keep the water out. They can hold  their breath under water for up to eight  minutes.  8  Families  Females have 1 to 6 babies in their  underground den. Male otters do not help  raise their young. When otters become two  months old they get their first swimming  lesson. Their mother pushes them into the  water. Otters are natural swimmers and learn  how to swim very quickly.  9  Questions:  1. Where do North American river otters  live?  2. What is an otter’s favorite food?  3. What otter family member does not help  to take care of its young?  4. What closes over on the otter’s body  when swimming so that they won’t get  water in them?  5. How long do otters usually live?  10  Answers:  1. In rivers, streams and reservoirs  2. Fish  3. Fathers  4. Their nose and ears  5. 8 to 9 years  11  12  Glossary  Mammals: Animals that nurse their young  and are most often covered in fur.  Reservoirs: Artificial lakes that are a large  store of water.  Carnivorous: Eat only meat and other  animals.  Amphibians: Animals that can live both on  land and water.  Webbed feet: Having skin that stretches in-between  the toes.  Den: The home of animals; usually a small  hole in the ground or home underneath the  earth.  13  Works Referenced  Unknown Author. “North American River Otter.""  National Geographic. N.p., n.d.

Sea  turtles  are  the  largest  turtles  in  the  world.  The  smallest  sea  turtles  weigh  around  100  pounds.  The  largest  sea  turtles  can  sometimes  weigh  as  much  1,300  pounds.  They  can  grow  to  be  the  size  of  a  bathtub!  4  Turtle  Facts  Sea  turtles  are  reptiles.  Reptiles  are  cold  blooded  animals.  This  means  that  the  temperature  of  their  bodies  changes  depending  on  their  surroundings.  Reptiles  are  covered  with  scaly  skin  and  breathe  air  through  their  lungs,  just  like  humans.  Reptiles  also  lay  eggs.  Cold-­blooded  Animals  Warm-­blooded  Animals  • Sea  turtles  • Snakes  • Lizards  • Frogs  • Dogs  • Elephants  • Humans  • Horses  5  Chapter  2:  Journey  to  the  Ocean  Female  sea  turtles  lay  their  eggs  every  2  to  5  years.  They  migrate  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  miles  until  they  reach  the  perfect  beach  to  lay  their  eggs.  They  drag  their  heavy  bodies  out  of  the  water  and  onto  the  sand.  They  dig  a  hole  about  20  inches  deep  and  into  that  hole  they  lay  about  100  small,  round  eggs.  Then,  the  mother  covers  the  eggs  with  sand  to  protect  them  and  drags  herself  back  into  the  ocean  to  swim  away.  She  will  never  see  her  babies.  6  Journey  to  the  Ocean  Many  of  the  eggs  that  the  female  sea  turtles  lay  will  never  hatch.  The  baby  turtles  that  do  hatch  have  a  long  journey  ahead  of  them.  Once  they  hatch,  they  must  first  dig  themselves  out  of  the  hole  where  the  eggs  were  buried.  As  soon  as  they  are  free,  they  must  find  their  way  to  the  ocean.  The  journey  across  the  beach  is  a  long  one  and  the  baby  turtles  must  watch  out  crabs,  seagulls,  and  other  predators  who  may  like  to  eat  them.  7  Chapter  3:  Life  in  the  Ocean  Once  the  baby  turtles  reach  the  ocean,  they  must  find  food.  While  they  are  still  small,  sea  turtles  eat  plankton,  which  are  very  small  animals  that  float  in  the  water.  As  they  begin  to  grow  and  get  bigger,  sea  turtles  start  to  eat  seaweed,  crabs,  shrimp,  and  even  jellyfish.  It  takes  between  10  and  50  years  for  sea  turtles  to  reach  their  full  size.  8  Chapter  3:  Life  in  the  Ocean  There  are  seven  different  kinds  of  sea  turtles.  The  two  largest  of  all  of  these  are  called  the  Loggerhead  Turtles  and  the  Leatherback  Turtle.  The  other  types  of  sea  turtles  are  the  Green  Turtle,  the  Hawksbill  Turtle,  the  Kemp’s,  Ridley  Turtle,  the  Olive,  and  the  Flatback  Turtle.  Sea  turtles  live  all  over  the  world.  Each  year  they  travel  hundreds  of  miles  all  over  the  ocean  looking  for  food.  No  matter  how  far  away  they  may  be,  the  female  turtles  always  return  to  lay  their  eggs  on  the  beach  where  they  were  born.  No  one  knows  how  the  turtles  remember  how  to  get  there.  9  Chapter  4:  Protect  the  Sea  Turtles  Sea  turtles  are  an  endangered  species.  This  means  that  there  are  not  very  many  of  them  left  on  Earth.  Pollution  is  one  reason  so  many  sea  turtles  are  dying  out.  The  oceans  are  full  of  fishing  nets  that  the  turtles  could  get  caught  in  plastic  bags  and  other  trash  that  would  make  them  sick  if  they  were  eaten.  People  have  built  houses  or  stores  on  the  beaches  where  sea  turtles  used  to  lay  their  eggs.  Some  people  hunt  sea  turtles  for  their  meat.  This  sea  turtle  has  been  caught  in  a  net.  10  Protect  the  Sea  Turtles  The  sea  turtle  is  a  very  special  animal.  If  steps  are  not  taken  to  protect  sea  turtles  from  pollution  and  from  being  hunted,  very  soon  there  may  be  no  more  sea  turtles  left  on  Earth.  There  are  many  wonderful  groups  of  people  all  over  the  world  that  are  trying  their  hardest  to  keep  this  beautiful  animal  safe.  11  12  Glossary  Endangered:  At  risk  of  becoming  extinct.  Migrate:  To  move  from  one  part  of  the  earth  to  another  at  certain  times  of  the  year.  Plankton:  Small  animals  and  bits  of  plants  that  float  in  the  ocean.  Pollution:  anything  that  is  harmful  to  a  certain  place.  Predators:  an  animal  that  hunts  smaller,  weaker  animals.  Reptile:  Reptiles  are  cold  blooded  animals  which  are  covered  in  scales  and  lay  eggs.  13  Works  Referenced  “Turtle  and  fish”  http://freshwatertuttle.wikispaces.com  /CarlyleCoastal  Seas  “Baby  sea  turtles”  http://mvscience.wikispaces.com/file/view/baby-­‐sea-­‐  turtles.jpg/70165919/468x319/baby-­‐sea-­‐turtles.jpg  “Sea  turtle  hatching”  http://media.tumblr.com/  tumblr_llcbt2d  i6M1qfu4j7.jpg  “Nest”  http://cache2.allpostersimages.com/p/LRG/38/3811  /  F3SIF00Z/  posters/dirscherl-­‐reinhard-­‐green-­‐sea-­‐turtle-­‐eggs-­‐in-­‐a-­‐nest-­‐on-­‐a-­‐beach-­‐  chelonia-­‐mydas-­‐pacific-­‐ocean-­‐borneo.jpg  “Swimming  Turtle”  https://www.flickr.com/photos/stevedunleavy  /6698223639/  “Turtle  Caught  in  Net”  http://indiasendangered.com/uv-­‐light-­‐  emitting-­‐diode-­‐to-­‐save-­‐endangered-­‐turtles-­‐from-­‐fish-­‐nets/  “Sea  Turtle  Map”  http://www.ecokids.ca/pub/eco_info/  topics/field_guide/maps/assets/leatherback_turtle.jpg  “Sea  Turtles”  World  Wildlife.  2015  “Sea  Turtles:  An  Overview”  Sea  Turtle  Conservatory.  2015  14  Common  Core  State  Standards  CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.2.4  Determine the meaning of words and phrases in a text relevant  to a grade 2 topic or subject area.

There are over 300 species of sharks worldwide.  Sharks first appeared over 455 million years ago!  The shark Megalodon is thought to be the largest  shark. They had teeth 6.5 inches long!  Megalodon died out 1.6 million years ago.  Remake of a  Megalodon skeleton  STOP  AND  THINK  How  soon  after  the  appearance  of  sharks  did  Megalodon  disappear?  4  Sharks are boneless fish. Their skeletons are made  of cartilage which makes them very flexible.  Sharks grow and lose teeth all the time. They are  always teething.  Instead of scales, sharks are covered in denticles.  The denticles help sharks move very quickly  through the water.  Denticles underneath a  microscope  Tiger Shark teeth  5  Chapter 2  SHARK SENSES  Sharks have many senses that help them track  down their prey.  A shark’s sense of smell is very highly focused. A  shark can use this sense to locate bleeding prey.  Sharks have two senses that humans do not.  The first is the Ampullae of Lorenzini, which are  located on a shark’s head.  The Ampullae allow sharks to sense electricity  made by other animals.  Ampuallae of Lorenzini  pores in a Tiger Shark  snout  6  The other sense sharks have that humans do not is  called a lateral line.  Lateral lines allow sharks to feel vibrations of  everything moving in the water.  The lateral line system runs down the shark’s entire  body.  A Blue Shark  STOP AND THINK  What are two senses sharks  have that humans do not?  What do sharks use these  senses for?  7  Chapter 3  WHERE DO SHARKS LIVE?  Sharks are found almost everywhere on Earth.  Almost all sharks are saltwater species.  Sharks live wherever there is a lot of their prey.  Sharks either live in the open water or stay on the  bottom of the ocean.  Location of shark species is dark blue.  8  Sharks are most common in warmer waters right  off of continents.  The most common places for swimmers to be  attacked by sharks are often crowded beaches.  The Bull Shark is one of very few sharks that can  go in fresh water. Bull Sharks can attack swimmers  in rivers away from oceans.  STOP AND THINK  Why do swimmers get attacked at  beaches?  Deadliest Places For Shark Attacks  9  Chapter 4  WHAT DO SHARKS EAT?  Different sharks eat different prey.  Whale Sharks and Basking Sharks eat plankton.  Other sharks eat fish, shrimp, squid, turtles, or  penguins.  Different kinds of sharks have different kinds of  teeth because they all eat different food.  A Basking Shark Eating  10  The Great White Shark eats seals.  It is thought that Great White attacks on humans  happen because the shark thinks the person is a  seal!  Sharks get confused  11  Chapter 5  DIFFERENT KINDS OF SHARKS  There are many different kinds of sharks.  WHALE SHARK  The Whale Shark is the biggest shark in the ocean.  It can be 65 feet long!  It has rows of teeth but it only eats very small  plankton.  12  GREAT WHITE SHARK  The Great White Shark is probably the most  famous shark because of the movie JAWS.  Great White Sharks grow up to 23-ft long.  The Great White is the shark most people think of  when they hear the word, “shark!”  The Great White shark is one of the three kinds of  sharks that are considered the most dangerous.  13  BULL SHARK  The Bull Shark is another shark considered very  dangerous.  The Bull Shark can be found in fresh water, such as  rivers or lakes. It can live very close to humans and  has a high attack record.  Bull Sharks eat other sharks, including little Bull  Sharks.  Bull Sharks can grow to around 10-ft long.  14  TIGER SHARK  The Tiger Shark is the third most dangerous shark.  Tiger Sharks will eat anything! This is what makes  them dangerous to humans.  Tiger Sharks have eaten: other tiger sharks, car  license plates, dogs, turtles, fish, a chicken coop,  and deer antlers.  This has  given them  the  nickname,  “the  garbage can  of the sea.”  Tiger Sharks have stripes that fade away when they  become adults.  Tiger Sharks can grow over 20-ft long.  15  Ragged-Tooth Shark  Ragged-Tooth Sharks live up to their name! They  have very jagged teeth.  Although they may look scary, Ragged Tooth  Sharks are fairly calm.  They have never killed a human and only attack  when bothered.  This shark is also known as the Grey Nurse or  Sand Tiger Shark.  Ragged-Tooth sharks can hang in the water by  gulping air which is then held in its stomach.  16  SHARK QUIZ  1. Which shark is known as the Sand  Tiger?  2. Which shark can be 65 ft long?  3.

In Idaho,  rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, steelhead, and bull trout are  native. Their average lengths can be anywhere from 8 to 38  inches depending on type and lifestyle. Many are resident  trout and live in cool, clear, freshwater streams and lakes  that range from 50-60 degrees Fahrenheit. Rainbow trout  and steelhead are the exact same fish, however steelhead are  much larger and have become anadromous.  Cutthroat  Trout  Timothy  Knepp  U.S. Fish  and Wildlife  Services  Trout feed on a variety of things. Their diets consist  of smaller fish and insects. These include flies, mayflies,  caddis flies, stoneflies, and dragonflies. Larger trout may  also feed on shrimp, worms, and even eel! The fish’s diets  vary with location, time of year, and water temperature.  Some fishermen will carry thermometers with them to be  able to determine the exact food that will attract the most  fish.  4  Types of Trout  There are three major groups of trout called generas.  Two of these groups are native to Idaho, while the third is  invasive. The main differences between the groups are  where they originated. This creates differences in when the  fish spawn and slight differences in habitat.  Rainbow  Trout  Timothy Knepp  U.S. Fish and  Wildlife  Services  Oncorhynchus is a group of fish species that includes  Rainbow trout, Steelhead, Cutthroat trout, and some forms  of salmon. The Oncorhynchus group is native to Idaho. This  genus of fish spawns in the spring.  Salvelinus is the second genus that includes fish that are  native to Idaho. The bull trout is in this genus. Not all trout  in the genus are native to Idaho. The brook trout and lake  trout are both in this genus and both in Idaho but are not  5  native to the state. The fish that make up this group spawn  in the fall.  Although there are trout from the genus Salmo in  Idaho they are not native to the region. The only Salmo in  Idaho is the brown trout. Salmo are not native to North  America at all. Europeans introduced any members of this  genus found in North America.  Chapter 2: Sturgeon  Sturgeon is a special fish because of their lifespan.  They have an average life span of 50-60 years. At the  Bonneville Fish Hatchery in Oregon there is a sturgeon  named Herman that is 70 years old. Although they are  smaller in Idaho, sturgeon can grow to 18 feet and weigh  more than 4,000 pounds!  74 Lb Sturgeon  Mark Luehring and Josh  Schlosser  US Fish and Wildlife Services  6  Although they are in the category of bony fishes, their  skeleton is composed of mainly cartilage. Sturgeon also  have boney plates called scutes instead of scales like many  other fish do.  Sturgeon have a way of looking for food that is much  different than that of other fish. Sturgeon look for food  using four barbels. The barbels help the fish to taste their  food when they are swimming near the murky bottom of a  stream where they cannot see. They drag the barbels across  the bottom of the stream then snatch their food up when  they taste it is there.  In this photo shows the barbels  of a sturgeon. We can see that  they are in front of the mouth to  sense food before it goes in.  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Sturgeon are not unique to Idaho. They can live in a  very wide range of habitats all over the northern hemisphere.  Just a few places they have been found are all over the U.S,  in the oceans outside of Italy, in rivers in china, and in the  Gulf of Mexico.  7  Chapter 3: Salmon  Sockeye, chinook, and kokanee salmon are all native  to Idaho. There are many differences between the different  types of salmon. Both sockeye and chinook salmon are  anadromous while kokanee are not.  Chinook used to live in drainages throughout Idaho,  but because of damming on the Snake and Columbia rivers  many fish can no longer make it this far. There are many  hatcheries in the state that are stocking Salmon in the state  in the hopes that they will return to spawn. In the last 5 years  there have been increases in chinook running up the Snake  and Salmon rivers in Idaho. In Idaho, chinook can get up to  around 45 pounds and from 18-40 inches in length.  Chinook Salmon  U.S. Government  Sockeye salmon are in a very similar situation. In the  late 1980s only one sockeye made it all the way to the  spawning location of Red Fish Lake. There are huge  hatcheries that are dedicated to the restoration of sockeye to  the waterways of Idaho. Sadly, only small amounts of the fish  return to spawn.  8  Sockeye Salmon Timothy Knepp U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.  Kokanee salmon are a resident fish in Idaho and live  in the deep lakes around the state. They are also known as  “Bluebacks” or “Silvers”  because of their blue and green  backs and silver bellies. In  Idaho, they are about 10-12  inches and between a pound  and a pound and a half when  full grown. Between September  and December, Kokanee move  from lakes into the rivers to  spawn. The females will use  their tales to make a redd on  the shore of the river. Salmon  make their redds by using their  talks to brush the larger rocks  out of the way. They lay their eggs in the redd.  9  Kokanee Salmon  California Department of Fish and Wildlife  Lamprey sketch by Ellen Edmonson and Hugh Crisp for a New York study by the Conservation Department.  Chapter 4: Lamprey  Lamprey are interesting because they do not have  jaws. Their mouth is a circle that is located at the front  bottom of their faces. Their mouths are full of lots of teeth.  Unlike the other fish in this book, lamprey feed by acting as  a parasite. They will attach to larger fish and suck their  blood. In some places they are referred to as the vampires  of the deep. Lamprey are among the oldest organisms on  Earth and existed many years before dinosaurs did.  Scientists can date them back to around 300 million years.  We know this because lamprey developed before jaws had  evolved.  The inside of a lamprey’s mouth is  filled with lots of sharp teeth. The  lamprey has a circular mouth and does  not have a jaw.  T. Lawrence  The Great Lakes Fisheries Commission  10  Lamprey are anadromous and catadromous. The  pacific varieties of lamprey are anadromous. When lamprey  are migrating inland they use their suckers to climb up dam  walls. They will suck onto the wall, throw their bodies  upward, and jump a few inches upward, sucking onto the  wall again. Lamprey also use their suckers when creating  their redds. Instead of brushing the rocks out of the way,  they use their suckers to grab onto the rocks and move  them away.  Lamprey attached  to a lake trout to  feed.  U.S. Geological Survey  In places like Idaho, lamprey are native and help to  balance the environment. This is not the case everywhere  they live. In the 1950s, lamprey used the boat passageways  to make it to the Great Lakes. For the past 60 years, the  government has been working to remove the lamprey from  the lakes because they are killing all of the fish that are  native to the environment.  11  Chapter 5: Burbot  Burbot are among the stranger fish that inhabit  Idaho’s waters. In Idaho, burbot are only native in the  Kootenai River. They are the only fresh water version of the  cod family. Burbot are identified by their one corkscrewing  barbell, which sticks out of the middle of their chins. They  look like a cross between a catfish and an eel.  When they are younger they eat mostly plankton, and  when they are adults they eat insects and other fish. Burbot  metamorphoses when they are newly hatched, completely  changing their shape, which is similar to a butterfly. Burbot  require almost a month of frigidly cold water, sitting at 33  degrees Fahrenheit, to spawn. They are the only fish that  spawn in the dead of winter under the ice. A female burbot  at spawn can lay almost 4 million eggs. In the summer they  can stand temperatures up to 82 degrees Fahrenheit.  Burbot Virgil Beck for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources  12  Chapter 6: Non Native and Invasive  Fishes  What is the difference between non-native and  invasive fishes?  The largemouth bass is  not native to Idaho. It  was brought in as a fish  for fisherman to catch.  Timothy Knepp  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services  Both invasive and non-native fish are living in  environments where they did not originally develop or  evolve. If a fish is not native to an environment it can still  thrive there without having an effect on the environment and  the animals living there. An invasive fish is a non-native fish  that has an effect on the environment and the other animals  that live there. Invasiveness can occur for many different  reasons. Sometimes the new species will eat the fish that  already live there or they will eat the same food and not leave  enough for the other species to survive. Other times they are  not a food source for the natural predators of an  13  environment and they are allowed to reproduce without  anything to slow them down.  What are the effects of invasive fishes?  Lake trout  search the depths  of Yellowstone  Lake in search of  food.  Timothy Knepp  U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Services  Invasive species can be very detrimental to  environments where they do not belong. A lamprey, for  example, is not detrimental to the river drainages or oceans  where they are native. On the other hand, when the sea  lamprey made it to the Great Lakes, they nearly killed all of  the native fish. In this case, lampreys became invasive by  killing the fish that were already there. Invasive fish can  effect more than just fish populations and environments.  The Great Lakes is a large area for commercial and  recreational fishing. When the lampreys began to kill all of  the fish there became too few fish for all of the catching that  was needed. The economy of the area struggled because  there were not enough fish for the companies to sell.  14  An example that is closer to home is that of  Yellowstone Lake. The fish that are native to Yellowstone  Lake are the Cutthroat Trout. At some point, no one is quite  sure how, Lake Trout were introduced into the lake. The  Lake Trout eat the young Cutthroat Trout and have led to  decreases in the population of Cutthroat Trout in the lake. If  the Lake Trout continue to survive in Yellowstone, the  Cutthroat population could fall to 10% of what it was  historically.  Invasive Fishes in Idaho  Even though  smallmouth and  largemouth bass are  closely related, they live  in completely different  environments.  Timothy Knepp  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.  Many of the non-native fish living in Idaho are here  because they are game fish. A game fish is a fish that  fishermen like to catch, but it is often a challenge to do so.  Bass, Pike, and Walleye are all game fish that have been  introduced to Idaho over the years. People also like these  fish, particularly Pike and Walleye, because they taste good.  15  Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are found in  Idaho. Bass are a piscivorous fish, which means they feed  on smaller fish. Largemouth like to live in warm, grassy lakes,  while smallmouth prefer rocky habitats. Largemouth and  smallmouth bass are native in the Mississippi drainage area.  Bass have been introduced around the world as game fish  and have caused a lot of damage to natural habitats. There  are a few fish species scattered around the globe that went  extinct after bass were introduced.  Brown Trout  Timothy Knepp  U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Services  The fish we have talked about so far do not have  cousins that are native to Idaho. The brown trout and lake  trout might seem native to Idaho because many trout are  native. Both of these species are in fact non-native and can  be detrimental to the native populations. Brown trout are not  native to North America at all, but are only native in Europe.  Neither species of trout is terribly detrimental to the  environment in Idaho, but any time a fish is not native they  will have some effect on the native populations.  16  Glossary  Fishes: The plural term for fish when referring to  more than one species of fish.

That’s almost 2,268,750 football fields!   Approximately 7.5 billion board feet of timber—enough to build 2-3 hundred thousand homes—was burned.   There were at least 85 casualties.   The fires burned up several towns.   There was so much smoke that it darkened the sky as far south as Denver, Colorado, and as far east as Waterton, New York. To the west, ships 500 miles out at sea couldn’t navigate using the stars because smoke filled the sky.   Soot from the fires fell on Greenland.  11  Media Attributions  Cover photograph by Cameron Strandberg.

Richard was working to  invent a spring to keep sensitive  equipment steady while on a boat in  the ocean. He accidently knocked  the spring off of his work table and,  to his amazement, the spring  walked down a stack of books to  the ground.  3  Richard was intrigued! He wanted  to know how this worked and why it  walked down to the ground. He  tinkered with this idea for over a  year by using different metals,  wires, spiral sizes, and wire flatness.  He finally perfected it in 1945.  4  Richard and his wife, Betty, decided  to show off their new invention.  When showing the spring to the  Betty realized that the spring had  real potential as a children’s toy.  5  Once Richard and Betty knew their  toy was going to be a hit, they  decided to pursue the idea of selling  a toy! First, Betty searched the  dictionary thoroughly to invent a  name. She chose to name their  spring toy, The Slinky.  6  Next, Richard and Betty set off to  sell their new invention. They visited  dozens of toy stores and none of  them were interested in their toy,  saying it was boring and that it  would not catch a customer’s eye.  After months of determination, a  toy store named Gimbels gave them  a small display area in November of  1945.  7  The 400 Slinkys sat on the shelf  untouched for weeks.  Discouraged but determined,  Roger called his wife and asked her  to meet him at the toy store  because he had received  permission to give a  demonstration to the kids about  how the Slinky worked.  8  By the time Betty reached Gimbels  an hour and a half later, Richard  had sold all 400 Slinkys for $1  apiece, and had a line waiting for  more! They had done it! People  wanted their invention!  9  Richard and Betty immediately  began to produce more Slinkys for  the rising demand. By Christmas of  that year, the couple had sold over  20,000 Slinkys!  10  Ever since then, the Slinky’s  popularity has continued to rise and  has remained one of the most  commonly purchased toys for over  11  70 years, including the addition of  the Slinky Dog in 1952.  12  The Slinky is mentioned on the list  of 100 Greatest Toys of All Time  alongside Legos, the Magic 8 Ball,  and tons of other great toys. It was  also inducted into the Toy Hall of  Fame in 2000.  13  The Slinky has been one of the most  successful toys in U.S. history. Here  is a timeline documenting the most  important or cool moments during  the Slinky’s existence.  14  Glossary:  Mechanical Engineer – The branch of  engineering dealing with the design and  production of machinery.

These eggs are laid in groups of 10 -75 eggs which are protected by a jelly that retains water. These egg groups are attached to underwater branches or grass.  5  Chapter 2 – Tadpoles  The eggs will hatch in about three to five weeks. The forming tadpoles can be seen through the eggs toward the end of the eggs growth. Tadpoles are the larval stage of an amphibian.  Above is a group of eggs in the late stages of growth. Small tadpoles can be seen forming inside each egg.  6  Once the eggs hatch, the new tadpoles will seek out algae, dead vegetation, and insects for food. The tadpole will be completely reliant on water for survival. They have gills. Six weeks after hatching the tadpoles will grow back legs.  7  Chapter 3 – Adult Frog Transition  Ten weeks after hatching the tadpoles will form usable lungs. They will be able to breathe through these lungs and will need to come to the surface of the water for air. At this point, the tadpoles will be growing front legs.  The Pacific tree frogs’ new lungs will allow them to leave the water. Their tale is being absorbed into their body.  8  Chapter 4 – Adult Frog Habitat  Pacific Tree Frogs live in lots of different habitats. They can be found in wetlands, meadows, woodlands or areas with bushes. During Spring they will move from these areas into ponds, slow streams and seasonal ponds. Tree frogs spend most of their lives outside of water but in damp areas. If the area is too dry, the Pacific Tree Frog will only be active during the night when they are able to escape the intensity of the sun. The Pacific Tree Frogs also need to be in an area with a food supply. They feed on insects as adults, and algae, vegetation, and dean insects as tadpoles. 9  Chapter 5 – Lifespan  Pacific Tree Frogs live about two years when in the wild. They have pads on the ends of their toes that allow them to climb to get their food. Pacific Tree Frogs feed on insects. The Pacific Tree Frog catch their prey with their tongues. Their tongues are long and elastic with a sticky tip that allows them to grab their prey.  10  Works Referenced  Content Wildlife, Living With. PACIFIC TREEFROG (n.d.): n. pag.

He had no  formal education until he was eight, and didn’t  attend high school until he was 16.  Instead of following in his family’s footsteps and  working in a Chicago factory, he began searching  for an artistic position. After several failed jobs,  Disney eventually found success creating  animations in a series of cartoons called “Laugh-  O-Grams.” This sudden triumph led Disney to  pursue a career in animation.  Screenshot of Newman Laugh-O-Gram. (Public Domain)  4  Animated Success  In 1926, Disney created his first real, original  character: a rabbit named Oswald.  Screenshot of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit film. 1927. (Public Domain)  Oswald’s immediate success came with a  drawback: Universal reduced Disney’s contract  compensation. Disney refused the offer and lost  the rights to his lucky rabbit. However, with this  loss came the motivation to create a new  character. Disney had been sketching a cartoon  mouse character for years, but it wasn’t until 1928  that he took to the silver screen.  5  Mickey Mouse debuted in a black and white short  called “Steamboat Willie.” Mickey took on many  new roles in countless shorts, feature films, and  animated TV roles.

Copyright  MCMXXIX (1929) DISNEY.  6  The Happiest Place(s) On Earth  In the late 1940s, Disney began planning a theme  park after visiting a park with his children. His  inspiration came from wanting a place that  children and their families could play together.  Disneyland opened in 1955 on July 17th. On a live  television broadcast, Disney said the following  words:  “To all who come to this happy place; welcome.  Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond  memories of the past ... and here youth may savor  the challenge and promise of the future.”  Despite a few  hiccups on opening  day, Disneyland  was an immediate  success. The  seventeen-million  dollar investment  had paid off, and  Walt Disney was an  international hero  to families all over  the country. Walt Disney sits on a grassy lawn with his  grandson, in front Sleeping Beauty’s castle  at Disneyland. (Gene Lester/Getty Images)  7  In 1965 Disney announced the plans for his second  theme park after purchasing a very large plot of  land in Orlando, Florida. Then called “The Florida  Project,” the new park resort would include the  Magic Kingdom and the Experimental Prototype  Community of Tomorrow (E.P.C.O.T.) The Magic  Kingdom would be very similar to its Disneyland  predecessor, though Epcot was originally planned  to be a futuristic livable city.  Sadly, Walt Disney died of lung cancer before the  park was even opened. However, the park now  known as Walt Disney World was finished and  opened by Walt’s brother Roy in 1971.

Monarch  Butterflies  have  orange  and  black  stripes  on  their  wings.  The  sides  of  their  wings  are  spotted  with  white  dots.  These  butterflies  are  known  for  their  colorful  looks.  Life  Cycle  of  the  Butterfly  The  butterfly  begins  as  a  small  egg.  When  it  hatches,  it  will  be  a  caterpillar.  The  caterpillars  eat  as  much  food  as  they  can  to  prepare  to  be  a  butterfly.  The  caterpillar  eats  a  plant  called  milkweed.  It  is  poisonous  to  all  animals.  When  the  caterpillar  eats  this  plant,  it  becomes  poisonous  too,  which  protects  it  from  being  eaten.  When  the  caterpillar  gets  too  big  for  its  skin,  its  skin  splits  and  sheds.  This  is  called  molting.  It  happens  four  times  over  a  two-­‐week  period.  Once  the  caterpillar  sheds  its  skin  for  the  last  time,  it  will  harden  into  a  chrysalis  or  pupa.  The  chrysalis  or  pupa  is  the  coating  of  skin  that  will  protect  the  butterfly  while  it  transforms.  While  in  the  chrysalis  stage,  the  butterfly  starts  to  transform,  or  change.  This  can  take  12  to  15  days,  but  when  the  chrysalis  breaks  a  butterfly  comes  out.  Migrating  Butterfly  Monarch  butterflies  tend  to  live  in  the  Northwestern  parts  of  the  U.S.  Although,  they  are  known  to  live  all  over  the  country  and  can  even  be  found  in  the  state  of  Idaho.  The  butterflies  born  in  the  summer  or  spring  are  fully  grown  in  a  few  days.  In  the  fall,  many  of  them  will  begin  to  travel  to  a  warmer  place  to  live.  This  is  called  migration.  After  the  butterflies  migrate,  they  join  together  to  create  butterfly  trees  in  the  warmer  climate.  Thousands  of  butterflies  can  land  on  just  one  tree.  Sometimes  branches  fall  off  of  these  trees  because  they  are  so  heavy.

The solar system is an exciting  place that was formed over 4.6  billion years ago! It is made up  of all the things that orbit the  sun.  4  Some things that make up the  solar system include planets,  comets, belts, asteroids,  meteoroids, and moons.  5  Planets  There are eight planets in our  solar system. These planets are  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,  Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and  Neptune.  6  Mercury  Mercury is the first planet from  the sun. It is a small, rocky  world. Mercury is a lot like the  Moon.  7  Venus  Venus is the second planet from  the Sun. In some ways, Venus is  Earth’s twin. It is about the same  size as Earth and is made of the  same rocky materials. It is the  brightest object in the night sky  apart from the Moon.  8  Earth  Earth is the third planet from  the sun. It takes 365 days to  complete one orbit of the Sun.  The tilt of the axis that joins the  north and south poles means  that the Earth has seasons.  9  Mars  Mars is the fourth planet from  the Sun. Mars is often called the  'Red Planet' because it appears in  the sky as an orange-red star.  Mars is also very cold.  10  Jupiter  Beyond the asteroid belt is  Jupiter, which is the fifth planet  from the Sun. Everything about  Jupiter is large. It is so big that it  could easily swallow all of the  other planets. Jupiter is a giant  ball of gas, with no solid surface.  11  Saturn  Saturn is the sixth planet from  the Sun. Most of the planet is  made up of gas. If you could put  all of the planets in a pool of  water, Saturn is the only one that  would float.  12  Uranus  Uranus is the seventh planet  from the Sun. It is a giant world,  the third largest planet in our  solar system. Uranus has 27  known moons and has twelve  dark, dusty rings.  13  Neptune  Neptune is the farthest planet  from the sun. It is almost an  identical twin of Uranus. It has  at least five dark, narrow rings  and thirteen moons.  14  Asteroid Belt  There is also an Asteroid belt in  the solar system. This band of  asteroids sits between the orbits  of the planets Jupiter and Mars.  It is made up of thousands of  objects too small to be  considered planets.  15  These are only a few awesome  facts, there is always much more  to learn about our remarkable  solar system!  What Do You Remember?  1. How old is the solar system?  2. How many planets are  there?  3. What is the closest planet  to the sun?  4. What is the band between  Jupiter and Mars?  16  Glossary  Comets: They are made out of  dust and ice, kind of like a dirty  snowball.  Meteoroids: Any small object in  Outer Space, such as dust or a  rock.  Orbit: The path one object  takes around another.  Axis: An imaginary straight line  on which an object rotates.  17  Works Referenced  - Our Solar System."" Astronomy.com.  Kidsknowit.com. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.  - Solar System Facts."" Science Kids!

CCSS.ELA-­‐Literacy.RI.4.10  By  the  end  of  year,  read  and  comprehend  informational  texts,  including  history/social  studies,  science,  and  technical  texts,  in  the  grades  4-­‐5  text  complexity  band  proficiently,  with  scaffolding  as  needed  at  the  high  end  of  the  range.  1  Two  million  years  ago,  during  the  Pleistocene  age,  mastodons  and  saber-­‐toothed  cats  roamed  the  lands  of  North  America.  Teratorn  birds  soared  across  the  skies,  and  Giant  Beavers  lived  near  lakes  and  swamps.  2  It  was  during  the  Pleistocene  that  the  most  recent  ice  age  occurred.  Global  temperatures  dropped,  and  glaciers  formed  when  the  ice  and  snow  of  winter  remained  frozen  year  round.  As  more  and  more  layers  of  snow  accumulated,  it  became  compacted  into  massive  frozen  sheets,  creating  the  glaciers.  These  glaciers  often  formed  at  high  elevations  and  slowly  moved  downhill.  3  In  the  area  that  is  now  western  Montana,  a  moving  glacier  blocked  the  mouth  of  the  Clark  Fork  River,  forming  a  dam.  Water  filled  up  behind  the  ice  sheet  until  it  formed  a  massive  lake  that  was  as  big  as  Lake  Erie  and  Lake  Ontario  combined.  Lake  Missoula  continued  to  grow,  exerting  more  and  more  pressure  on  the  glacial  dam.  Eventually,  water  lifted  the  frozen  sheet.  As  the  ice  became  buoyant,  water  flooded  underneath.  4  A  river  with  water  flowing  at  thirty  to  fifty  miles  an  hour  rushed  across  the  land.  Today,  scientists  estimate  that  it  took  less  than  a  week  for  Lake  Missoula  to  drain.  In  many  areas,  the  flood  of  water  swept  away  topsoil,  leaving  a  ragged,  rocky  surface.  The  “scabland”  created  by  these  glacial  floods  covers  much  of  eastern  Washington.  Unlike  the  fertile  areas  that  surround  the  scablands,  these  rough  and  rocky  areas  have  proven  difficult  to  farm  on.  5  The  river  also  cut  a  deep  gorge  where  the  Columbia  River  still  flows  today.  It  created  steep  canyons  and  rocky  cliffs  like  the  one  in  the  picture  below.  6  After  traveling  430  miles,  the  river  finally  flowed  into  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Then,  the  process  began  again.  Scientists  believe  that  Lake  Missoula  filled  and  flooded  dozens  of  times  over  the  course  of  several  millennia,  perhaps  as  often  as  every  fifty  years.  7  Can  you  find:  • The  scablands  of  eastern  Washington?  • The  Columbia  River  and  the  Pacific  Ocean?

The water on Earth gets recycled over and  over again – this is known best as “The Water  Cycle,” but is also called the Hydrologic  Cycle. The earth’s water has been around for  pretty much as long as the earth has been  around.  4  Step 1: Evaporation  Evaporation happens when the sun’s heat  turns water in lakes, rivers, streams, and  puddles into vapor. This also happens to the  water that is on plants. That process is called  transpiration.  5  Step 2: Condensation  When the water condenses and turns cold  after being vaporized, it turns into clouds.  There are many different kinds of clouds!  6  Step 3: Precipitation  When there’s too much water in the clouds  and the clouds turn heavy, and the air can’t  hold all the water anymore, it causes  precipitation, or rain!  (Public domain)  7  Step 4: Collection  When rain falls, it falls back into the lakes,  rivers, streams, forms puddles, and collects  on the surface of the ground. The water  seeps into the earth and forms groundwater.  The water also becomes runoff and flows  downhill into the sea to become part of the  water cycle once again!

In the past, whales were hunted for their meat, blubber, and bones. Now, it is illegal to hunt most whales.  4  How Whales Breathe  When most people think of a whale, they think it is a fish. Even though whales live in the sea, they are not fish. Whales actually hold their breath when they are under water. When they come up to the surface of the water, they breathe out. Moist air shoots out of their blow hole. 5  Kinds of Whales  There are many different kinds of whales. Some whales have teeth, they are called toothed whales. The whales that do not have teeth are called baleen whales. These whales have a baleen plate in their mouth that helps keep plants and small fish inside and strain out the water.  6  A humpback whale is an example of a baleen whale. Like all whales, humpbacks have two tail fins called flukes. Their flukes have markings that are like fingerprints in people. No two whales have the same markings.  A fun fact that you may not know about humpback whales is that they can sing. A song that they sing is made up of a series of sounds that they repeat. Their songs can go on for hours. Scientists believe that these songs are used to attract a mate.  7  A Whales Home  In the summertime, humpback whales live and feed in cold waters. Whales use a trick in order to catch their food. They go underwater and blow bubbles that trap little fish.  Before wintertime, whales migrate to warmer water. In the summer, whales live in the cold water near Alaska. During the winter, they live in the warm waters near Mexico.  8  Baby Whales  A baby whale is called a calf. Calves are born while the mothers are in the warm waters. When the calf is born, the mother whale helps bring it to the surface to take its first breath.  9  Works Referenced  Berger, Melvin. (1993). As Big As a Whale.

He was one of five children,  four boys and one girl. Growing up, Walt  loved to draw, paint, and sell his pictures to  his neighbors, family, and friends. During  high school, Walt took several drawing and  painting classes. He was also a cartoonist for  the school paper.  After returning from France where he served  in the army as an ambulance driver, Walt  began to work for many different design, art,  and ad companies.  4  Getting Started: During his time at these  studios, Walt met Fred Harman who became  his first employee. The two created Laugh-O-Grams,  which were wildly popular. The  success of the show even earned Walt enough  money to allow him to open his own studio.  Over time however, the series began to  decline in popularity and Disney was forced  to declare bankruptcy. Walt Disney, his  brother Roy Disney, and his friend Ub Iwerks  pooled their money together and moved to  Hollywood in 1923 to pursue their dreams.  5  For years, Walt had been working on a new  animated character called Oswald the Lucky  Rabbit. This new series was gaining attention  and was beginning to become very  successful. However, in late 1928, Disney  discovered that his good friend M.J. Winkler  and her husband had stolen the rights to the  character and he could no longer take claim  for Oswald. They had even taken all of  Walt’s employees. All animators, except Ub  Iwerks had left Walt.  Upset about the recent news, Disney rode the  train home, doodling on the piece of paper  the entire way. The result of these doodles  was a mouse who he names, Mickey.  6  Mickey Mouse and Friends: Now left  with only Ub to help animate the character,  and Walt’s wife Lillian, and sister-in-law Edna  to add ink to the illustrations, they worked  hard to produce three Mickey Mouse  cartoons. The first two cartoons didn’t sell  very well, so Disney decided to add some  sound to the final cartoon short. This last  animation was called Steamboat Willie, and it  was all Walt Disney needed to finally break  into the industry!  7  Walt Disney was now running in the big  leagues. He had his own studio now, which  he named Walt Disney Studios. He created  several more cartoon series, Silly Symphonies,  Flowers and Trees, and Three Little Pigs. Flowers  and Trees was the first cartoon to ever be  produced in color and it was the first cartoon  to win an Oscar award. Walt also began work  on Mickey and Friends, creating characters  Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto,  and plenty more to accompany Mickey on all  of his adventures.  8  Walt Disney struck gold in 1937, when he  released the first ever full-length animated  film in Los Angeles called, Snow White and the  Seven Dwarfs. This movie produces $1.499  million dollars and won a total of eight Oscar  awards. During the next five years, Walt  Disney Studios would complete four other  full-length animated films, Pinocchio, Fantasia,  Dumbo, and Bambi.  9  After a brief  period of internal  complications at  Walt Disney  Studios, the  company released  Cinderella in 1950.  Shortly following,  the releases of  Treasure Island,  Alice in  Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp,  Sleeping Beauty, and 101 Dalmatians occurred.  10  Disney’s last major success that he produced  himself was the film Mary Poppins, which  mixed live action and animation. Mary  Poppins was wildly successful and brought in  a ton of revenue.  11  Disneyland and Dying: During his  prime time of movie success, Walt Disney  decided to open a theme park, which he  would call Disneyland. This $17 million dollar  theme park opened July of 1955 in Anaheim,  California. In no time at all, Disneyland was  earning way more than what investors had  originally predicted and began to attract  tourists from all over the world. Disneyland  became known as a place for children and  adults to meet characters, ride attractions,  and explore the world of Disney.  12  Just a few short  years after  Disneyland was  opened, Walt  was diagnosed  with lung cancer.  Just one year  later, Disney  passed away on  December 15,  1966.  Determined to  carry out his  brother’s legacy, Roy Disney continued the  plans to finish the Florida theme park Walt  had been working on shortly before his death,  and opened the new park in 1971 under the  name Walt Disney World.  13  Walt’s Legacy: To this day, Walt Disney  Studios is still in operation, often partnering  with sister studios to produce new animated  and live actions films each year. Some of the  company’s most recent and successful films  include Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up,  Enchanted, The Princess and the Frog, Tangled,  Frozen, The Good Dinosaur, and Inside Out.  The company even has its own television  channel, Disney Channel, which features both  animated and live action television series for  children and pre-teens. Some of the most  successful series include: Hannah Montana,  Phineas and Ferb, Suite Life of Zach and Cody,  Jessie, and Austin and Ally.  14  Today, Walt Disney is most remembered for  his beloved characters, brilliant animated  feature films, and beautiful theme parks. His  legacy continues to carry on throughout all  the movies and television shows produced  through his very own studio. Walt Disney  broke barriers in the film industry and truly  left his mark in the world of all things  animation. Without him, we would not know  a lot of the characters we’ve grown up loving.  And to think, it all started with a mouse.  15  Walt’s Timeline  1901- Walt was born  1919- Walt returns from France and begins job with  Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio  1923- Laugh-O-Grams published  1925- Walt and Lillian get married  1928- The rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit are stolen  1929- Mickey Mouse is created and quickly becomes a  huge hit  1937- Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiers as the  first full-length animated film  1940-1964- More animated films are released by Walt  Disney Studios  1955- Disneyland opens its doors to the public  1966- Walt is diagnosed with lung cancer and passes away  1971- Walt Disney World opens  16  Works Referenced  “Walt Disney” by Wikipedia available under a Creative Commons  Attribution-ShareAlike License.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney  “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)” by Wikipedia  available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike  License.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(19  37_film)  “Walt Disney” by Biography.com.  http://www.biography.com/people/walt-disney-9275533#death  “Walt Disney Biography” by IMDB.com  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000370/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm  https://d23.com/about-walt-disney/  www.forbes.com  http://thisdayindisneyhistory.homestead.com/dec16.html  http://abc7ny.com/entertainment/see-what-disneyland-looked-like-on-  opening-day-in-1955/856867/  http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2013/12/21/history/post-perspective/  the-trouble-with-the-real-mary-poppins.html  http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Fairy_tale-based_Laugh-O-Grams  http://www.pgecurrents.com/2013/11/20/san-francisco-pge-hosts-  17  free-day-at-walt-disney-family-museum/  http://theretroset.com/oh-mickey-hes-so-fine-85-years-of-mickey-mouse-  and-steamboat-willie/  http://antikewl.com/daily/category/disney/page/3/  18  Common Core State  Standards  CCSS.RI.1.1- Ask and answer questions about key  details in a text.

Walt had three brothers  and one sister. He grew up in  Marceline, Missouri.  Walt started drawing  when he was young and  would sell his drawings to  friends and family.  Walt took art classes  when he was in high school  and helped make the  cartoons for the school  paper.  4  When he was 16 he  dropped out of high school to  join the Army. However, he  was rejected because he was  underage.  Instead, he joined the Red  Cross and spent a year in  France driving an  ambulance.  5  Chapter Two  Early Career  Before ""Disney""  Once Walt returned from  France he pursued his career  as a newspaper artist.  His brother helped him  get a job at Pesmen-Rubin  Art Studio.  There he created  commercials and started  experimenting with a camera  and incorporating hand-drawn  animation.  This sparked something  in Walt and he decided to  open his own ad company.  6  He started making  cartoons for Kansas City  Theater, but unfortunately  went bankrupt.  Walt and his brother put  their money together and  opened the Disney Brother  Studio, in California.  7  Chapter 3  Early Achievements  Mickey Mouse was one of  Walt's greatest creations.  Mickey Mouse was originally  called Mortimer. It was  Disney’s wife that suggested  changing Mortimer's name to  Mickey.  8  Mickey's friends Donald,  Pluto, and Goofy were  introduced in the 1930s. This  change brought new life,  interest, and excitement to  Mickey Mouse.  Snow White and the  Seven Dwarfs was one of  Disney's biggest beginning  movies because the profit  from this movie allowed Walt  to build a new state-of-the-art  studio.  This movie opened doors  for Walt, which allowed him  to create other movies like  Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo,  and Bambi.  9  Chapter 4  Later Achievements  Walt continued to have  success and created many  more popular hits, such as  Mary Poppins, 101  Dalmatians, The Sword in  the Stone, and The Mickey  Mouse Club.  One of Walt's most  famous creations is the  Disneyland interactive theme  park. This park was so  popular that there were  Disneyland branches in  Tokyo, Paris and Hong Kong.  10  U.S  Paris  11  Chapter 5  Continued Successes  After Death  Walt Disney died  December 15, 1966. He died  from lung cancer at the age  of 65.  Before Walt died he was  in the process of creating a  theme park greater than  Disneyland. However, Walt  was never able to see his  creation completed.  When Walt passed his  brother took on the  responsibility of finishing the  theme park. The park would  12  be located in Orlando,  Florida, and in 1971, Disney  World was opened.  Disney studio is still  creating popular movies that  Walt would be proud of,  such as Beauty and the  Beast, The Little Mermaid,  Brave, Tangled, Frozen, and  13  many more.  Walt Disney has touched  the lives of millions of  people! His legacy still  continues to this day, and he  will forever be in the hearts  of children and adults alike.  14  Glossary  Responsibility: being  accountable for something  within one's power, control, or  management.

They chose the Philadelphus Lewisii,  which was named after Meriwether  Lewis, the  discoverer of  the flower. The  Philadelphus  Lewisii is better  known as the  syringa flower. The syringa grows  generously in the hills and mountains  of Idaho’s terrain. The Syringa grows  best in moist soil along rocky areas,  4  dry ravines, and streams.  The Boise National Forest is most  abundant with the syringa flower  along Idaho’s rivers, simultaneously  with the Chinook salmon’s migrating  season.  The syringa flower is a woody  shrub with clumps of scented white  flowers that can grow as tall as 10  feet.  5  Chapter 2:  Poisonous  There are many wild flowers  native to Northern Idaho that  brighten up a dirt path or side of the  road during a leisure walk, but it is  important to know  the difference  between the safe  wild flowers and  the poisonous  wildflowers of  Idaho.  First off we have the Ranunculus,  or Buttercup flower, found in the  Idaho Panhandle National Forest and  many of the North Western states.  6  Although this flower looks dainty and  inviting, be cautious; the Buttercup,  also known as the Little Leaf  Buttercup, is very poisonous.  If you have ever walked through  the woods or gone on a hiking path in  Idaho, you have probably come  across a plant called Urtica Dioica,  otherwise known as Stinging Nettles.  This plant is  known for its  abundance in  the wet regions  of Idaho’s  forests and for  its memorable  stinging that comes after touching  the plant.  7  Although the blooming flowers  can be attractive in the sunlight,  remember the poisonous sting that  can come from them.  The Tanacetum Vulgare, or  Tansy, is one very common plant that  can likely grow in your backyard. The  Tansy is a widespread,  tall, aromatic herb that  grows abundantly in the  forests of Idaho. The  Tansy plant is poisonous  to animals and humans,  as the consumption of  the plant can cause  intestinal inflammations and even  spasms and convulsions.  8  Chapter 3:  Non-Poisonous  Amongst the poisonous plants in  Idaho, there are many wildflowers  that are both beautiful and safe for a  bouquet in your living room.  With a light pink and fuchsia  flower, the  Trifolium Pratense  most likely grows in  many Idahoans’  backyards. Referred  to as Cow grass at  times, the Red Clover’s flower, leaves,  and stem are all edible. If you are  relaxing outside and think you want a  little snack or to try something new,  9  pull the flowering leaves out of the  plant and suck on the bottom.  Native to  twelve states, the  Serviceberry  plant is common  across the forest  and foliage of the  Idaho terrain. The Serviceberry plant  blooms earlier than most plants and  provides the vast amount of food for  other native animals.  The serviceberry fruit and leaves  are both edible to animals and  humans. The fruit is close to what a  huckleberry would look like and close  in flavor as well.  10  Life Cycle of a Plant  11  Glossary  Philadelphus Lewisii: Also known as the  syringa, a deciduous shrub native to western  North America  Chinook Salmon: Largest species of Pacific  salmon. They live in Idaho, Oregon,  Washington, and other northern states.  Shrub: Woody plant that is smaller than a  tree and has several main stems.  Ranunculus: Plant such as the buttercup with  yellow or white flowers and lobed or toothed  leaves.

It  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  natural  forces  known  to  people.  4  How  Fire  Works  The  Basic  Elements  of  Fire:  Heat:  Starts  fire  by  removing  moisture  from  nearby  fuel.  Fuel:  Is  any  material  that  can  catch  fire  through  heat,  especially  when  it  lacks  moisture.  Air:  Oxygen  is  needed  to  spread  fires.  If  any  of  these  elements  are  missing,  a  fire  cannot  exist.  5  Types  of  Fire  Natural  Fires:  Help  our  ecosystem  by  replenishing  habitats.  Fire  promotes  plant  and  wildlife  diversity  by  burning  the  dead  materials  to  make  room  for  new  growth.  6  Prescribed  Fires:  Also  called  controlled  burns,  these  are  planned  fires  by  experts.  Sometimes  when  natural  fires  do  not  occur  as  often  in  certain  areas  there  is  a  build  up  of  dead  fuels,  and  prescribed  burns  are  crucial  and  good  for  the  habitat.  They  also  help  with  fire  prevention.  7  What  Causes  Wildland  Fires?  Wildland  fires  are  a  serious  threat  to  lives  and  property  in  the  U.S.  The  combination  of  drought,  warmer  temperatures,  high  winds  and  an  excess  of  dried  vegetation  in  forests  and  grasslands  have  made  fire  seasons  progressively  worse  over  the  past  50  years.  Causes  include  accumulation  of:  • Leaves,  branches,  excessive  plant  overgrowth  in  forest  and  wildland  areas  • Increasingly  dry,  hot  weather  • Changing  weather  patterns  across  the  U.S.  • Increased  residential  development  in the  wildland/urban  interface  8  Other  Causes  of  Fires:  Improper  Campfire  Trash  Lightning  Strikes  Hot  and  Dry  Climates  Can  you  identify  why?  9  Common  ways  YOU  could  unintentionally  start  a  wildfire:  • Unattended  debris  burning  • Equipment  fires  such  as  from  lawnmowers,  ATVs,  power  equipment  • Smoking  • Unattended  campfires  (photo  below)  • Fireworks  • Carelessly  discarding  fireplace  or  BBQ  ashes  10  What  You  Can  Do?  While  sometimes  caused  by  natural  occurrences  such  as  lightning,  nine  out  of  ten  wildfires  are  human-­‐caused.  Remember  to:  • Become  educated  on  wildland  fires  • Practice  safety  and  being  aware  of  your  surroundings  • Know  when  and  how  to  start  a  campfire  and  follow  proper  regulations  • Water  down  your  campfires  What  are  some  other  ways  to  prevent  wildand  fires?  11  Glossary  Wildland  Fires:  A  term  that  describes  unwanted,  unplanned,  damaging  fire  burning  in  forest,  shrub  or  grass  and  are  one  of  the  most  powerful  natural  forces  known  to  people.

Wind power captures the natural wind in our atmosphere and changes it into useable energy. Wind turbines (or windmills) have been around for centuries and have been able to convert wind into energy for multiple purposes. Some of these purposes include: pumping water, grinding grain, and lighting houses. There are a few different types of wind power. One type is called Utility-scale wind. This type of wind power generates electricity to power a large area of space, such as an entire community. The second type of wind power is called Distributed or “small” wind. This type of wind power provides enough energy and electricity to directly power something smaller such as a home. The third wind power type is called Offshore wind. This type of energy is created by wind turbines that are placed in large bodies of water around the world.  4  How Does Wind Energy Work?  Have you ever seen those huge propellers on a wind turbine? Well, those are large blades that capture energy when the wind blows and makes them rotate. These large blades are connected to a gearbox, which is a part of the wind turbine that increases the speed at which these large blades rotate. Wind turbines are interesting because they are equipped with equipment that will automatically rotate the large turbine into the direction the wind is blowing. The picture below shows you what the inside of a wind turbine looks like. Look inside! Isn’t it interesting to see the machinery that produces the wind energy?  5  Cost of Wind Turbines  Wind is a renewable resource, which is any natural resource that can replenish itself naturally over time. That means, that wind itself is a free resource that we use. The most expensive cost about wind energy is building the wind turbines. There are many different sizes of wind turbines, which effect the cost. Smaller turbines, such as one that would power a single home, cost less than a large turbine that you would see in farming fields. The price for a wind turbine can range from $10,000 to $70,000. The purchase price along with the installation price of a large turbine can cost up to $350,000. The picture below shows the many different sizes of wind turbines.  6  What Influences the Cost?  There are reasons as to why wind energy can be so expensive. The first reason is called capital costs, which is the cost of building, installing, and managing the turbines. The cost to build the wind turbines is the largest financial aspect of creating wind energy. The cost of installing the wind turbines is expensive too. It takes a lot of machines, workers, and time to correctly install a wind turbine. The good news is that even though it’s expensive, the American Wind Energy Association is reducing the total cost each year, making wind turbines a more affordable entity each year.  7  Benefits of Wind Turbines  Some of the benefits of wind turbines include:   Wind Turbines produce a clean fuel source.  o The nice thing about energy generated from wind turbines is that it doesn’t pollute the air!   Wind Turbines produce wind energy, which is sustainable, meaning able to be maintained.  o The nice thing about wind is that it never goes away! Wind will always be on earth, which will allow wind turbines to produce lots of energy.   Wind turbines can be built on farmland.  o Large flat lands such as farmland or ranches provide a lot of great space for wind turbines to be placed. The more turbines, the more wind energy!  8  Drawbacks of Wind Turbines  Some of the drawbacks of wind turbines include:   No wind, no wind power or energy.  o One of the difficulties with determining where to build a wind farm, a place designed to hold many wind turbines, is knowing how much wind a certain place will get. Sometimes, it hard to know which areas will receive a lot of wind. Without wind, there is no energy produced.   Turbine blades may harm wildlife.  o The blades on the wind turbine are so large, that sometimes wildlife such as birds fly into them and get badly injured.   Building wind turbines is expensive.  o As discussed earlier, wind turbines are not cheap to produce. Some cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to make and install!  9  Summary  In summary, wind turbines are very large machines that help produce wind energy by capturing the wind in our atmosphere and changing it into useable energy. Wind energy is produces when the large blades on the wind turbines turn when the wind is blowing, bringing the wind into a generator that converts the wind into a source of energy. Although wind turbines are expensive to build, engineers and builders are working together to lower the cost of building and installing these large machines each year. There are both benefits and drawbacks to wind turbines. A benefit being that wind turbines use a renewable resource to help create energy, and a drawback being that it’s hard to predict where the wind will be blowing. All in all, wind turbines are helping keep our world a greener place by providing the possibility to have clean, renewable and sustainable energy.  10  Glossary  Distributed or “small” wind: This type of wind power provides enough energy and electricity to directly power something smaller such as a home  Capital Costs: The cost of building, installing, and managing the turbines.
