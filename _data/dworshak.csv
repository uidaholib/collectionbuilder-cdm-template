Dworshak Dam Project 2 (Possible bridge sites),,"Possible bridge sites and relocated county road. Note on back: """"During the planning stages we wanted a bridge across the main river just below Ahsahka. It was to be an Army construction type of bridge and we were working with the State Highway  to get it to be a bridge for public use. Army wanted it to haul  cement and route for workers to come to the job- a saving for labor transportation, etc. The state was to put some money into it and make it a public bridge, the Army wanted to tear it down after construction. To make a long story short, the state was willing but the Army backed out of the deal and elected to divert the travel across the bridge at Orofino rather than go to the expense of a new bridge. The markings are Army. This shows the forks of the river well. (A.B.

Smoke, ri ing from the burning brush   and trees taken from the stripped slopes,   mingl and is lost in the mist. The   fire are the beginning of a $ 210- million   project which will change the economic   face of northern Idaho.   Dworshak Dam, 1% miles from Ah��sahka   on the North Fork of the Clear��water   River, promises to be the biggest   thing to happen in the Clearwater coun��try.   With the opening of bids Wednesday   at Walla Walla on the $ 4- million diver��sion   tunnel and fi h passage, the dam   will be on its way up. By 1972, the dam is   scheduled to be finished. Its power gen��erators   will harvest the kinetic energy of   free water and control flooding.   Orofino, the nearest incorporated town,   stands to gain population rapidly begin��ning   in 1965. Total employment at the   damsite i expected to hit 680 by the end   of next year. The peak will arrive in   1968, when 1,930 employes will be build��ing   the main part of the 673- foot- high   concrete dam. Mayor A. B. Curtis of   Orofino, who has worked for years to get   the dam authorized by Congress, esti��mate   Orofino will have 12,000- 15,000 peo��ple   during the construction compared with   the present 2,500.   It was a long and often frustrating   campaign to get the dam on the federal   government's construction list. Originally   it was to be Bruces Eddy Dam. The name   came from a point on the North Fork   where the dam will be. Bruce Lipscomb   To Award Contract   A 40- foot diameter diversion tunnel in   the contract to be awarded Wednesday   by the Army Corps of Engineers will be   built around the damsite- the first tangi��ble   construction. About 150 men will be   employed to build the tunnel through the   mountainside to handle the river flow un��til   the dam is completed. Several changes   in the specifications have been made   since the original drawings were com��pleted,   including a change in plans for   protecting migrating fish.   Work so far has been financed by an   $ 8.5- million appropriation for the 1964 fis��cal   year. Part of that went for a detour   road site clearing, and the diversion tun��nel.   Curtis said about $ l1- million will be   needed for the next fiscal year. And in   1967, when the prime contract for the   cofferdam and main dam will be let,   about $ 123- million will be needed.   First phase of brush and tree clearing   is scheduled to be finished by next week   by Hubner & Michner, Inc., Denver. Rock   work on the diversion tunnel probably   will begin soon after the contract is   awarded. Logs coming downriver in the   spring will pass through the diversion   tunnel, Curtis said, on their way to the   main Clearwater River and then to Lew��iston   mills.   The fish passage problem, which in��volves   salmon and steelhead swimming   upriver to spawn was a matter of con��cern   to wildlife experts and sportsmen   alike. In fact, the question of how to get   fish around dams anywhere - Brownlee,   Ice Harbor or Bonneville- has raised more   argument among laymen then anything   else.   The first plan announced by. Army   Engineers was to use a bucket system in   which a cable tramway would lift buckets   vertically to clear the upstream. coffer   dam crest and then 1,200 feet horizontally   to deposit the fish in the river upstream.   This kind of equipment was used at Ice   Harbor Dam.   Now the Corps has come up with   plan5, said Curtis, that call instead for a   catch basin which fish will be induced to   enter. Then they will be lifted to the top   of the dam and put in a 1,000- gallon   truck. Two trucks working in rotation will   take the fish six miles upstream and put   them back into the North Fork to con��tinue   their journey.   A fish hatchery also is being planned   by the federal government in the Peck��Lenore   area, Curtis said, to help stock   the pool behind the dam when it is fin��ished.   ate   wor~ k am S'il I- '"" v / ! h drowned there in 1887 while doing a   railroad location study, gave the point   its name. When Sen. Henry Dworshak, R��Idaho,   died in 1962, a successful effort to   change the name to Dworshak Dam   was begun in Congress, and the late   President John F.
