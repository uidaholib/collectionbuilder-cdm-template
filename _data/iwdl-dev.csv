Some limnological aspects of Spring Valley Reservoir,"Duff, Douglas Willard",1965-05,,"46.78, -116.76",limnology; reservoirs,"The present investigation is an attempt to contribute to our inadequate knowledge of limnological interrelationships in an artificial body of water. Spring  Valley Reservoir, a 56 acre artificial lake, was selected for study. Field work extended from May through November,  1964, but certain phases of the laboratory work were not completed until March, 1965.  Particular attention has been given to vertical and seasonal variations of zooplankton populations in reference to selected environmental factors such as temperature,  transparency, dissolved oxygen, free carbon dioxide, total and calcium hardness, alkalinity, nitrogen, and phosphorous. In addition, emphasis has been given to  the mean summer standing crop of zooplankton.  Although limnology has been recognized as a distinct branch of science for less than 70 years (Welch, 1952),  much has been done to provide an understanding of lake productivity and the numerous factors influencing productivity . Many investigations have been conducted in an  attempt to determine characteristics with which to classify the productivity of lakes. As a result, many physical,  chemical, and biological measures of productivity have evolved and are now used with varying degrees of success.  Some of these limnological methods have been included in the present investigation.",Palouse Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196501,iwdl-196501,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2007-12-08,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",Jodi Haire,,37
"Relationship of farm size to ability to pay for irrigation water in the dry lake area of Canyon County, Idaho","Coffing, Arthur Lee",1965-05,Boise River,"43.71, -116.76",irrigation; Idaho; Canyon County,"The main objective of the study is to determine the ability of different sizes of farms to pay for irrigation water. This ability will be measured by the capability of the farm to produce high value crops at low costs.  Phrased in a different way, the objective of this study is to find the maximum that farms of various sizes can pay for irrigation water if, at the same time, all other factors of production are adequately rewarded. This, to some degree, will indicate the maximum value of water if irrigation is its highest use. This type of information can be of use to future studies which involve water rights or water values.  A secondary objective is to determine the economies of size of the various enterprises.

A solid-liquid phase precipitation metering device,"Read, John Carlton",1966-06,,,precipitation,"A need for a precipitation metering device capable of discriminating between solid and liquid phases of precipitation initiated this research project.  A literature search revealed no existing instrument capable of performing this function; however, references were found to certain schemes which, with modifications, could possibly be adapted as a solution to this problem.  An optical scheme was selected for further research because this type of system requires no mechanical motion, thus avoiding icing problems likely to be encountered in the operational environment, and because luminous radiation and electricity are energy forms which are easily transducible from one form to the other.  A photosensitive device was used to determine the relative light attenuant and reflective effects of the precipitation particle types.  With certain geometric restrictions it was found that the reflective properties of snow are of a sufficient degree of magnitude greater than those of rain to enable the development of a system sensitive to the presence of snow and not rain. Optical attenuant characteristics of the snow and rain particles were found to be similar in degree of magnitude of photosensitive device response.  A prototype system employing both reflective and attenuant effects of the particles was developed and shown to be capable of detection and identification of both precipitation phases.  This system is recommended as a solution to this problem.",,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196603,iwdl-196603,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2008-04-24,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",Jodi Haire,,39

"The economic value of water in different uses within agriculture. Research technical completion report, project A-017-IDA","Maher, Matthew Joseph",1967-08,,,water use; irrigation water,"This study was undertaken in order to determine the economic value of water in alternative uses within agriculture in Idaho. It is important to Idaho farmers and to the economy of Idaho in general to have such estimates available so that maximum economic gains may be derived from the available supply of irrigation water.  Three irrigation areas, Area I, Area II, and Area III, along the Snake River valley were studied. Costs of producing different crops in those areas were already available from previous studies. The author interviewed selected farmers in two of those areas to update available information and to determine the resource supply situations confronting operators.  The analytical tool applied to fulfill the objectives was linear programming. Three representative farms of different sizes were constructed for Area I and one each for Areas II and III. Three analytical models were formulated as steps in attaining the objectives. Changes were made from model to model in order to make the analysis more realistic or to investigate some particular facet of the problem.   The results of the study indicate that the value of water varies from area to area, water being most valuable in Area I and least valuable in Area III. Analysis of different sized farms in Area I indicates that farmers can afford to pay more for water on large farms than on smaller farms.

New development: the Geiger-Muller radioisotope snow gage,"Waldron III, Harvey Macy",1967-05,,,radioactive snow gages,"Since about 1947, the use of radioactive isotopes has been known to be adaptable to the measurement of water contained in snow packs. Early investigations of these measurement techniques were unsuccessful because the Geiger-Muller detector, the detector readily available at that time, is a device incapable of energy discrimination.  Energy discrimination is achievable by the use of scintillation detectors resulting in the present use of these devices as radiation snow gages. However, the scintillation systems have the disadvantages of high cost and complex maintenance as compared to Geiger-Muller systems.  Mechanical energy discrimination, using collimation techniques, makes possible use of the non-energy discriminant Geiger-Muller systems for snow gaging. This paper discusses such a system that has been developed and tested. Design emphasis is placed on energy discrimination and electronic dead-time correction methods. Laboratory and field test data are presented to show predictable performance characteristics. All evidence to date indicates that the Geiger-Muller snow gage may be preferable, considering the combined aspects of accuracy and costs, to either the scintillation snow gage or the pressure pillow.

Field studies of existing seepage measurement techniques including ponding tests, inflow-outflow techniques and seepage meters were made. A new seepage meter which will operate efficiently in large operating canals was developed. An accurate and reliable tensiometer system for monitoring changes in soil moisture pressure beneath operating canals was developed. Measured decreases in soil moisture and pressure beneath an operating canal during the irrigation season indicated decreasing seepage rates caused by natural sealing of a thin soil layer on the canal bottom. A fast response, inexpensive null point tensiometer was laboratory tested and a device for measuring the capillary pressure - saturation curve for soils in situ was investigated.

Most distinctive microclimatic feature is the extreme development of nocturnal temperature inversions during summer and early autumn. Mean inversions between non-contiguous hilltops and bottomlands may reach 20 to 30 degrees. Greatest recorded on a specific day has been 42 degrees. Mean temperatures, length of frost-free season, nocturnal relative humidities, natural vegetation, and land use are all strongly influenced by these inversions. None of the six official Weather Bureau stations in the vicinity of the profile is located to show these inversions. Diurnal temperature and relative humidity patterns differ greatly at individual sites along the profile and are analyzed and compared.

A definite area known commonly as the Oakley Fan was selected as the site for analysis.   The author interviewed many of the farmers in the area in order to collect physical input and output information. This information was gathered for the years 1965, 66, & 67.   The analytical tools applied to fulfill the objectives were a synthetic budget approach in conjunction with a linear programming model. Such analysis depicted the structure of three sizes of typical farms in the area in contrast to three theoretical optimum farms.   The results of this study indicate that the farmers in the area are now relatively close to the theoretical optimum structure. Also, economies of size were found to the extent that the smaller farmers received approximately 50% less than the larger farmers for their return to management and water.

Studies on methods of soil moisture determination,"Hite, Howard Eugene",1968-04,,,soil water,"Though the need for instrumentation capable of determining soil moisture quickly and accurately has long been recognized, no dependable means suitable for automatic and remote soil moisture measurement has yet been developed. Presently, the only reliable method for measuring soil moisture is a time consuming process which requires human attention. Water is removed from a soil sample by heating, and the resultant weight loss is determined. Considerable work has been reported on a device which measures the electrical conductivity of a gypsum block imbedded in the soil. Water causes the electrical resistance of the block to decrease. These blocks are alleged to be unreliable under many field conditions. The work reported in this thesis was undertaken with the intent to develop a more reliable instrument for remote site operation. An extensive survey of the literature led to the selection of three fields of study: streaming potential, thermal conductivity and specific heat, and absorption of infrared radiation by moist soil.  Experimentation revealed that the factors controlling streaming potential were so diverse that isolation of soil moisture or moisture flow variables was not feasible in field applications.  An original thermal measuring device could be successfully and reliably used in certain ambient temperature ranges.  Certain wavelengths in the infrared spectrum are readily absorbed by moisture in the soil.

Horizontal dispersion and density of limnetic crustaceans in four sub-alpine lakes,"Wissmar, Robert Charles",1968-05,,"46.85, -115.49",Crustaceans,"Limnetic crustaceans from four subalpine lakes in northeast Idaho were studied during the summers of 1966 and 1967. Four methods were used to take quantitative vertical plankton samples. These collections were used for comparison of lakes, comparison of sampling methods within lakes, and comparison of sample sizes.   The four lakes were similar in having a simple species composition and low density of limnetic crustaceans. For all samples Fisher's coefficient of dispersion S2/X-bar was computed and used as a measure of horizontal dispersion. Mean total crustacean density and dispersion appeared to approximate taxa density and dispersions. Data for all comparisons were based on the density and horizontal dispersion of mean total crustaceans.   The meadow lakes had higher densities of limnetic crustaceans than the headwall lakes, 1966 and 1967. There was an indication that a positive linear relationship existed between total crustacean density and coefficient of dispersion when sampled by different methods in each of the four lakes. Similarities of total crustacean density and dispersion estimates from different methods and sample sizes was attributed to the low density in limnetic regions.

Relationship between farm size and ability to pay for irrigation water. Idaho agricultural research progress report no. 112,"Coffing, Arthur; Lindeborg, Karl H.",1966,Snake River,"43.46, -116.6",farms; water supply; irrigation,"This study was conducted in the Dry Lake area at Nampa, Idaho, where 5 or 6 companies are pumping irrigation water from the Snake River to a plateau 500 to 600 feet above the river surface. Irrigation development costs of bringing the water to the headgates of the farms are not included in this phase of the study.   Data was secured for 8 farms by interviewing each farm operator and land owner. To make comparisons between farms and also between enterprises, the data were broken down into per acre variable costs, fixed costs, total returns, net income and the cost of producing a dollar's worth of output. The term &quot;cost per dollar of output&quot; is the ratio of costs to returns. This ratio makes it possible to compare high-valued crops with low-valued crops on a per acre basis. This is a very sensitive measurement. For ex-ample, one cent change in the ratio for potato enterprise means a change in net income of $3.25 per acre.   The budgeting method of estimating water values in irrigation was used in this study. Long-run planning cost curves were estimated from the budgets by using simple curve linear regression. From the regression equations for each of the four enterprises (grain, sugar beets, potatoes and alfalfa seed), 12 model farms were constructed.   The long-run average total cost curve for the model farms, which incorporates a long-run rotation and long-run price and yield expectations, indicated economies of size up to a farm size of 2,400 acres.   Net income--the measurement of how much money is left over to pay for irrigation water after all expenses, including remuneration for management, land and investment, have been paid--varied from about $50 to $57 per acre for all model farms.",Boise Basin,Idaho agricultural research progress report,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,"Agricultural Experiment Station, University of Idaho, College of Agriculture",University of Idaho,eng,196602,iwdl-196602,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2008-01-17,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.08 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF; 1,785,426 bytes",jh,,60
"Geology and hydrogeology of the Albion Basin, Cassia County, Idaho","Myers, David Arthur",1967-05,Snake River,"42.41, -113.57",geology; geohydrology; Cassia County,"Albion basin is an alluvium-filled basin in eastern Cassia County, Idaho, about 18 miles southeast of Burley.   The study area is in the Basin and Range province of the western United States. The eastern boundary of the basin is formed by the Malta Range, a rotated fault block which apparently is bounded by high-angle normal faults on the east and west. A line of hot springs marks the probable position of the fault on the west side of the Malta Range. East Hills bounds the basin on the north and the main mass of Albion Range forms the south and west boundaries.  The Malta Range and part of the East Hills are made up of a thick flow of quartz latite. The flow consists of three zones: lower and upper vitrophyre zones, and a central lithoidal zone. No mineralogical differences and no physical breaks were noted between the zones. Capping the Malta Ridge in the north is a body of Snake River basalt about one square mile in area. The Albion Rage is underlain by metamorphic rocks.   Marsh Creek is the principal stream in the basin, but the ground water is the main source of irrigation and domestic water. Wells range in depth from 11 feet to more than 700 feet and yields range from a few gallons per minute to 540 gallons per minute. Wells must be cased the entire depth of penetration. Several clay lenses in the alluvium create local artesian aquifers. The water, mostly of the calcium-bicarbonate type, is suitable for domestic and irrigation use:  the total dissolved solids content ranges from 202 ppm. to 2294 ppm; temperatures of the waters in the deep wells are generally 62 degrees to 74 degrees Fahrenheit, and in the shallow wells, 57 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot springs in Marsh Canyon are used only for irrigation, although the possibility exists that they could be developed for domestic heating or for recreation.  Quantitative data on water resources could not be obtained from the present study, but available data suggest that the basin is not yet fully developed.",Boise Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196704,iwdl-196704,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2008-09-18,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF; 2,880,954 bytes",Jodi Haire,,61

Proceedings of the 6th annual Enginieering Geology & Soils Engineering Symposium","Jones, Robert W.; Ross, Sylvia H.; Williams, Roy E.",1968-04-18,,,recharge basins; intermittent streams; artificial recharge; Latah County,"The City of Moscow and the University of Idaho are the principal users of ground water in Moscow basin. Water is obtained from artesian aquifers in the basalt flows and interbedded sediments of the Columbia River Group.  From 1896 to the 1960s, all water was obtained from an artesian aquifer that is at a depth of about 250 feet. Water levels in the wells declined steadily over the years; the total decline at the city's pumping plant was about 100 feet by the 1960s.  The water in the aquifer is of poor quality because of high concentrations of iron.  Exploration for other ground water supplied led to the discovery of good quality water in productive aquifers at depths of 700 feet and 1300 feet.  The City and University shifted nearly all pumping to the deeper aquifers, and since heavy pumping ceased in the upper aquifer, water levels have been steadily rising.  Properties of the deeper aquifers are not yet known and the amount of water that they will yield over long periods of time is uncertain.  Strong possibility exists that the deeper aquifers will show a long-term decline of water levels, indicating depletion of the supply of ground water.  It is uncertain that projected future demands can be met by naturally-available ground water.  Import of surface water from outside the basin is costly due to distance, construction cost of pipeline, operation cost of high pumping lift.  Preliminary study indicates that artificial recharge of ground water by utilizing seasonal runoff from intermittent streams in and near Moscow basin is a feasible and cheaper alternative to long-distance importation of surface water.

The first approach was to estimate the economic value of water through cost function analysis. The value of water in this approach is a proportion of the cost of producing a dollar value of output. This approach does not yield the value of an incremental acre foot of water, but yields a weighted average of all the increments of water over the whole range of production.  The other approach of economic analysis was the application of linear programming in estimating the value of an incremental unit of water. Three irrigation areas along the Snake River were included in the study. Costs of producing different crops were computed and representative farms of the three areas were constructed. These farm operations were assumed to be typical of the areas, and under given resource allocation restrictions, the economic return to the input of water would indicate the value of an incremental unit of water in the production of agricultural products.",,,,"Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Coffing, A.

A survey of the literature led to the selection of four fields of study: streaming potential, thermal conductivity and specific heat, absorption of infrared radiation by moist soil, and some adaption of the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance.   Experimentation revealed that the factors controlling streaming potential were so diverse that isolation of soil moisture or moisture flow variables was not feasible in field applications. Extensive laboratory testing of an original thermal measuring device showed that this principle could be successfully and reliably used in certain ambient temperature ranges. The data also revealed that, when soil is partially frozen at 32 degrees F, information could be derived on the percentage of the soil water in the frozen state, provided the soil moisture content was known. Certain wavelengths in the infrared spectrum are readily absorbed by moisture in the soil. A prototype instrument which utilizes this phenomenon was fabricated. Certain problems in packaging the unit were encountered, but preliminary experimentation assured that this measuring technique shows promise and could be further developed.

In draft form, design documents are used to present proposed designs to reviewers. Reviewers are encouraged to submit suggested alternatives and comments to the design document. Reviewers include all members of the Eastern Snake Hydrologic Modeling (ESHM) Committee as well as selected experts outside of the committee. The design document author will consider all suggestions from reviewers, update the draft design document, and submit the design document to the SRPAM Model Upgrade Program Manager. The Program Manager will make a final decision regarding the technical design of the described component. The author will modify the design document and publish the document in its final form in .pdf format on the SRPAM Model Upgrade web site. Final model documentation will include all of the design documents, edited to ensure that the ""as-built"" condition is appropriately represented. The Eastern Snake Plain aquifer consists of a series of basalt flows with interlayered pyroclastic and sedimentary material. It extends across southern Idaho in a swath about 170 mi long and 60 mi wide. The Eastern Snake Plain aquifer encompasses the broad depression extending from King Hill in the southwest to Ashton in the northeast. Its lateral boundaries are formed by contacts with less permeable rocks at the margins of the plain.Numerous investigators have modeled all or parts of the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer. Two models of particular interest include one constructed by The University of Idaho for the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) described in Cosgrove and others (1999) and one by the U.S. Geological Survey (Garabedian, 1992). The Garabedian model was constructed largely as an investigative tool to explore concepts of regional ground water flow and improve scientific understanding of the aquifer. The IDWR model was designed primarily as an aquifer planning and management tool. The modeling effort this document supports, the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer Model Enhancement Project, was undertaken to facilitate conjunctive management of the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer. Thus, the model must necessarily represent both the Snake River and the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer as accurately as possible. The modeling process includes establishing calibration targets, identifying adjustable parameters, and quantifying known model inputs. For this effort, the calibration targets include aquifer water levels and Snake River reach gains and losses. The adjustable parameters include aquifer transmissivity, specific yield, and riverbed and drain conductance. The known inputs include precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface water irrigation, ground water pumping, seepage from rivers other than the Snake River, and underflow from tributary aquifers.",Boise Basin,ESPAM,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-ddm008_calibrept-1,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,ddm008_CalibRept-1.pdf,755

As part of the data-gathering process for preparation of the plan, the Board and its advisory group have requested an evaluation of the potential to benefit the aquifer by delivering additional surface water to lands that currently have bot a surface-water and a ground-water irrigation right. This practice has been called ""soft conversions."" Soft conversions are attractive on a practical basis because more of theinfrastructure to deliver surface water to the parcels may already be in place. They are attractive administratively because surface-water irrigation rights, often with relatively senior priority dates, are already in place. The legal authorith and ability to deliver water to these lands is more certain than for other uses of water that may benefit the aquifer. When additional surface water is delivered to soft conversions, the benefit is essentially doubled; the first benefit is that ground-water pumping for irrigation is reduced, and the seciond benefit is that incidental recharge from surface-water irrigation is increased. [...] The study addressed four fundamental questions: (1) How many of these mixed-source parcels (parcels with both surface-water and ground-water rights) are actually supplied only from ground water? (2) What is the degree and cost of infrastructure improvement needed to deliver surface water from existing canals to these parcels?

The ESPAM 1.1 model was calibrated in 6-month stress periods over the 1980-2001 period and model results were matched to both long term and seasonal variations in aquifer head and Snake River gains and losses. All recharge and discharge events and river stage are assumed constant for the length of a stress period, although aquifer heads may be computed at more frequent time steps. In ESPAM 1.1, the stress periods were selected as May through October (higher recharge irrigation season), and November through April (lower recharge non-irrigation season). Recharge and discharge data for each stress period are assembled and processed in the GIS-Fortran based Recharge Program which will work on stress periods of different lengths. In most cases recharge and discharge data and stream stage are available at a higher frequency than semi-annual periods. During model calibration the outputs of aquifer head and river gains and losses are compared to measured or estimated values. Estimates of the aquifer properties of transmissivity (or hydraulic conductivity) and storativity are adjusted to achieve a good fit between simulated and measured values. These property estimates subsequently control model results in simulations performed to guide aquifer management and administration. A more accurate description of recharge and discharge and river stage as model input should result in a better fit to historic measured values and improved calibration of aquifer properties, ultimately generating greater reliability of management and administrative simulation results. Since recharge, discharge, and river stage must be assumed constant during a stress period, it would seem that the shorter the stress period the more accurate the representation of reality. This is true to the extent that a) data are collected at short intervals, and b) there are not unknown or unrepresented elements of storage or lag in the system.",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200807,iwdl-200807,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200807.pdf,762

As discussed in analysis for ESPAM 1.1, Design Document DDW-024 (Erickson, Nelson, and Contor, 2004) some streams in the Snake River Plain that are perched are believed to be hydraulically contributing to the aquifer because of seepage. This design document describes perched river seepage from streams and other water bodies in the Eastern Snake Plain. Some surface water bodies that are represented in ESPAM 1.1 as perched are likely connected to the aquifer, which includes Mud Lake and parts of the Big Lost River and Camas Creek. These were not represented as hydraulically connected because simulating impacts to those water bodies was not part of the purpose of ESPAM 1.1. Because these are tributary to the regional aquifer, this doesn't change the water balance nor does it materially change the propagation of impacts to the Snake River or springs. These water bodies (Mud Lake, parts of the Big Lost River and Camas Creek, part of Twin Falls Canal, and Lake Murtaugh) will be simulated the same as they are in ESPAM 1.1 and will therefore not be discussed in this design document.

The second largest discharge from the aquifer is pumping for groundwater irrigation. The location and extent of irrigated lands is an important input to calculation of these components of the water budget. It is also necessary to correlate individual irrigated parcels to diversion and return data, and to various calculation and calibration parameters. This is done by assigning irrigated parcels to Irrigation Entities. Entities associated with surface-water sources are called Surface-water Irrigation Entities and entities associated with groundwater irrigation are called Groundwater Polygons.

ESPAM2 Design Document DDW-V2-01 As Built ''Canal Recharge''","Contor, Bryce A.",2009-10,Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer; Southern Idaho,,Aquifers; Computer models,"This report is a Design Document for the calibration of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer Model Version 2 (ESPAM 2). Its goals are similar to the goals of Design Documents for ESPAM 1.1: To provide full transparency of modeling data, decisions and calibration; and to seek input from representatives of various stakeholders so that the resulting product can be the best possible technical representation of the physical system (given constraints of time, funding and personnel). It is anticipated that for some topics, a single Design Document will serve these purposes prior to issuance of a final report. For other topics, a draft document will be followed by one or more revisions and a final ""as-built"" Design Document. Superseded Design Documents will be maintained in a ""superseded"" file folder on the project Website, and successive versions will be maintained in a ""current"" folder. This will provide additional documentation of project history and the development of ideas. As described in ESPAM1.1 Design Document DDW-020 (Contor, 2004), water that seeps from the bed of ditches and canals is direct recharge to the aquifer and is unavailable for delivery to farm fields1 (and therefore unavailable for crop evapotranspiration, return flows to the surface-water source, or in-field incidental recharge). Representation of recharge from canal seepage affects the spatial distribution of modeled recharge, but does not affect the mass balance of recharge or the aquifer water budget. This is because if the water were not applied to canal leakage, it would be applied as incidental recharge in the irrigated-lands calculations. If we adopt an On-Farm water budget methodology, representation of the canal seepage will alter the water budget. This Design Document outlines a proposal for treatment of recharge from canal seepage for ESPAM2. It is based on discussions in ESHMC meetings during the winter of 2007-2008 and e-mail communication from members. This is a draft document designed to describe the current proposal and solicit input.",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,200907_rev1,Idaho Department of Water Resources,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200907,iwdl-200907,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200907.pdf,779

This will provide additional documentation of project history and the development of ideas. This is Revision 1 of the October 2009 As-built document (Contor, 2009). Revision was necessary due to adjustments made to accommodate the On-Farm algorithm of recharge-calculation software MKMOD adopted by IDWR. As described in ESPAM1.1 Design Document DDW-020 (Contor, 2004), water that seeps from the bed of ditches and canals is direct recharge to the aquifer and is unavailable for delivery to farm fields1 (and therefore unavailable for crop evapotranspiration, return flows to the surface-water source, or in-field incidental recharge). In the ESPAM1.1 representation, as well as the previous ESPAM2 representation, recharge from canal seepage affected the spatial distribution of modeled recharge, but did not affect the mass balance of recharge or the aquifer water budget. With the adoption of the On-Farm algorithm, canal seepage is subtracted from gross diversions before the field-headgate delivery volume is calculated. Depending on the calculated adequacy of field-headgate deliveries, the On-Farm algorithm can change the water budget. With this realization, IWRRI proposed and the ESHMC concurred that a second look at canal seepage was necessary. This Design Document reports on the canal-seepage estimates that resulted from this attempt at refinement. Further data and discussion are posted by Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR, 2010a, 2010b).",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,200907,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200907_rev1,iwdl-200907_rev1,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200907_rev1.pdf,780

Since June 2009, Water District 01 (WD 01) and the IDWR Eastern office (also referred to as IDWR-Eastern) employees have continued the monitoring effort with some assistance from IWRRI. The Egin Lakes ponds are located near a Bureau of Land Management recreational site at the end of the Recharge Canal in southwestern Fremont County, approximately 11 miles west of the town of St. Anthony (Figure 1). Several designated monitoring wells and one private well were monitored during the recharge experiment. The study area has historically been considered a potential groundwater recharge site. Previous investigations have been conducted to determine the feasibility of recharge and benefit to the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (ESPA). These previous recharge studies along with the Fall 2008 recharge experiment are discussed in detail in the previous Egin report (Contor et al. 2009). The goal of this project was for WD 01 and IDWR employees to continue monitoring the managed recharge effort in the Egin Lakes study area. WD 01 and IDWR employees maintained a majority of the hand water level measurements in the wells measured during the most recent recharge experiment and measured flow in several canals. IWRRI periodically visited wells installed with transducers and downloaded the data. Bryce Contor of IWRRI spent some of his personal time measuring end of canal spill in the Egin area.

This will provide additional documentation of project history and the development of ideas. The ESPAM1.1 recharge tools and algorithms included three mechanisms for representing fluxes between the aquifer that could be represented as singlepoint fluxes into or out of the aquifer. These were the Fixed-point data set, the Scenario-point data set and the Offsite-point data set. The Fixed-point data set (intermediate file extension *.fpt) was designed to represent fluxes that did not enter into any other water-budget calculation. In ESPAM1.1 it was used for various components in the calibration water-budget, as described below. The recharge tools simply added the values to the volume for the appropriate model grid cell and stress period, without performing calculations. Since the MODFLOW code represents all fluxes into or out of the aquifer as if they occurred exactly and only at the center of the model cell, a point data set can reasonably used for any flux that occurs, even if in reality it is spatially distributed. The Scenario-point data set (intermediate file extension *.scn) was also designed to represent fluxes that did not enter into any other water-budget calculations, but was intended specifically for hypothetical fluxes that might be considered in applying the model to scenarios to investigate hydrologic or management questions. Its treatment in the recharge tools and algorithms was identical to the Fixed-point data set, but it was not used in calibration of ESPAM1.1. The Offsite-pumping data set (intermediate file extension *.off) was designed to represent pumping from wells that were distant from the irrigated place of use, where the water was not part of diversion data included in the diversions data sets. The calculation algorithms applied this water as a pumping withdrawal and also included it in canal-seepage and irrigated-lands calculations. The Fixed-point and Offsite-point data sets are retained in ESPAM2 waterbudget calculations, with essentially the same roles and definitions. This design document describes the particular water-budget components represented using these data sets and the details of the calculations.",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201005,iwdl-201005,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,201005.pdf,783
