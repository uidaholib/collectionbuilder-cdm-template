'• ' ,,  A Preliminary Cl.assificati ~on of  Snake River Canyon Grasslands in Idaho  E. W. Tisdale  INTRODUCTION  The grasslands of the Middle Snake River Valley con­stitute,  along with those of major tributaries such as the  Salmon and Clearwater, a unique and important vegeta­tion  region of Idaho. The total area occupied by these  grasslands in Idaho is about 486,000 hectares (I .2  million acres), perhaps half of which occurs in the area  included in the 12resent study. Similar grasslands occur  on the west side of the Snake River in Oregon and  Washington.  Due to its rugged topography, dry climate and stony  soils, most of this grassland region has remained un­cultivated.  A mild winter climate and high quality  forage provide choice grazing for both domestic  livestock and wildlife. The grasslands stabilize steep  slopes where accelerated erosion would be disastrous to  water quality in the Snake River system. Recreational  values are also high - much of the study area has  recently been designated the Hells Canyon National  Recreation Area.  These grasslands were used primarily by wildlife,  before the coming of white settlers, although by the late  1800s horses acquired by the Nez Perce Tribe were  The author is Professor Emeritus of Range Management with the  College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, University of [daho.

White settlement became widespread after  1870, introducing large herds of cattle and shee·p which  often were grazed on a yearlong basis (Evans 1967).  Most of the more accessible grassland became depleted .  While much remains so at the present time, difficult  access, precipitous slopes and lack of water have acted  to protect some areas from overuse. Better range  management has improved others. As a result, the study  area contains numerous examples of relatively un­disturbed  vegetation, particularly in the central portion,  where white settlement was sparse and heavy livestock  use was restricted to lands close to homesteads.  The study area includes the main valley of the Snake  and its immediate tributaries from the area around  Lewiston in the north to Brownlee Dam at the south end  (Fig. l ). Included are portions of Nez Perce, Idaho,  Adams and Washington counties in Idaho; Whitman  and Asotin in Washington; and Wallowa and Baker in  Oregon. Most of the study was conducted in Idaho; a  few sites were sampled and observations made in the  other two states.  The total length of this area is about 192 km ( 120  miles); the width varies from about 2 to 25 km ( 1.2 to  15 .5 miles). The topography is rugged, with elevation  ranging from a low of 214m (700ft) on the valley floor  near Lewiston to 2800 m (9185 ft) on the mountains for­ming  the canyon rim. Grasslands occur from the valley  floor to elevations of about 2400 m (7870 ft), but are  f:l --niver ityotldaho  ENTERPRISE •  OREGON  45'  IDAHO  SCALE  20 30 40 50 Km  Fig. I .

Parts of the canyon have steep rock walls,  but generally the valley sides rise in a series of slopes  ranging from 20 to over l 00 percent gradient. The ma­jority  of grassland slopes have gradients of 50 to 75 per­cent  (Fig. 2).  Climatic data are limited to stations at Lewiston and  Brownlee Dam. Both stations are located near the valley  bottom. Mean annual precipitation and temperature  data for these stations are presented below.

No data are  available for intermediate points in the canyon.  The moisture pattern is characterized by a high  percentage of winter precipitation, mainly in the form of  rain. Mild winter climate is shown by the relatively high  mean temperatures for January, and by the presence of  disjuncts such as Celtis reticulata (hackberry), a species  found primarily in the southwestern states.  The soils of the area are derived primarily from  Columbja River basalt or the older Seven Devils  volcanics~ along with varying amounts of quaternary  loess. Recent alluvial deposits are found in limited areas  on stream fans and terraces. Most of the grassland soils  have formed on relatively steep slopes and contain a  mixture of residual and colluvial materials. The soils are  relatively stony, and depth varies greatly with aspect and  slope. Textures range from loamy-sand to clay loam,  with loams and silt loams most common. Taxonomical­ly,  loamy-skeletal Argixerolls and Haploxerolls  predominate (Barker 1976, 1978; Soil Conservation Ser­vice  1975).  The vegetation of the study area consists mainly of  grassland at the lower and middle elevations, with con­iferous  forest above. There is much interfingering of  forest and grassland, however, due to differences in  aspect. Communities dominated by shrubby species in­cluding  Cercocarpus ledzfolius (curlleaf mountain  mahogany), Celtis reticulata, Amelanchier alnzfolia (ser­viceberry)  and Prunus emarginata (bitter cherry) occupy  limited areas in the canyon. A narrow band of riparian  vegetation along the river and its tributaries is  dominated by Alnus rhombifolia (white alder) (Miller  and Johnson 1976).  The southern end of the study area lies in the ecotone  between the Pacific Northwest bunchgrass region and  the sagebrush-grass or sagebrush steppe region.  PREVIOUS STUD~ IES  Little published information exists on the vegetation  of the study area or of the canyon grasslands of the  Pacific Northwest. Daubenmire's (1970) detailed study  of the steppe vegetation of Washington covers the  Palouse and Columbia Basin areas but not the canyon  of the Snake River or its tributaries. Daubenmire  described several habitat types dominated by either  Agropyron spicatum or Festuca idahoensis. Most infor­mation  relating directly to the study area occurs in  theses and papers from the University of Idaho.  Campbell ( 1962) studied vegetation dominated by F.  idahoensis at the northern end. On a basis of very limited  sampling he described two climax communities:  Agropyron spicatum/ Festuca idahoensis and Festuca  idahoensis/ Koeleria cristata. Evans (1967) and Evans  and Tisdale ( 1972) reported on studies of lower eleva­tion  grasslands, mainly in the Salmon River drainage.  Emphasis was on the ecology of A. spicatum and  A ristida longiseta (three awn). Two sera! communities  based on soil differences were recognized, both in the A.  spicatum series. Huschle (1975) was primarily concerned  with a narrow strip of land immediately adjacent to the  Snake River, but his studies included some upland  vegetation. Although most of his sites were in depleted  condition, he described a climax Agropyron  spicatum/ Poa sandbergii community which appeared  more mesic than that recognized by Daubenmire (1970)  in Washington.  Fig. 2. Typical rough topography and grassland vegetation of theM id­dle  Snake River Canyon. Soils and vegetation are weJI developed on  steep slopes (foreground), but considerable bare rock outcrop occurs,  especially on south slopes (background).  METI-IODS  Field methods were designed for rapid sampling with  reasonable accuracy, and required only simple,  lightweight equipment. Most of the sites were reached  by extensive foot travel. A jet boat was used to reach  portions of the canyon not accessible by road.  Sampling was concentrated on areas selected to repre­sent  different portions of the study region. Criteria for  sample areas included a range of topographic situations  and soil types plus stands of vegetation in relatively un­disturbed  condition. Suitable areas were found in the  vicinity of Waha in the northern part, Sheep Creek in  the central part, and near the south end of the study  area.  Sampling involved the use of a macroplot for record­ing  general site characteristics and microplots for  detailed study of vegetation and soil surface features. A  macroplot of 15 by 30m (50 by 100ft) was used, with 20  microplots, each 2 by 5 dm (8 by 20 inches) in size. These  Table l.

The microplots were  located at 2 m (6.5 ft) intervals along two randomly  selected transects . Plot locations were marked by  painted boulders or rock mounds and located on maps  and aerial photographs.  Physiographic data included elevation, aspect, per­cent  slope, and position on slope. Notes were made on  amount of erosion, signs of present and past grazing use,  and evidence of fire or other disturbance.  The soil profiles on each macroplot were exposed for  study with a pit. Parent material, profile development,  stoniness, solum depth , restrictive layers, etc. were  recorded. Samples were taken to determine texture, pH,  organic matter and color. Classification and  nomenclature were based on the U.S.D .A. Soil Tax­onomy  Handbook (Soil Conservation Service l975).  Data obtained from the microplots included frequen­cy  of rooted vascular species, an estimate of their foliage  cover, and the percentage of cryptogams, litter, gravel  and bare ground on the soil surface. A species list was  made by inspecting the whole macroplot and adding  species present but not recorded on the microplots . Her­barium  specimens were coJiected for documentation,  with nomenclature based on Hitchcock and Cronquist  (1973).  Analysis of the data included preparation of associa­tion  tables and statistical treatment. The first order sort­ing  by cluster analysis was based on species presence or  absence, following which quantitative factors of fre­quency  and cover were considered. Classification was  based on the vegetation, but soils and physiographic  data. were correlated with vegetation and incorporated  Table 2. Ve getational and site characteristics of gra ssland habitat types.  into the description of each community . Soils were  classified to family and, where possible, to series levels.  In recognizing communities, it was realized that the  vegetation of an area represents a continuum within  which groupings of similar stands can enhance un­derstanding  of ecosystems . In practice, physiographic  differences, especiaHy aspect, produced reasonably  sharp boundaries for the communities recognized.  Forty-seven stands were sampled during the field  seasons of 1976 and 1977. Additional data were ob­tained  from 14 sites established earlier by Campbell  (l962) and Evans ( 1967). A summary of results is  presented in Tables 1 and 2. Analyses of these data in­dicate  the presence of two vegetational series . The series  is a group of vegetation systems, usually with a single  dominant climax species. It corresponds to the term  ""vegetation zone"" used by many workers. The Festuca  idahoensis and Agropyron spicatum series recognized in  the present study belong in the Pacific Northwest  bunchgrass region.  Vegetational series are useful as a broad classification ,  but the objective in the present study is recognition of  finer units. The habitat type is considered the basic  ecosystem unit, defined as '""the aggregate of all areas  that support or can support the same primary climax""  (Daubenmire 1970) . The habitat type (ht) has relatively  uniform biotic and abiotic structure and is a primary  unit for management. The climax vegetation, considered  to gi ve the most meaningful integration of environmen­tal  factors .affecting vegetation , provides recognition  features for habitat types (Steele et al. 1976 , Hironaka  1977).

The elevational range of sites  sampled is from 540 to 1430 m ( 1770 to 4690 ft), but the  type at the lower elevations is confined to northerly  slopes. The series also extends to higher elevations. The  vegetation is characterized by the dominance of Festuca  idahoensis. Other common perennial grasses include  Agropyron spicatum , Koeleria cristata and Poa  sandbergii. A. spicatum is the most abundant of these  and is co-dominant with F. idahoensis in some cases.  Perennial forbs are abundant, with Achillea millefolium  var. lanulosa. Balsamorhiza sagittata. Brodiaea  douglasii. Castilleja hispida, L;thophragma parviflora,  Lomatium triternatum, Lupinus laxiflorus (spur lupine)  and L. sericeus most common. Annuals are less com­mon,  the only species with high constancy being a grass,  Bromus brizaeformis. and two dwarf forbs, Draba verna  and Stel/aria nitens.  The soils have A horizons which are deep and dark  colored with an organic content of 4 percent or more in  the surface 20 em (8 inches). Most belong in the loamy­skeletal,  mixed, mesic Pachic Ultic or Ultic Argixerolls.  These well drained soils are dry in summer, but store  considerable moisture in the winter months. Dwarf  cryptogams and litter comprise most of the soil cover,  while gravel or rock and bare ground constitute much  smaller portions.  This series provides high quality forage best suited for  summer and fall use. It is relatively resistant to overgraz­ing,  · but with continued overuse the cover of perennial  grasses and many perennial forbs is reduced, while an~  nuals and some perennial forbs increase.  HABITAT TYPES - FESTUCA SERIES  Festuca idahoensisj Koeleria cristata ht  This is the principal habitat type of the Festuca series  in the study area. The vegetation is characterized by  dominance of F. idahoensis and constant occurrence of  Koeleria cristata. Agropyron spicatum is usually present  and often abundant, but with less cover than the F.  idahoensis. Perennial forbs constitute about 25 percent  of the total cover, with Achillea millefolium, Castilleja  hispida, Lithophragma parv{flora, Hieracium albertinum,  Balsamorhiza sagittata and Ca!ochortus elegans most  common. Shrubs are represented only by Spireaea  betulifolia (shinyleaf spiraea) which occurs sparingly.  The soils are dark, with an average organic content of  7 percent. Most belong to the Lawyer series, ~ loamy­skeletal,  mixed, mesic Pachic Ultic Argixeroll, or to an  undescribed series which resembles Bluesprin, but is  darker and contains more organic matter. These  categories indicate relatively moist, cool conditions for  grassland soils, and correspond with the mesic nature of  the vegetation and the dominance of F. idahoensis. The  soil cover of dwarf cyptogams (lichens and mosses) and  litter is almost complete.  Festuca idahoensis / Koe/eria cristata represents a  habitat type not presently described in the published  literature, although Campbell (1962) used the term for  one of the communities described. It differs from any of  the habitat types described by Daubenmire ( 1970) in  eastern Washington.  This habitat type is highly productive and well suited  for summer and fall grazing. It is fairly resistant to  heavy grazing, but less palatable forbs such as A chi/Lea  mi/lefolium and annuals increase with continued  overuse.  Festuca idahoensis/ Agropyron spicatum ht  This type occurs mainly in the drier parts of the study  area, at the north and south ends, usually on similar  aspects but slightly lower elevations than the Festuca  idahoensis/ Koeleria cristata.  The vegetation is characterized by the shared  dominance of F. idahoensis and A. spicatum, virtual  absence of K. cristata, and by a lesser forb composition  and cover than that of the Festuca/ Koeleria. A  characteristic forb is Heuchera cylindrica, uncommon  elsewhere in the series. Shrubs are rare or lacking. The  soil cover of litter and cryptogams is comparable to that  in the Festuca j Koeleria, but gravel cover is higher.  Soils differ from those of the Festucaj Koeleria mainly  in having lower organic content and lighter color. They  belong mostly in the loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Ultic  or Lithic Ultic Argixerolls, but vary considerably.  Classification to series level has proved difficult to date,  although soils resembling Bluesprin, Riggins and even  Lawyer occur.  This community resembles jn some respects the  Agropyron spicatum/ Festuca idahoensis ht of Dauben­mire  ( 1970), yet differs considerably in species composi­tion.  H euchera cylindrica, Balsamorhiza sagittal a and  Eriogonum heracleoides, all common in the Festuca  idahoensis/ Agropyron spicatum, are lacking in Dauben­mire's  Agropyron spicatum/ Festuca idahoensis. On the  other hand, Phlox long1folia and annuals such as Plan­tago  patagonica (Indian-wheat) and Festuca pacifica  (small fescue) are much more common in Daubenmire's  type. Differences also occur in physiography and soils,  for Daubenmire's sites are mainly of gentle topography  with deep Joessial soils.  Festuca idahoensis / Symphoricarpos a/bus ht  This habitat type is confined to the northern end of  the study area, and sampling to date has been minimal  (4 stands). It occurs at middle elevations in the Festuca  series, on similar aspects to the Festuca idahoen­sis/  Koeleria cristata ht.  Vegetationally it is closest to the Festucaj Koeleria,  but differs in the presence of Symphoricarpos a/bus and  Rosa (nutkanafwoodsii), in the higher proportion of  Agropyron spicatum and in the less consistent occurence  of K. cristata. The soils are shallower, stonier, lower in  organic matter, and lighter in color than those of the  Festucaf Koeleria. They seem closest to a dark phase of  Bluesprin, which is a loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Ultic  Argixeroll.  The presence of Symphoricarpos and Rosa might  suggest a more mesic community than the  Festuca/ Koeleria, but the weight of evidence from  vegetation and soils indicates the opposite. This type  differs from the Festuca idahoensis/ Symphoricarpos  a/bus ht of Daubenmire (1970), which exceeds it greatly  in number and abundance of perennial forbs, as well as  in depth and fertility of soil.  AGROPYRON SERIES  These communities occupy the largest portion of the  canyon grasslands, extending from valley bottoms to  elevations of about 1350 m (4430 ft). At higher  elevations they become increasingly confined to souther­ly  slopes and ridge tops.  The vegetation is characterized by the dominance of  Agropyron spicatum. The only other perennial grass of  high constancy, Poa sandbergii, usually constitutes only  a small part of the perennial grass cover. Annual  grasses, especially the bromes, occur commonly but with  little cover. A large number of perennial [orbs occur, but  few species exhibit high constancy. The average number  of perennial forb species per site is only two-thirds that  of the Festuca series. The most common forbs are  A chi Ilea millefolium, Balsamorhiza sagittata, Lomatium  triternatum, and Phlox spp. (P. colubrina and P.  longtfolia).  Annual forbs are relatively sparse, the main species  being Draba verna, Stellaria nitens and Myosotis spp.  (forget-me-not). A succulent, Opuntia polyacantha, is  common in one habitat type. Shrubs are sparse, with  Chrysothamnus nauseosus (rubber rabbitbrush) most  common. Soil cover consists of a low content of dwarf  cryptogams, moderate to dense litter, and a large  amount of surface gravel in one habitat type.  The soils are lighter colored, with lower organic con­tent,  more stones, and shallower horizons than those of  the Festuca series. Most are loamy-skeletal, mixed,  mesic Argixerolls, Haploxerolls or Xerorthents in~  dicating moisture and temperature conditions less  favorable than those in the Festuca series.  This grassland is suited for fall and winter grazing and  can also be utilized in the spring if use is not continued  too long into the growing season. It is more easily dis­turbed  by heavy use than the Festuca series. Depleti0n is  shown by a decline in most perennials, especially  Agropyron spicatum, and by a marked increase in an­nuals,  including Bromus tectorum, other bromes and an­nual  forbs.  HABITAT TYPES- AGROPYRON SERIES  Agropyron spicatum/ Poa sandbergii (Idaho) ht  This habitat type is given the term ""Idaho"" to dis­tinguish  it from the Agropyron/ Poa described by  Daubenmire (1970). The ""Idaho"" type possesses a larger  number and greater total frequency of perennial forbs  than Daubenmire's habitat type. The more mesic annual  bromes, i.e. Bromus brizaeformis and B. japonicus. occur  commonly, but are rare or lacking in Daubenmire's  community. Huschle (1975) describes a similar  difference in annual brome species in samples of  Agropyron/ Poa in the middle Snake River Canyon. The  Agropyron/ Poa (Idaho) ht occurs throughout the study  area on slopes of relatively favorable aspect and on  deeper, less stony soils.  The vegetation is characterized by dominance and  abundant cover of A. spicatum, with P. sandbergii the  main ""filler"" species. A chil/ea mille folium, Balsamorhiza  sagittata, Phlox spp. ( P. colubrina and P. longifolia),  Lomatium triternatum and Brodiaea douglasii are the  most common perennial forbs. Shrubs are uncommon.  The ground surface is occupied mainly by litter and  dwarf cryptogams.  The soils are loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Calcic or  Ultic Argixerolls, most belonging to the Ta.1nahill series  or to one not yet named which shows some characters  resembling Bluesprin. These moderately deep soils  provide favorable growth conditions during the spring  months. Organic matter of the surface 20 dcm (8 inches)  averages just over 3 percent and the dry color of the A  horizon is dark grayish brown.  This is the most productive habitat type of the  Agropyron series.  Agropyron spicatum/ Opuntia polyacantha ht  This community occurs throughout the range of the  Agropyron series, but on drier sites, with more southerly  aspects than those occupied by the Agropyron  spicatum/ Poa sandbergii (Idaho) ht.  The vegetation is characterized by dominance of A.  spicatum, but with less cover than in the Agropyron/ Poa  ht. Poa sandbergii is sparse in cover and occasionally  absent. The perennial forb cover is less than that of the  Agropyron/ Poa and different in composition. The  characteristic species, Opuntia polyacantha, Phacelia  heterophylla and Scutellaria angustifolia, belong to a  group associated with gravelly sites. The soil surface is  dominated by a gravel pavement which usually covers as  much area as cryptogams and litter combined.  The soils are shallower, stonier, lower in organic  matter and lighter in color than those of the  Agropyron/ Poa (Idaho) ht. Most are loamy-skeletal,  mixed, mesic Lithic Haploxerolls or Lithic Xerorthents  of the Lick skillet and Bakeoven series, respectively.  These are shallow, stony soils and constitute the poorest  sites for plant growth in the grassland area. Soils with  slightly deeper profiles also occur in this habitat type;  some of them resemble a shallow phase of Tannahill  series. The Agropyron/ Opuntia ht occupies the most  xeric aspects with the Agropyron series, and produces  less plant cover than the Agropyron/ Poa ht.  DISCUSSION  Within the confines of regional climate, topographic  variation constitutes the major ecological influence in  the study area. Aspect, and to a lesser degree elevation,  strongly inflence mjcroclimate and hence the nature of  vegetation and soils. Steepness of slope appears to be a  lesser factor, at least up to the 75 percent limit set for  sampling in this study. Response to topographic varia­tion  has produced a mosaic of vegetation and soil types,  recognizable in the field and separable as taxonomic un­its.  One of the major objects of the current study is to in­vestigate  the relation between vegetation and soil units,  particularly at the level of habitat type and soil series.  Since vegetation and soils are developed by the same set  of formative factors (Jenny l958), there should be a  close relationship. It is not total, however, for although  vegetation and soils develop together, they do not  directly determine one another (Major 1951 ). Further­more,  the taxonomic units of each are based on their  own characteristics, thus the properties used to separate  two soil series may not be critical for the vegetation of a  particular area.  Despite these reservations, significant correspondence  of vegetation and soils is shown in the present study.  Relationship between habitat types and soil series is well  marked for the two major habitat types, Festuca  idahoensis / Koeleria cristata and Agropyron  spicatum/ Poa sandbergii (Idaho). In each case, two  closely related soil series are found conjoined with a  specific habitat type. The lesser degree of correlation for  the other three habitat types indicates a need for further  examination of both vegetation and soils of the areas in­volved  . A weakness of the present study has been lack of  joint field examination of vegetation and soils by  specialists in each of these disciplines. Identification of  soils from the study sites has been made on the basis of  my brief descriptions and from soil samples. The soil  surveys applicable to the study area were made at the  reconnaissance level and did not cover all units of  landscape, especially on the steep and relatively in­accessible  areas which contain much of the Snake River  grasslands.  I hope that this initial classification and description of  the principal grassland communities will be useful to  land managers and others concerned with the vegetation  of the area. Feedback and tests of these keys and  descriptions are needed to develop a more comprehen­sive  treatment of these canyon grasslands.

Sanders  Professor  Presented at 2nd Annual North Central Idaho Grazing Conference  January 26, 2006  Kenneth D. Sanders Department of Rangeland Ecology and Management University of Idaho  Why monitor?  Monitoring is the very basis of management for any business. We set objectives, develop a man-agement plan to meet those objectives, then moni-tor to determine whether the objectives are being met and if not, why. The Society for Range Man-agement (SRM, 1998) defines range monitoring as, ""The orderly collection, analysis and interpreta-tion of resource data to evaluate progress toward meeting management objectives. This process must be conducted over time in order to determine whether or not management objectives are being met."" Monitoring must also identify what areas of management need revision to produce the desired objective. We cannot make effective management decisions if we do not know the effect of past man-agement actions.  Although this guide is designed for use by pub-lic land livestock permittees, it is just as important that ranchers monitor their private rangeland too. A primary goal of both public and private land man-agers/owners is to insure the sustainability of ran-geland resources and the use of those resources, including their productive capacity. The monitoring plan is as important a part of the ranch/allotment plan as the grazing system or stocking rate. The objectives, sampling techniques, study locations, monitoring responsibilities and time tables for mon-itoring should be as detailed as possible.  Who should monitor?  As ranch or allotment management plans (AMPs) are developed, a detailed monitoring plan should also be developed. Just as AMPs on public land allotments should be a cooperative, coordi-nated plan developed by the agencies and permit-tees, so should the monitoring plan. Both the per-mittees and the agencies can benefit from a coop-erative effort. In most cases, a permittee may be interested in acquiring some, but not all the moni-toring information or data that the federal agencies desire. Collecting the same kind of information at the same time is an inefficient duplication of effort. By working together, more monitoring can be ac-complished and better decisions made.  The two most important factors in effective rangeland monitoring are: (1) the commitment to diligent monitoring and (2) the interpretation of the monitoring information that is collected. Permittees are on the allotment much more often than agency personnel, thus they are key to meeting both fac-tors. Monitoring methods that require frequent data collection, such as photographs, are best done by the permittees. Even more important, permittees are likely to observe events that may be critical to the proper interpretation of monitoring data, such as an unusual storm event or insect invasion.  The degree of commitment will vary by permit-tee; each permittee should only commit to those monitoring elements that they are realistically will-ing to accomplish. However, all permittees should at least become familiar with the location of the monitoring sites and types of information being collected. In some cases the permittees may be able and willing to monitor additional sites, using the established methodology, thus adding to the data base and increasing its accuracy. Monitoring is a long-term commitment but it should result in more effective management.  Adaptive management  In recent years the U.S. Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have started using the term adaptive management in their monitoring and management documents. Adaptive management is defined as the process of adjusting management strategies based on monitoring results. While this is really what man-agement has always been about, there appears to be a new-found willingness of public land agencies to use this process. Currently, there is a window of opportunity for permittees to be involved in provid-ing monitoring information to the agencies, being involved in the interpretation of monitoring data and, most importantly, having input in grazing management adjustments to meet the goals and objectives of both the agencies and the permittees. It is up to the permittees to take advantage of this opportunity.  Historical use records  Past-use records on your ranch/allotment can be very beneficial when developing a grazing management plan or monitoring present and future 2 A Rancher‘s Guide to Monitoring Rangelands  trends. Historical use records are important for determining long-term carrying capacity, range readiness, potential of various range sites and interpretation of monitoring data. When looking for this information, try to answer the following ques-tions:  Are there previous grazing management plans for your ranch/allotment?   When and by whom?   Still in use? If so, is it still effective?   What changes have been made? If any, why?   Have stockwater facilities and fences been changed? When and why?   Is there old monitoring data available?  Has the stocking rate been adjusted in the past?   When? Before or after you became a per-mittee?   Was the stocking rate higher or lower? Why was it adjusted?   What class and kind of livestock have grazed in the past?  What problems have been encountered on the allotment?   Livestock trespassing from adjoining allot-ments   Damage to the resources from other users; e.g. recreational use   Gates left open or fences knocked down by others, resulting in your livestock being in the wrong pasture   Poisonous plant problems that may limit when a pasture can be used   Insects, rodents or invasive species that may have affected allotment condition  What range improvements projects have been completed and when?   Was the improvement successful and still functional?   Are there maintenance problems beyond your control?   What agreements were made on mainten-ance responsibility?  Are there more or less wildlife numbers than in the past?   Have hunting seasons changed?   Are there problems with the time and dura-tion of the seasons?   Has there been wildlife damage to re-sources and/or improvements?   What is the wildlife utilization before and after your livestock have grazed a pasture?   Other factors that may have affected popu-lations?  Do you have old photographs of your allotment or ranch that can be compared with current conditions to show historical range trend?   Family photos showing the landscape in the background   Other photos with identifiable terrain or ve-getation in the background  Climate and weather data  Climate and weather data are essential for the interpretation of other monitoring studies. Precipita-tion records in particular should be kept on an al-lotment or pasture basis because of local variation. Maintenance of weather records is one of the ea-siest and most useful contributions a permittee can make in monitoring an allotment. Precipitation records obtained from rain gauges located near gates can easily be recorded on a periodic basis. The agencies may supply rain gauges in return for such data. Other climatic data of importance:   Temperature, unusual freezes   Flash floods; especially those that damage streambanks   Snow depth and persistence that might be a potential source of water   Patterns of storms over the allotment  Actual use  The agencies require each permittee to submit actual use at the end of the grazing season. These records are not only for billing purposes but are also used in evaluating grazing management and trend on allotments. It is essential that the permit-tee maintain accurate records of numbers, kind, class and age of livestock by date of grazing in each pasture. The agencies may provide a form to record this information. Ranchers should also maintain their own long-term records of actual use Kenneth D. Sanders 3  by date and pasture. These records may prove useful several years after the use occurred.  Rangeland health  Rangeland health is defined as, ―The degree to which the integrity of the soil, the vegetation, the water and air as well as the ecological processes of the rangeland ecosystem is balanced and sus-tained. Integrity is defined as: Maintenance of the structure and functional attributes characteristic of a particular locale, including normal variability (SRM, 1998).‖ This term replaces the terms ‗range condition‘ and ‗ecological status‘ that have been used in the past by the federal agencies.  The agencies are required to periodically as-sess rangeland health for reporting purposes. In addition to reporting requirements, rangeland health assessments are used to set management goals. Permittees are encouraged to go with the agency personnel when they are assessing ran-geland health and become familiar with the process. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) can also make rangeland health assessments on private land at the owner‘s re-quest.  Rangeland/riparian area trend  By far the most important monitoring element is rangeland and riparian area trend. Rangeland trend is defined as, ―The direction of change in an attribute as observed over time (SRM, 1998).‖ Trend is described as up, down or not apparent. This definition and concept applies equally well to riparian areas. Trend is used to monitor the long-term affects of management actions. A one-point-in-time rangeland health assessment does not provide adequate information to determine the direction of trend.  Soil, water and vegetation are the basic re-sources on rangelands; thus trend on both uplands and riparian areas is primarily assessed by mea-suring vegetation and soil attributes. The first priority is to protect the soil from erosion. Perennial vegetation (especially herbaceous species) pro-vides the best protection from erosion; the denser the ground cover of perennial vegetation, the less likely soil erosion will occur. We need to know whether our management actions are resulting in increasing or decreasing soil protection by the desired plant species. There are a variety of me-thods available to detect changes in vegetation. The challenge is in determining whether the changes were natural or due to management. Rangelands are dynamic; they are always res-ponding to climatic cycles, weather, fire, insects, grazing/browsing/soil disturbance by all animals living on the land and other physical disturbances; not just to livestock grazing.  Other rangeland goals include sustained fo-rage and browse production, fish and wildlife habi-tat, watershed enhancement, control of invasive species and other uses on public lands. Obtain-ment of these goals is also dependent on having an optimum ground cover of desirable perennial plant species.  For monitoring trend on uplands, both the BLM and the FS have used nested frequency and ground cover transects since the early 1980‘s along with permanent photo points. In 2005, both agencies in Idaho jointly developed a method for monitoring trend on riparian areas (Cowley and Burton, 2005). Detailed descriptions of monitoring methods used by the agencies can be found in ―Sampling Vegetation Attributes‖ (Interagency Technical Reference 1996) as well as agency range manuals. There is little to be gained from permittees using a different method than what the agencies use. Instead, the permittees would be better advised to cooperate with and assist the agencies with their monitoring activities; especially in providing their insight on interpretation of moni-toring data. Such cooperation will insure more thorough and frequent monitoring of allotments, provide data useable by both parties, result in bet-ter interpretation of data and facilitate the adaptive management process. Private land owners may wish to consult with the local NRCS or Cooperative Extension Service office for suggestions on moni-toring methods to use or contract with a profes-sional rangeland consultant to do the monitoring.  Number and location of trend study sites  The minimum number of trend study sites is one per pasture; more is better. Typically, the agencies may have only one site per pasture, lo-cated in the key area. Key area is defined as, ―A relative small portion of a range selected because of its location, use or grazing value as a monitoring point for grazing use. It is assumed that key areas, if properly selected, will reflect the overall accepta-bility of current grazing management over the range (SRM 1996).‖ While the concept sounds good in theory, identifying such a location is diffi-cult and subjective, especially on rangeland that has several major range types and may also have both low and high elevation sites in each pasture. In this case, one site will certainly not be indicative of what is happening on all parts of the pasture. 4 A Rancher‘s Guide to Monitoring Rangelands  However, if key areas are going to be used the permittees should be involved in selecting them because of their familiarity with the allotment and livestock use patterns. Reading trend transects can be time consuming. An alternative to more than one trend transect site per pasture is to locate additional permanent photo points in the pasture.  The agencies may also locate trend study sites in critical areas, defined as areas of special con-cern. Riparian areas, noxious weed infestations and habitat for threatened and endangered species are examples. Permittees should especially be involved in monitoring livestock use in riparian areas, as use and trend in these areas may dictate management on the entire allotment.  Even if permittees are not going to assist with monitoring studies on their allotment, they should at least know where the study sites are. Do not put your salt block on or near a study site!  Photographs  It has often been said that ―a picture is worth a thousand words,‖ and that holds true for monitoring rangelands, especially range trend. Permanent photographic plots and photo points taken periodi-cally provide a visual record of changes in vegeta-tion (or lack of change) over time; i.e. trend (Sharp and Sanders, 2005). Photographs provide excel-lent evidence for court cases. It requires little train-ing, time or expense to establish permanent photo points and take the pictures. On public lands, the range managers and the permittees should jointly select the location of the photo points and coordi-nate when the photos are taken and by whom.  At the very least, permanent photo points should be established at each trend study site, usually in the key area of a pasture and key ripa-rian area. However, the more photo points there are in a pasture, the better the trend information and management decisions. The limiting factor on number of photo points is the commitment to rou-tinely take the photos. The sites should be photo-graphed at least annually at a specific time, but before and after grazing in each pasture is prefer-able. Before and after grazing photos document range readiness as well as the degree of use in a pasture. If taken only once a year, it is generally recommend that photos be taken at the end of the grazing season. Documentation of other events, such as recreational and wildlife use and damage, vandalism and condition of range improvements are also recommended. It is especially important to document heavy use by wildlife before and after livestock grazing in a pasture or on a riparian area with photographs.  The FS and BLM generally mark the location of permanent photo points by driving a steel post into the ground then measuring a known distance and direction from the post to locate the photo plot/point. Both agencies use a 3 ft x 3 ft plot frame that is permanently marked with one or more short steel stakes and/or long spikes, painted with a bright red or orange color. In addition to taking a close-up photo of the plot, they take a general view photo by raising the camera straight up from the plot to include a small portion of the horizon. The plot stakes should be long enough to locate, but short enough that livestock cannot rub on them. Sharp-tipped stakes should be avoided as they can injure livestock and horses. It is best to lay out the site so that photos are taken facing the south in order to avoid shadows in the photos. A prominent landscape feature, such as a mountain top in the background, is not only useful in locating the photo point but also insures other viewers will accept photos taken over time as being in the same loca-tion. Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) re-ceivers are relatively cheap and are a useful way to mark and find trend study sites. If you have to purchase a camera, consider a combination cam-era/GPS unit. Hall (2001) provides considerable detail about photo monitoring.  A frequently asked question is, ―What kind of camera should I use?‖ If you do not already have a suitable camera, select one you are comfortable using and that can be carried in a saddlebag or pickup without damage. Digital cameras (minimum 3 megapixel, preferably 5) are now relatively inex-pensive, especially when the cost of processing regular film is considered. Digital cameras also allow you to make sure the photo is acceptable before leaving the site. Contrary to popular opinion, digital photos are also acceptable as evidence in legal proceedings.  Purchase a durable field notebook (pocket size) to record the photo point location, date and other information such as livestock/wildlife use in the area, high insect populations, or other signs of disturbance that will be useful in interpretation of trend. Identify each point with a number or name.  Even if you use a computer for storing digital photos, consider printing each photo to place in an album in chronological order by pasture and photo point. Interpretation of range trend data is best done out on the range with agency personnel and an album facilitates the field interpretation. It is also handy to have the album with you for reference in locating photo points and sighting the camera the next time you take the photos. Kenneth D. Sanders 5  Agencies are tending toward use of remote sensing (aerial photography) in lieu of or as a sup-plement to ground monitoring. If so, it is even more important that permittees become involved in moni-toring; remote sensing is of questionable value without ground level data to aid in interpretation of the aerial photos.  Apparent trend  Apparent trend is defined as, ―An interpreta-tion of trend based on observation and profession-al judgment at a single point in time (SRM, 1998).‖ Early in the range profession, a range trend score-card was developed based on indicators such as plant vigor, presence of seedlings, signs of soil erosion, etc. to determine apparent trend. The technique has not been recommended for many years due to its subjectivity. Unfortunately, the BLM and NRCS recently modified the old apparent trend scorecard and are using it for a rapid as-sessment of rangeland health, despite the objec-tions of most range scientists. Use of apparent trend and the rapid assessment technique for de-termining rangeland health are highly questionable and I do not recommend either as a basis for ran-geland management decisions.  Annual indicators  In addition to actual use, other annual monitor-ing information may be useful in interpreting long-term trend data and making adaptive management decisions. These include utilization mapping on uplands and stubble height, browse utilization and streambank trampling on riparian areas. Annual indicators should not be used as a part of the terms and conditions of a permit nor in lieu of long-term trend data to make grazing management decisions (University of Idaho Stubble Height Re-view Team 2004).  Mapping livestock utilization patterns can be a useful tool in grazing management. It can be used to establish key areas, identify distribution prob-lems and solutions and to make adjustments in annual operating plans. Periodically, near the end of the grazing season, a range inspection tour should be made to map distribution of grazing use in an allotment or pasture. The question that needs to be answered is what areas of a pasture received light, moderate and/or heavy use. It is especially important to map utilization patterns when there has been a change in the grazing system or range improvements, such as additional water develop-ments or a change in fence location. The use map should be prepared by the range managers and the permittees while riding together (the best way to see rangeland is from the back of a horse). Pe-riodic rides also provide an excellent opportunity for the range managers and the permittees to dis-cuss problems and solutions. There is little, if any, management utility in measuring degree of use precisely on a few transect locations. For a de-tailed discussion on the use of utilization see Sharp et al. (1994) and Smith et al. (2005).  Other records to keep  Range improvements:   Dates when water is available in springs, reservoirs, etc.   Potential sources of new water   Wildlife use of improvements   Salt location each year   Expenses, such as water hauling, main-tenance, construction and labor  Field observations   Poisonous, noxious and invasive plant lo-cations   Maintenance required, such as fence re-pairs to be done before the next season   Unusual insect, rodent and wildlife use/damage  Use by others   Off-road vehicle use and/or damage   Undeveloped campsites, especially on ri-parian areas   Hunting and fishing activity   Vandalism, including gates left open, fences cut   Trespassing livestock – include dates, number, ownership, entry point  Interpretation of monitoring data  As previously stated, interpretation of monitor-ing data is one of the most important elements of monitoring. It is at this point that we determine if trend is up, down or not apparent. Permittee partic-ipation in interpretation of the data is not only in the best interest of the permittees, but also the agen-cies. The permittees are on allotments much more frequently than agency personnel and may see things that are vital to the interpretation of trend. Most important, permittee participation improves communication, builds trust and greatly facilitates the adaptive management process. 6 A Rancher‘s Guide to Monitoring Rangelands  If the data shows upward trend, both parties will likely agree to continue with current grazing management. If trend is not apparent, it may indi-cate no change in the condition of the rangeland or that the monitoring system is not sufficiently sensi-tive to measure the change. If the conclusion is there has been no change in condition, the deci-sion must be made whether that is acceptable or not. Perhaps the management goals were unrealis-tic and not obtainable (expecting grazing manage-ment alone to convert cheatgrass infested rangel-and to perennial native vegetation is an excellent example). If it is not acceptable, then a minor ad-justment in management may be all that is neces-sary. The monitoring data may show that long-term management goals and objectives have been ob-tained. If this is the case, do new goals and objec-tives need to be established?  If the data shows downward trend, the real challenge in interpretation arises; why trend is downward. It should not be automatically assumed that downward trend is due to livestock grazing. Other factors that can cause downward trend in-clude: weather, especially a prolonged drought; fire; insects; rodents and other wildlife use; recrea-tional use; and invasive species. Sharp et al. (1990, 1992) and Sharp and Sanders (2005) pro-vide excellent examples of the effects weather and insects can have on rangeland vegetation and thus trend.  If it is determined that livestock grazing is the cause of downward trend, then a change in grazing management is probably warranted. Downward trend does not automatically justify a reduction in stocking rate! There are very few public land allotments that are overstocked. However, there are many public land allotments that have poor livestock distribution. Utilization mapping will show if distribution is the problem. If distribution is the problem, then there are several alternatives to obtain more uniform distribution, such as additional water developments, changes in fence and/or salt locations, or a change in the grazing system. A reduction in number of animals is not likely to solve the problem of overuse in one or more areas of the pasture, such as on riparian areas. Other man-agement alternatives to consider include develop-ing/using alternative forages, changing the time or system of grazing, or changing the class/kind of livestock. Permittees should be proactive in sug-gesting management changes to stop downward trend, if it is due to livestock grazing.  References  Cowley, E.R and T.A Burton. 2005.

H. Winward and E. W. Tisdale1  Taxonomic recognition of additional kinds of  woody sagebrush (Artemisia) in recent years has  re-emphasized that this is a difficult group to iden­tify.  People working with range lands, whether  as administrators, technical advisors or research­ers  have come to realize the importance of correct  identification in this group. This means recogni­tion  at species and often subspecies level, and here  lie the difficulties.  This report presents a simple and rapid method  to aid in making some of the more difficult sep­ar&  tions in the sagebrush complex. It was devel­oped  during a study of the ecology and taxonomy  of mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata  subsp. vaseyana).~ Both thin-layer chromatogra­phy  and morphological characters are being used  in this investigation. During the course of the re­search  we found that the general fluorescent color  of a sample of Artemisia foliage under ultra­violet  light could be helpful in separating certain  groups. Young (1965) used this method for initial  separation of Artemisia samples, followed by chro­matographic  tests for detailed information. The  fluorescent extract method has been tested further  by the authors, and is presented here as a field  aid for identification of difficult species and/ or  subspecies in Artemisia. Although this is designed  for use with fresh leaf material, it works equally  well with dried leaves from the field or from herb­arium  specimens. The method involves placing a  few grams of sagebrush leaves into a clear glass  bottle. Add enough methanol or ethanol to just  cover the leaves. Allow the alcohol to react ap­proximately  one-half hour (addition of 5 percent  HC1 to the alcohol or heat from direct sunlight  will reduce the reaction time by one-half) . In a  darkened area, hold a long wave ultra-violet lamp  (3660 angstroms) over the bottle and observe the  fluorescent color of the leaf extract directly  through the glass bottle. This may be done in the  field by using a battery power-pack or after re­turning  to an area where electricity is available.  Two general groups may be observed: (1) those  that fluoresce shades of bluish-cream and (2)  those that fluoresce shades of brownish-red.  Group 1.  Fluoresce shades of bluish-cream  A. tridentata subsp. vaseyana (mountain big  sagebrush)  A. rothrockii (rothrock sagebrush)  A. cana subsp. bolanderi (bolander silver  sagebrush)  A. arbuscula subsp. arbuscula (low sage­brush)  A. arbuscula subsp. thermopola (hotsprings  sagebrush)  A. longiloba (alkali sagebrush)  A. tripartita subsp. tripartita (three-tip sage­brush)  A. bigelovii (bigelow sagebrush)  'N .

Fluoresce shades of brownish-red  A. tridentata subsp. tridentata (basin big  sagebrush)  A. tridentata subsp. wyomingensis (wyoming  big sagebrush)  A. nova (black sagebrush)  A. tripartita subsp. rupicola (wyoming three­tip  sagebrush)  A. cana subsp. cana (silver sagebrush)  A. rigida (scabland sagebrush)  Greater difficulties are encountered in mor­phologically  separating taxa of these two groups  than taxa within either group. Examples of the  use of this fluorescent technique are provided be­low.  The nomenclature follows Beetle's (1960)  classification. Other studies by Young (1965),  Holbo and Mozingo (1965) and work at the Uni­versity  of Idaho substantiate to a large degree the  taxonomic separations outlined by Beetle.  Suppose one wishes to know whether the dwarf  sagebrush of an area is A. nova or A. arbuscula.  Within A. nova are two color variants. One has  dark green leaves and the other is a more pubes­cent  and therefore gray colored form. The green  form is distinct and more easily recognized while  the gray form more closely resembles A. arbus­cula  and is easily confused with it. These species  are easily separated by the fluorescent method.  When treated with alcohol both forms of A. nova  fluoresce a brownish-red color while both sub­species  of A. arbuscula fluoresce a bluish-cream  color.  This technique also is valuable in separating  subspecies within the big sagebrush group. A. tri­dentata  subsp. vaseyana fluoresces bluish-cream  while the subspecies tridentata and wyomingensis  fluoresce brownish-red. Fortunately it appears  that the newly recognized subspecies wyoming­ensis  can be distinguished from the subspecies  tridentata by morphological characters, for the  fluorescence test will not separate these two.  For plants lacking flower shoots, some diffi­culty  may be encountered in separating young  plants of big sagebrush from those of the dwarf  species. The fluorescence test will be valuable  here. Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis  and subsp. tridentata can be separated from A.  arbuscula and as skill is acquired with this meth­od,  it will be possible to separate subspecies vasey­ana  and A. arbuscula (though both are in the  bluish-cream group) by the shade of bluish-cream  fluorescence.  Other species such as A. tripartita, A. cana, A.  rigida, A. rothrockii and A. bigelovii are readily  identified by their morphological characteristics  and/ or geographic location. Although useable, the  fluorescence test is not usually necessary to sep­arate  these species.  After identifying the more difficult sagebrush  species and subspecies several times with the  fluorescence test, one should be able to separate  them by their subtle morphological characteristics  alone and the test will be necessary only as an  occasional check.  Research at this University suggests that accu­rate  separation of sagebrush species and sub­species  has more than taxonomic value. In addi­tion  to distinctive morphological and chemical  differences, each taxon has its own ecological re­quirements  and associated species. These are im­portant  considerations for management of the  vegetation types involved. Differences are also  being found in behavior and palatability among  some of these species. Future study should pro­vide  more information on these differences as well  as additional taxonomic data.  Literature Cited  Beetle, Alan A. 1960.

A Viewpoint  Kenneth D. Sanders, Professor  Rangeland Ecology & Management  University of Idaho  September 13, 2000 (Revised 10/12/00)  Some land management agencies have a  general policy that rangelands are to be rested  from grazing for at least two growing seasons  following fire. Many range scientists and range  managers, including myself, question this policy.  There are three reasons commonly cited for a  post-burn rest from grazing: recovery of residual  plants, regeneration of desirable plant species and  accumulation of litter for soil stability. The effect  of fire on plant survival and regeneration depends  on several variables, including plant species,  season of the fire, intensity of the fire, vigor of the  plants prior to the fire, associated species and  climatic conditions during and following the fire.  Soil stability varies by soil type, topography and  climatic conditions. Therefore, a more reasonable  approach would be to decide on a pasture by  pasture basis whether to graze the year following  the fire or to rest the pasture for two or more  growing seasons. This paper is not intended as an  exhaustive literature review, but rather, as a  starting point for on-the-ground discussions  between land managers and livestock permittees  in the coming year.  I will limit my discussion to the effect on  major perennial grass species of the sagebrush-grasslands  in the Intermountain Region. The late  Henry Wright, widely regarded as the preeminent  rangeland fire ecologist of the western U.S.,  discussed fire effects on this vegetation type  (Wright 1985). He reported that fire effect on  grasses is largely dependent on growth form and  season of burning. Bunchgrasses with densely  clustered culms and lots of leaf tissue (Idaho  fescue and needle-and-thread) are more  susceptible to damage by fire and are slower to  recover because the they will burn longer and  hotter than those without dense culms and less  leaf tissue (wheatgrasses). The latter burn quickly  with little heat transfer below the soil surface.  Rhizomatous grasses (thickspike and western  wheatgrasses) tolerate fire well, as does Indian  ricegrass. June and July is the most detrimental  season to burn bunchgrasses, with spring burns  less detrimental than fall burns.  In reviewing research on how long it takes for  bunchgrass production to return to preburn  levels, Wright (1985) reported that bluebunch  wheatgrass will recover in 1 to 3 years; Idaho  fescue 2 or more years; and needlegrasses 3 or  more years, all depending on soil moisture,  season and intensity of the fire. But what is the  effect of grazing on perennial grasses the first  season after they burn? Jirik and Bunting (1994)  examined the response of bluebunch wheatgrass  and bottlebrush squireltail grass to post-fire  defoliation at two locations in southern Idaho.  They found that late season defoliation (after  seedset) the first year after burning did not  significantly reduce the vigor of either grass  species. Production, basal area and tiller numbers  of bluebunch wheatgrass were not affected by  late season defoliation, despite two years of  below normal precipitation following the fire.  Squireltail grass was slightly more sensitive to late  2  season defoliation than bluebunch wheatgrass.  Early season defoliation (during the boot  phenological stage) the first year after burning did  reduce vigor of the two grasses. Bunting et al.  (1998) found that early-season defoliation the  first year after fire resulted in plant mortality as  high as 50% for Idaho fescue and 70% for  bluebunch wheatgrass in a study in northern  Idaho. However, the effects were lessened when  defoliation was delayed one growing season after  the fire.  Uresk et al. (1980) reported an increase in  vegetative growth and superior reproductive  performance in bluebunch wheatgrass during the  first post-burn season. Patton et al. (1988) also  found greater seed production of bluebunch  wheatgrass on 2 out of 4 one-year old burns,  compared to unburned control plots. Idaho  fescue had less seed production on the burned  areas than the unburned controls on one-year old  burns, but recovered by the third year. Bunting  (1985) pointed out that most studies indicate  two to several years may be required for this to  occur. He attributes the increase in production  primarily to an increase in production per plant  and not an increase in density of plants (new  plants established from seed). Thus it appears  that the increased seed production does not  necessarily result in new plants becoming  established. What causes a low establishment  rate has not been addressed by research, except  when there is competition from invading annual  grasses, such as cheatgrass.  In order for perennial grasses to establish  from seed, certain requirements have to be met.  These are a source of viable seed, adequate seed  coverage, suitable germination temperatures,  minimal competition from other plants and last,  but probably most important, adequate soil  moisture for the seedling to develop sufficiently  that it can survive the dry summers. Patton et al.  (1988) reported the number of filled florets (i.e.  viable seed) was greater on burned plots than on  unburned control plots on bluebunch wheatgrass,  Idaho fescue and Columbia needlegrass. Thus it  is likely there is an adequate source of viable  seed the first year following a burn. Suitable  temperatures for seed germination will occur  every spring, although the date may vary from  year to year  Soil moisture is not only required for a plant to  germinate, but there must be sufficient moisture in  the seedling root zone over a long enough period  for the plant to develop sufficiently to survive an  extended dormant period. For most  bunchgrasses, this requires the seedling to reach  the 3-leaf or greater stage of growth. At higher  elevations (6000 ft plus), there is generally  adequate soil moisture for seedling establishment.  At lower elevations in the Intermountain Region,  adequate soil moisture is dependent on the  frequency of spring precipitation. Some years it is  adequate, some it is not. It is common at the  lower elevations to see seedlings of plants every  year of both grasses and sagebrush. However, in  years with below average spring precipitation,  most of those seedlings do not survive.  Competition from other plants, especially  annual grasses, is generally not a problem on  higher elevation rangelands. However, where  cheatgrass or medusahead was present prior to  the fire or a seed source is at hand, competition  for moisture on the lower elevation rangelands  can be a problem for perennial grass seedling  establishment. Considerable research has been  conducted on reducing or controlling the  competition from these annual grasses, but such  control is not assured with mechanical or  chemical means. The most successful biological  control method has been to seed crested  wheatgrass. Crested wheatgrass and squireltail  grass are the only perennial grass species that  have been shown to successfully compete with  the annual grasses in the Intermountain Region.  3  Since cheatgrass generally initiates growth earlier  in the spring than crested wheatgrass (or other  perennial bunchgrasses), competition from the  cheatgrass might be reduced with livestock  grazing in the spring, before the perennial  seedlings have made sufficient growth to be  grazed.  The final criteria for successful seed  germination and establishment is adequate seed  coverage. All perennial grasses require some  seed coverage by mineral soil before the seed  can germinate. However, cheatgrass can  germinate and become established lying on top of  the soil, again giving it a competitive advantage. It  is widely accepted by those with experience in  seeding rangelands that aerial broadcasting of  seed on burned areas at lower elevations is  seldom successful and it is only slightly more  successful at the higher elevations. The greater  success at higher elevations is probably related to  a deeper ash layer to cover the seed and more  available moisture. Why is aerial broadcasting  seldom successful at lower elevations? The most  likely cause is inadequate seed coverage,  especially when the area is placed off limits to  livestock grazing for two or more growing  seasons. The principles of rest-rotation grazing,  developed by Gus Hormay (1961) and widely  applied throughout the Intermountain Region and  the Pacific Northwest, especially the treatment of  grazing after seed ripe to get seed coverage  applies to burned areas as well as low condition  rangelands.  The argument can be made that in some  cases it might be better to graze the first year  following fire. When there is an adequate stand of  perennial bunchgrasses surviving a fire, grazing  after seed ripe may enhance the establishment of  new plants through seed coverage. However, if  the perennial plants were in low vigor prior to the  fire, then the area should probably be rested for  the entire first year. Those species more  susceptible to fire (i.e. Idaho fescue, needle-and-thread)  should also be rested the first year.  Following the principles of rest-rotation grazing, if  there are abundant seedlings the second spring  and average or above spring precipitation, the  area should probably be rested that entire grazing  season to give the seedlings a chance to become  established. Second, on lower elevation  rangelands faced with heavy competition from  annual grasses, consideration should be given to  grazing the burned area early the first spring or  two to reduce competition from the annuals with  perennial grass seedlings.  A blanket policy of withholding livestock  grazing on a burned area for two or more  growing seasons is open to question. The  decision to graze or not to graze the first year  following the fire may vary from one pasture to  another within an allotment, depending on the  many variables affecting plant survival, growth  and reproduction. Because of the many variables  involved, such decisions should be made on a  case by case basis.  Literature Cited  Bunting, S.C. 1985.

This report focuses on the 11 western states  because 92% of all livestock grazing administered by the  and USFS occurs within these states (USDA·FS 1989,  BLM 1986). The BLM and USFS regulate livestock  on 161.8 million acres (USDA·BLM 1989) and 44.6  acres (SRM 1989), respectively, in the West.  Introduction  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.Service (USFS) collectivel y manage 315.8 million acres  within the 11 western states: Arizona, California, Colorado,  Idaho, Montana, Nevada , New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,  Wa shington, and Wyoming (US DI-BLM 1989, USDA-1989). By law, these land s are managed to provide  sustained production of multiple, renewable natural  resources (FLPMA 1976, NFMUA 1982) . These re sources  include water, lumber, recreation, wildlife habitat, li vestock forage. This report co n cerns current i ss ues surrounding the harvest of livestoc k forage on western public lands.  In recent years, livestock grazing o n public lands become embroiled in a flaming controversy fueled misinformation . The purpose of thi s report i s to pr~fact ual, well-documented information to those people­spo  rtsmen, conservationists, students, teachers, legislators,  and others-genuinely conc erned about publi c land  livestock grazing . Our goal is to aid and promote decision­making  based on factual information, rather than uninformed perceptions or special-interest propaganda.  Specifically, we seek to dispe l seven popular myths lives toc k grazing on public land s.  Livestock grazing on public lands plays an  Insignificant role In US. cattle and sheep  production.  1988, the 11 western states supported 20% (7.5  the nation's total beef cows and replacement  raised 19% (7.5 million)"" of the nation's calves  1989). Because SO% of the beef cows in the 11  states graze at least part of the year on public  1984), public land livestock grazing supported  million) of the nation's beef cattle breeding herd.  production in several western states depends  upon public land forage . For example, 88% of the  Idaho, 81% in Nevada, 64% in Wyoming, and  Arizona graze at least part of the year on public  1984). ·  sheep and wool production is even more  than cattle production upon public land forage.  11 western states supported 51% (3.6 million)  nation's total stock ewes and raised 48% (3.5 million)  nation's lamb crop (USDA 1989). In 1987 (the most  from which data are available) , the 11 western  produced 52% (44.6 million pounds) of the  shorn wool. Although the exact percentage of  sheep that graze public lands is not known,  the sheep within the 17 western states, which  Texas and the Great Plains, harvest public land  and Madsen 1983). Because little public land  Texas and the Great Plains, sheep dependency in  western states likely exceeds 40%. Calculations  conservative 40 % dependency figure reveal  grazing supports 20% (1.8 million) of U.S. stock  produces 21% (17.8 million pound s) of U.S.  This is not an insignificant contribution.  public land grazing, nearly all of the 1.4  stock ewes and 3.7 million beef cows and replace­ment  that utilize public lands-or 47% of all the  and stock ewes that graze in the 11 Western  would be eliminated . This is because livestock graz­ing  public lands is usually wholly integrated with live­stock  grazing on private lands. Summer ranges in much of  commonly located on public land in moun-  2  tainous terrain that is covered with snow during the and can be grazed only in summer. Winter range? are lower elevations, often on private lands, whe~e wmter  storms are less severe. In the Southwest, grazmg may year-round on public lands,. wi~~ the se~so~al movements  of livestock dictated by ~vallabll1ty of dnnkmg water. water sources are often located on private lands. In more northern latitudes, livestock must be fed hay during  winter, hay that is grown on the lower elevati?n pr~lands during summer when livestock are grazmg h~elevation public lands. Conseque~tly, the us~ of ~nvate public grazing lands in the W~st IS ofte~ ent1rely mt~r­dependent.  While only a port1on of a l1vestock herds year­ly  forage needs may be supplied by public lands, the.  public lands serve as ""critical habitat"" because there available substitute (CAST 1986).  The significance of public Jan~ forage to U.S. cattle sheep production is often misinterpreted when people learn that only 1% of the sheep and cattle (beef and feed consumed in the U.S. is supplied by public lands  (calculated from USDA 1989, USDA-FS 1989, USDI-1989) . But this percentage is based upon the total of feed consumed by all cattle and sheep, including consumed in feedlots where older, larger animals are heavy rations to reach slaughter weight. Public lands  supply a small percentage of the tot~l feed co.nsumed par­tially  because their primary product IS small livestock­lambs  and beef calves-that do not eat as much as larger animals.  The true significance of public land for~ge is t~provides an integral feed source for producmg the m­puts  (i.e., calves and lambs) into the beef and sheep  production cycles. After weaning, lam~s and calves public land-dependent ranches are sh1p~ elsewhere further grazing or feeding to slaughter we1ghts (largely Texas Oklahoma Nebraska, and eastern Colorado), they ~onsume la;ge quantities of feed. The livelihoods many Great Plains and Midwest ranchers, feedlot and meat packers depend upon the continued supply calves and lambs raised on ranches dependent upon land forage.  3  Livestock grazing on public lands  Insignificant contribution to the US.  and the western livestock Industry.  f cattle and calves grazing in the 11 western  valued in 1988 at $7.7 billion, or 20% of the  total value of beef cattle not in feedlots (USDA  Because 50% of the beef cattle that graze in the  public land forage (Gee 1984), public land­dependent  cattle are worth $3.8 billion. In 1988, stock  lambs in the 11 western states were valued at  million, or 49 % of the nation's total value of stock  USDA 1989) . Because at least 40% of western sheep  public land forage (Gee and Madsen 1983), public  dependent sheep are worth $159.2 million.  addition to the $4.0 billion invested in sheep and  graze public lands, an annual value of produc­tion  derived from these animals. The 1986 annual  production from all grazing beef cattle and stock  the 11 western states was $3 .3 biHion, or 21% of  total annual value of production from grazing  and stock sheep (USDA 1987). In 1986, cattle  relying on public lands produced an annual  over $1.6 bi Ilion . For several western states, th e  public land livestock production is an important  of the state economy. For example, beef cattle  dependent upon public land forage comprises  Montana's and 1.9% of Idaho's gross state product  1987, USDC-BEA 1988). Similarly, Wyoming and  derive 1.2% and 0 .4 %, respectively, of their gross  product from cattle that use public lands (USDA 1987,  1988). These ""s mall"" percentages of gross state  however, do not indicate an insignificant  contribution. For comparison, Kansas derives 1.7% of its  product from wheat production, corn production  1.0 % of Illinois' gross state product, and Florida  % of its gross state product from oranges (USDA  USDC-BEA 1988). These figures reveal that cattle  public lands plays a vital role in the economies  western states. Public land-dependent cattle are  important to both Idaho and Montana th an wheat is  more important to Wyoming than corn is to  4  Illinois; and equally important to Nevad a as oranges Florida. It should be noted that the above economic relate on l y to ca ttle and do not incl ude the additional con­tributions  from public land-dependent sheep and production.  5  l.Dw fedeml grazing fees encoumge  numbers of livestock on public lands.  as the federal government collects fees for  public land campgrounds, the BLM and USFS  grazing fees from ranchers whose cattle and sheep  public land forage. The number of animals that  allowed to graze is determined by the BLM  Professionally trained BLM and USFS personnel  when and where grazing can occur (USDA-FS  BLM 1986) . The number of livestock permitted is  the land's capacity to support grazing livestock,  determined by ecological characteristics such as soil  precipitation received, and with consideration of  natural resource uses and values. Because grazing  affect a unit of land's ecology, grazing fees  affect the land's grazing capacity, nor the number of  permitted to graze. The grazing fee is a political  economic decision made by Congress, whereas grazing  an ecological decision made by the BLM and  Current grazing fees can affect actual numbers of  grazed on public lands only if grazing fees become  to permittee ranchers, thus forcing them out of  6  . ------ .  ---------~ 7  Federal grazing permittees receive an  unprecedented subsidy because BLM and USFS  administration of livestock grazing permits costs  government more than Is generated  fees.  and USFS administration of grazing permits  federal government more than is currently  directly by grazing fees. But the difference is less  commonly perceived. A BL~ study determined that  the total costs of the BLM's rangeland program  livestock grazing (USDA-FS and USDI-BLM 1986).  remainder of the budget covers legislatively mandated  for basic rangeland conservation. These duties  providing baseline vegetation inventory data and  the ecological condition of public lands. In  cost of these non-livestock activities was $17.6  USDA-FS and USDI-BLM 1986). Additionally,  livestock grazing, the federal government would be  absorb the permittees' costs for maintaining and  water developments that benefit wildlife and wild  burros. These annual permittee costs were  total $5.7 million in 1983 (USDA-FS and USDI­BLM  When both the non-livestock grazing costs and  development maintenance costs are accounted  58% of the BLM's range management program  to administering the livestock grazing program .  1983 the BLM would have spent $23.3 million for  of public grazing lands and $32 million  administering the grazing program. In turn, the BLM  16.7 million in grazing fees, resulting in a $15.3  expenditure for its livestock grazing program. A  of $2.44/AUM' would have precluded the need  federal subsidy (USDA-FS and USDJ-BLM 1986).  the USFS spent $32.8 million on its range  program. If the USFS and BLM spend a  percentage of their range management funds on  grazing (i.e., 58%), then in 1988 the USFS spent  administering its livestock grazing program  Animal Unit Month) is the amount of feed or forage  one mature cow or the equivalent for one month.  8  while receiving $8.7 million in grazing fee receipts (USDA­FS  1989). This · difference resulted in a $10.3 million  expenditure by the USFS to administer its livestock grazing  program.  Livestock grazing is not the only public land activity  that costs more to administer than is generated by user  fees. For exa mple, in 1988 the USFS operated its wildlife  and fish habitat management program at a net loss of $47.4  million and its recreation program at a net loss of $89.4  million (USDA-FS 1989). These deficits constitute an  astounding ~ubsidy of $136.8 million to ·campers, hikers,  photographers, birdwatchers, hunters, fishermen, white  water rafters, and others (Fig. 1).  150  e  .!!! 100  0  0  c:  .2  i  123.7  Recreation Wildlife  & Fish&gt; ,  •costs  I!n Receipts  Livestock  Grazing  Figure 1. Estimated costs and receipts from the U.S. Forest  Service administration of recreation, wildlife and fish, and  livestock grazing in 1988.  9  Myth 5: Public land grazing fees are low  relative to private land lease rates, thus  providing federal grazing permittees a subsidy  an unfair economic advantage over non­permittee  ranchers.  fact: Ranchers leasing private lands usually pay more per  than the amount paid by public land permittees. For  example, in 1982 the public land grazing fee was  AUM, whereas the average private lease rate for  nonirrigated grazing land in the West was $7.43/AUM  Brokken and McCarr, 1987). However, this disparity does  sult in an unfair economic advantage for permittee  ranchers. A recent study by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture's Economic Research Service found that for  western cow/calf enterprises there was no significa nt  difference in net receipts between permittees and  nonpermittees (USD~FS and USDI-BLM 1986).  There are two main re asons why the difference  between private and public grazing fee s does not provide  economic advant~ge for federal permittees. One reason  fed era l permittees incur greater operating expenses  items such as traQsportation and herd management. For  example, in Idaho in 1982, total non-fee costs averaged  14.59/AUM on public lands compared to $7.54/AUM on  private lands (Oberrniller and Lambert 1984).  The second reason why public land grazing fees do not  provide federal permittees an economic advantage is that  permittees in~urred extra costs when they acquired  ranch properties. That is, when permittee ranchers  bought their ran ch properties, they pa id for the land's  increased value (eith~r through capital outlay or increased  inheritance tax) that was gained from having a public land  grazing permit assigned. The value of the grazing permit  capitalized into the value of the private ranch property  paid by the permittee in the form of interest (or in  opportunity cost associated with the use of equity capital if  money was borrowed to purchase the ranch property).  financial reality exists for almost all federal permittees  because from the time public land grazing permits were  assigned to individual ranches, largely from 1905-1940,  10  almost all ranch properties have transferred to new owners  (Nielsen and Workman 1971).  While the BLM and USFS do not formally recognize  permit va lue as an entitlement to permittees, the increased  value of a ranch due to its grazing permit is recognized other branches of the federal government. For example, Internal Revenue Service taxes the value of the grazing  permit, and banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation accept the value of grazing permits as collater­al  for loans (Rimbey 1989) .  It also Is important to remember that from the  inception of U.S. land policy, the federal government did  not administer its lands as an ordinary . proprietor seeking sell products (e.g., timber and forage) at the highest  possible price. Rather, these products were initially offered  either free or at very low prices to encourage citizens to  settle and develop the West. Just as Ja~d was given to rail­road  compan ies in return for establishi -ng tran sportation  routes, grazing permits were given to ranches in return for  citizens risking their lives and capital to establish a tax  base for schools and local government~ (Dana and Fairfa 1980). Continued existence of ranching operations that  harvest public land forage remains official U.S. policy  (FLPMA 1976, NFMUA 1982).  11  Myth 6: Livestock gmzfng on public lands Is  causing the ecological condition of these lands  deteriomte.  fact: Public lands were severely abused in the late  1800's and early 1900's due to improper livestock grazing.  some locations, soil and vegetation are still recovering  from these past abuses. Also, improved livestock grazing  management is needed even today in many areas. But  generally, public lands are currently in the best condition  they have been in this century, and the improvement is  continuing.  Eighty-eight percent of USFS lands and 79% of BLM  lands are either improving or stable in ecological condition  trend is undetermined on an additional 6 % of BLM  lands) (SRM 1989). Si-milarly, 76% of the 44.6 million acres  USFS land suitable for livestock grazing have a satisfacto­ry  livestock forage resource value rating (SRM 1989). A  satisfactory rating means that current management practices  adequately protect the soil and are acceptably maintaining  improving plant species composition and production.  Descriptions of the percentages of land within various  ecological condition classes are difficult to understand and  interpret. Traditionally, the BLM and USFS have described  ecological status in t~rms of four or five range condition  classes : ""excellent;' ""good;' ""fair;' "" poor;' or ""very poor:'  These classifications reflect comparisons between a site's  existing vegetation (i.e., which plant species are present  their relative amounts) and what the site could  potentially support if natural plant succession progressed  unimpeded through time. An ""excellent"" rating meant the  existing vegetation closely resembled its natural potential ,  whereas a "" poor "" rating meant the existing vegetation was  dissimilar to its ·natural potential. Traditional range  condition ratings are not , by definition, formulated to  describe whether current management is successful, but  merely to characterize a site's vegetation relative to its  natural potential.  Unfortunately, some persons have concluded that ''fair""  poor"" ratings are synonymous with unsatisfactory,  implying that current management practices need to be  12  changed. This may or may not be true, depending upon  which plant species and relative amounts are desired on site. Often multiple uses (e.g., wildlife habitat, camping,  hiking, livestock grazing) are best provided when a site's  veg etation is very different from its natural potential compo­sition.  For example, deer forage is usually maximized on site when shrubs and forbs are abundant, rather than  perennial grasses. But if such a site's natural potential were  abundant perennial grasses, its existing vegetation would judged very dissimilar from its potential. Accordingly, this  site would be reported in a "" lower"" condition class (e.g.,  ""fair"" or "" poor:"") , even though the site may currently  support the desired plant species in the desired relative  amounts.  The misinterpretation of range condition ratings has  prompted th e BLM and the USFS to change their methods  of reporting ecological condition. While not perfectly  synonymous, the traditional terms ""excellent;' ""good;' ""fair;'  and ""poor"" are being replaced by the more appropriate  terms "" potential natural community (PNC) ;' ""late-seral;'  ""mid-seral;' and "" early-sera!! ' These new term s better  describe a site's existing vegetation rela!ive to its natural  potential and do not inject subjective bias as do qualitative  terms such as good or poor.  The USFS has adopted the new terms, while the BLM  has begun the conversion but currently · still reports the  traditional ratings . In 1987, the ecological status of USFS  lands suitable for livestock grazing was rated as 15% PNC,  32% late-seral, 38% mid-seral, and 15 % early-seral (SRM  1989). In 1988, ecological status of BLM lands was rated 4 % excellent, 30 % good, 38% fair, 17 % poor, and 11 %  unclassified (USDI-BLM 1989).  13  Myth 7: Livestock grazing on public lands Is  causing a decline in big game populations on  these lands.  fact: livestock grazing occurs on about 93 % of BLM  in the West (USDI-BLM 1989), and big game popula-tions  on these lands are steadily increasing. In the 11-year ,.  from 1977-1988, the total big game population (in-cludes  barbary sheep, bear, bighorn sheep, bison, caribou,  elk, javelina, moose, mountain goat, and pronghorn  antelope) grew from about 1.5 million to 1.9 million, a 31%  increase {USDI-BLM 1978, 1989). Pronghorn antelope  increased from about 199,000 in 1977 to 296,000 in 1988,  49% increase. Deer. (includes black-tailed, mule deer, and  tailed) increased from about 1.2 million to 1.4  million, a 25% increase. Elk increased 38 %, from about  104,000 to 143,000.  Big game populations on USFS lands in the West also  increasing, while 32% of USFS lands in the West are  classified suitable for livestock grazing (SRM 1989). From  to 1984 (the mo.st recent year from which data are  available) the big game population grew from about 2.5  million to 2.6 million· (USDA-FS 1977, 1984). Pronghorn  antelope numbers grew from about 49,000 to 58,000, a  increase over 1977 I eve Is. Deer increased 1 % to 1.9  million, and elk numbers grew 8%, from about 429,000 to  464,000.  14 15  Summary  Western public lands are managed to provide the U.S.  sustained production of multiple, renewable natural  resources. Products include water, recreation, lumber, .  firewood, open space, and forage for wild. an? domestic  animals. The continued harvest of domestiC livestock forage  become embroiled in controversy, a controversy fue~ed  misinformation and myth. Future discussions of public  livestock grazing policies should bE: founded up?n  facts, including these seven facts about livestock grazmg on  public lands:  Livestock grazing on public lands plays a significant  role in u.s. cattle and sheep production.  livestock grazing ~n public lands makes a significant  contribution to the U.S. economy and the western  livestock industry.  Low public land grazing fees do not influenc~ the  number of livestock allowed to graze on public lands.  The public land li~stock grazing program costs th~  federal government more than is generated by graZI~g  fees but even larger ""subsidies"" exist for other public  land management .programs, including wildlife and  recreation.  Federal grazing permittees do not have an economic  advantage over non-permittee ranchers.  Ecological conditions of public lands are improving in  the presence of regulated livestock grazing.  Big game populations on public lands are increasing  in the presence of regulated livestock grazing.  16  Literature Cited  Brokken, R.F., and B.A. McCarl. 1987.

Sharp, Professor  Range Management  University of Idaho  Forest, Wildlife and Range Experiment Station  University of Idaho  Ernest Wohletz, Director  E. W. Tisdale, Associate Director  BULLETIN NO.4  Issued under partial support of the Bureau of Land rvlanagement  Introduction  Fifteen years of grazing trials at the Point Springs experimental  area in southern Idaho provides the basis for the suggested management  of crested wheatgrass rangebnd presented in this paper.  Successful management of crested wheatgrass range, as well as  other types of forage areas, requires an artful application of scientific  principles. General guides such as· 50 or 6,S. percent utilization levels or  rigid patterns of rotation among pastures are inadequate for the inten­sive  management that will he needed as rangeland area decreases and  other land uses impose restrictions on the amount of forage harvested  by grazing animals.  Essential to the formulation of a management program for the  effective use of rangeland is a knowledge of: (1) the goals and objec­tives  to be achieved, (2) general plant growth characteristics, (.3)  limitations imposed on forage production by habitat conditions, (4) the  relationship of forage production to alternative grazing practices and  (5) the requirements of grazing animals and the livestock operation.  Other information is often required such as the use of the rangeland  area for purposes other than grazing, but such considerations are outside  the scope of this paper.  Goals and Objectives for Management  It is assumed, for the purpose of the material to be presented, that  optimum sustained livestock production is the primary goal in man­aging  crested wheatgrass. This goal can hest be achieved by maintaining  the stand of grass in a producbve state and protecting the soil resource  from deterioration. Pursuing this goal generally does not detract from  other resource values such as maintaining favorable wildlife habitat,  watershed values and scenic attractiveness.  Description of the Experimental Area  The Point Springs Experimental area , located in the Haft River  Valley of Cassia County, Idaho at an elevation of approximately 4800  feet, has similar physiographic features as large parts of Nevada, Utah  and eastern Oregon. Broad va1leys bordered by parallel mountain  ranges characterize these arE'as. Annual precipitation averages about  twelve inches at the experimental site, but has varied from 6 to 18  inches during the twelve years from 19.57-1868. Table l. About 35 to 40  percent of the annual precipitation falls during the months of April,  ~~lay and Tune , the period most important for plant growth. The gray  desert soils of the area have limited development. The depth to a  restrictive layer varies from six inches to 19 or 20 inches ancl averages  about 12-13 inches. Irregularly shaped areas with soils high in salt  concentrations (So1idizecl-So1onetz) occur.

In the viewpoint of the writer,  crested wheatgrass is adapted to the Point Springs area largely as a  result of the high proportion of tl-,e annual precipitation that falls during  the growing season.  The vegetation on the study area probably consisted of an Artemisia  tridentata-Ag1'0p yron spicatum association. Big sagebrush (Artemisia  tTidentata ) and blue bunch wheatgrass (Agropyron Spicatum) dominated  but Sandberg's bluegrass ( Poa secuTda) occurred frequently. Grease­wood  ( Sarcobatus vermiculatus ) and rabbitbrush ( Chrysothamntts vis­cidiflorus  ) appeared less frequently. A few annual forbs comprised the  spring flora and perennial forb ssuch as death camas ( Z.igadenus pani­culatus)  and loco weed (Astragalus beckwithii ) occurred scattered in the  area.  Interspersed in the sagebrush-bluebunch wheatgrass association on  the salty soils mentioned previously were small islands containing salt­sage  communities. The principal species, saltsage ( Atriplex nttttrallii),  may have been associated with Indian ricegrass ( Oryzopsis hymenoides )  and squirreltail grass (Sitanion hystrix).  Heavy livestock grazing in the days· of settlement and prior to  regulated use of the public domain drastically altered the original vege­tation.  Herbaceous species declined and the woody species, especially  big sagebrush, increased in amount. Livestock grazing capacity was  rated at 27 acres per animal unit month by the Bureau of Land Manage­ment  in the early 1950's compared to an estimated 3-5 acres when live­stock  were introduced.  Immediately prior to seeding, the study area had a thick cover of  big sagebrush and some rabbitbrush. Herbaceous species occurred infre­quently  and these consisted primarily of Sandberg's bluegrass, halogeton  (Halogeton glomeratus), Russian thistle (Salsola Kali), tansy mustard  (Descurainia richardsonii) and peppergrass (Lepidittm perfoliatum). The  shrubs and other plants were removed with a wheatland disc plow on  approximately 7,000 acres in the summer of 1952. Planting of crested  wheatgrass and yellow sweetclover ( M elilotus officinal is) took place in  the fall of the same year at the rate of 5.5 pounds and l.l pounds per  acre, respectively. A flexible harrow drag covered the seed broadcasted  with an E-Z flow fertilizer spreader.  A number of annual plants grew in the extremely favorable spring  of 1953. Tansy mustard, peppergrass, and Russian thistle attained con­siderable  size during this period and obscured the crested wheatgrass  . plants. The extremely dry growing season of 1954 caused poor growth  of the annual plants. The material produced by Russian thistle in 1953,  however, remained on the ground as dry material in 1954 and provided  protection from drying winds for the young crested wheatgrass plants.  The stand of crested wheatgrass was well established by the fall of that  year despite the drought in 1954. Experimental grazing trials com­menced  in the spring of 1955 and have continued through 1969.  3  The experimental trials consisted of grazing yearling cattle at three  intensities, 50, 65, and 80 percent (light , moderate, and heavy) utiliza­tion  .of th e forage supply in each of two seasons, spring and fall. Spring  grazmg commenced about M ay 1 and fall grazing started in early  Se ptemb e r. The grazing period varied between 45 a nd 56 days in each  season. The animals grazed 160-ac re fenced areas between 1955 and  1960. Division of the 160-acre pastures in 1960 provided for the addition  of spring-fall grazing combinations on 80-acre p as ture areas, Figure l.  Abandonment of the light and moderate fall grazing treatments after  the 1965 trials provided area for an alternating early and late spring  grazing treatment.  General Growth Characteristics of Crested Wheatgrass  In the Raft River Valley, g rowth of crested wheatgrass generally  starts in mid-March to early April. New growth on the first of April  averages about 70-85 pounds p e r acre. Crested wheatgrass stands at  lower elevations and on areas with warmer te mperatures could be  expected to have two or three times this amount of production on the  first of April.  Creste d wheatgrass herbage accumulates generally at a rate be­tween  four and seven pounds per acre per day during April and aver­ages  between 200 and 300 pounds per acre the first of May. With ade­quate  moisture and warm temper a tures, growth rate may exceed this  value and a production as high as 400 pounds of new growth on May 1  has been recorded at Point Springs. With the advent of warmer tem­peratures  in May, the growth rate increases and may b e as high as 20  or 25 pounds but averages about 10-15 pounds per acre pe r day.  With growth generally complete by mid-July , th e grass rapidly  loses or has lost green color. Growth te rminates earlier in a dry year,  or, with summer precipitation, continues on into the fall. New green  growth develops in the fall of some years when moisture and tempera­ture  conditions are suitable. The 150 to 200 pounds of fall growth on  crested wheatgrass in 1968, fo llowing a moist August, contrasts sharply  with the less than 50 to 100 pounds produced in some other years of  the study.  The stem apex of crested wheatgrass, near the surface of th e ground  until early May, elongates rapidly until late May or ea rly June. Heads  emerge from the boot in late May or early June and flow ering occurs  from mid-to late June. With the stem apex intact the stem will co ntinue  to grow. Once the stem apex has been removed , that stem ceases to grow  and all regrowth must co me from buds at th e base of th e grazed stem.  The new stem may or may not produce a seed head. The n e w growth,  often more leafy than the original stem first grazed, has significance in  the nutritive value of the forage for fall grazing.  Impact of Climatic Conditions on Growth Characteristics  Climatic conditions during any one year have a decided influence  on the growth characteristics of crested wheatgrass. The amount and  distribution of April , May and June precipitation largely determines the  a nnual forage production at Point Springs. Air and soil t e mperatures  also influence plant growth during this period of suitable soil moisture.  4  S pr in 11 L i 11 h t L i 11 h t S p r in 11 Heavy Spdng'  &. Fa II Spring & Spr in 11 &.

Between 70 and 80 percent of this variability in production  can be attributed to the amount of precipitation that falls on the area  in April, ~1l ay and June. \Vith accumulated winte r moisture generally  sufficient during April for plant growth, tempe ratures largely influence  growth ra te in this month. The increase in air dry prod uction during  April varies from about four to seven pounds per day, T able 2. The  generally warme r temperatures in May provide the stimulus fo r rapid  growth if moisture conditions are suitable. The growth rate in 1967  varied between 19 and 25 pounds per day after mid-May. Less than  two pounds per day of growth occurred durin ~ this period in 1969,  Table 2. Lack of moisture ra ther than unsuitable temperatures limited  growth rate in late May of 1969.  Table 2.

Soil areas with high concentrations of  exchangeable sodium occur within the less salty areas of soil and range  in size from less than one acre to about 15 acres. During years with  less than average growing season precipi ta tion, these saline areas have  a more stunted herbage growth than the less saline areas. The number  and size of the cres ted wheatgrass plants on the salty areas often decline  during or following the dry years. Little or no difference has been  observed between the two kinds of soil areas in years with above aver­age  growing season precipitation, Figure 3.  Impact of Grazing on Plant Growth  Crazing practices have an influence on stand density, herbage  production and nutritive value of the forage produced. The nature and  extent of the grazing influence on plant growth vary with weather  conditions, soil type, intensity and time of grazing and othe r factors.  6  900  800  ... 700  ~  "" &lt;! 600  .~,  Q. 500  ."",'  c: 400  0"" a.. 300  200  100  Figure 2.

As close cropping continues the stand becomes less dense and  less uniform in distribution, Table 4.  Table 4. Frequency of occurrence of crested wheatgrass plants in one  square-foot sample plots under three intensities of spring  grazing at Point Springs, 1955-1969.

Plant numbers and frequency declined under all intensi­ties  of use during and following the 1960 and 1961 drought. Declines  were greater, however, under heavy grazing than light or moderate  grazing.  During years of favorable precipitation plant numbers increase and  dead plant centers often disappear during these periods.  Impact of Grazing on Nutritive Value. Tlw limited chemical  analyses of forage material from the Point Springs experimental are,l  indicate that moderate or heavy grazing in only one season improves  the quality of forage available to livestock the following year compared  9  to light grazing iu o1dy one season. This results because of the lower  amount of residue carried over to the following year at the heavier  intensities of grazing. In HJ67, at the conclusion of the spring grazing  trials, tbe crude protein content of the herbage remaining was 11.4  percent in the light use pasture, 11.9 percent in the moderate use pasture  and 16.7 percent in the heavy use pasture .  .Pasturl's grazed in the spring and again the fall had a crude protein  content of about seven to eight percent in August of 1967 compared to  ahout five percent crude protein for the pasture ungrazed in the spring  previous to the fall grazing trials. Spring grazing at light to moderate  levels stimulates new tiller development on at least part of the plants  in the pasture and this new leafy growth has a higher nutritive value  than the ungrazecl plants or tillers.  Impact of Grazing on Forage Production. Although climatic.: condi­tions  appear to have the greatest impact on cres ted wheatgrass growth  characteristics and forage production, previous and current grazing  trea tments also have ;m influence.  The three pastures grazed at the three intensities in the spring had  similar forage production in 1957. During periods of above average  precipitation (196~. 1963, 1964 and 1865), the calculated forage produc­tion  in the heavy use pasture was below that of the pastures used at  lesser intensities. No great difference in forage production occurred  among treatments in drier than average years (1960, 1861, 1966 and  1969). \tVhen moisture is deficient in May, as in the years indicated,  little plant growth occurs during May and consequently, grazing after  ?vlay 1 has little influence on the annual forage production. Annual  production in the heavy grazing intensity pasture averaged about 12  percent less than production in the light and moderate grazing treat­ments  over the thirteen-year period 1957-1969. The reduction in annual  production, however, was :36 percen t in the favorable growing year of  196.3.  Response of Crested Wheatgrass Stands Following a  Change in Management Practices  The grazing trials at the Point Springs e-.; perimental area show  that a stand of crested wheatgrass may persist for more than 15 years  under continuous heavy grazing in the spring of the year. This charac­teristic  of crested wheatgrass rangeland provides for flexibility in meet­ing  management objectives.  A portion of the pasture gmzed at the heavy intensity in the spring  received no grazing use in 18'68 or 1969. Prior to the start of the grazing  treatments in 1868, similar initial production occurred on the portion of  the pasture to be rested and the portion tbat would continue to receive  heavy spring grazi&lt;g. After one year of rest, the initial production  doubled on the rested portion compared to that on the portion l,';razed  heavily the prt&gt;vious spring, Tahle 5. Almost twice the total production  developed in 1Y69 on the rested area compared to the non-rested area.  10  Table 5. Forage production on May 1st and total forage production  on an area rested from grazing in 1968 and 1969 after 13  years of heavy grazing compared with an adjacent area con­tinuously  grazed heavily for 15 years.  Rested in 1968 and 1969  Grazed continuously in  the spring 1955-1969  Initial Forage  Production May I,  1968 1969  (Pounds per Acre)  Total Forage  Production  1968 1969  148 166 554 419  141 87 488 219  Data from the Bliss Point Seeding north of Bliss, Idaho show  comparative production rates in 1969 of 352 pounds per acre after two  years of rest, 400 pounds after four years and 506 pounds per acre  after five years of rest from grazing. The extremely poor growing  conditions in 1969 may have had an influence on the relative magni­tude  of the differences that occurred in this year.  The data at Point Springs suggest that similar results can be  obtained by alternating the timing of grazing in the spring from early  to late season in succeeding years. Although this grazing treatment has  been tested for only a short time, a positive response has developed.  The pasture used in early spring has sufficient time, in most years, for  regrowth following removal of the animals. The regrowth has a rela­tively  high nutrient content for· fall grazing and enhances animal pro­duction  in this period. It is recommended that the pasture grazed in the  late part of the spring season not be grazed in the fall in most years.  Since animal numbers are allocated on the basis of anticipated forage  production in the pasture grazed first, the late grazed pasture has  considerable residue remaining at the conclusion of the spring grazing  period. In the event that plant growth the following year is slow or  limited in development because of weather conditions, animals have a  forage supply with which to start the grazing season because of the  residue carry-over. In 1969 the pasture grazed first in 1968 and again  in the fall had 106 pounds of new growth and 48 pounds of forage  residue on t-,tiay 1. The pasture grazed late in the spring of 1968 had  167 pounds of new growth and 328 pounds of residue carry-over on  May 1, 1969.  Stocking Rates for Crested Wheatgrass Pastures  The light intensity of use treatment in the spring has been stocked  at an average of 1.5 acres per yearling animal month compared to 1.4  and 1.2 acres per yearlin12; animal month for the moderate and heavy  use pastures respectively, Table 6. Translating this to AUM's by assum­ing  that one yearling is 0.6 of an animal unit provides an average  stocking rate of 2..5 acres per AUM for light grazing and 2.1 acres per  AUM for heavy grazing in the spring period.  11  Table 6. Stocking rate in acres per yearling animal month and acres  per animal unit month for three intensities of use in the  spring season 1957-1969.  Light Moderate Heavy  Average  Acres/Yearling Animal Month 1.5 1.4 1.2  Acres/ Animal Unit Month 2.5 2.4 2.1  Range  Acres/Yearling Animal Month 2.5-0.8 2.3-0.7 1.6-0.7  Acres/ Animal Unit Month 4.2-1.4 3.9-1.2 2.8-1.2  Stocking rates have varied from 4.2 acres per AUM under light  grazing to 1.2 acres per AUM under moderate and heavy grazing over  the years of study.  In the latter years of study, however, the moderate and sometimes  the light grazing treatments required fe,ver acres per AUM than the  heavy grazing trea tment. This resulted from a relative decline in forage  production in the heavy intensity pasture and a larger forage residue  carryover in the light and moderately grazed pastures.  It is relatively easy under experimental conditions to vary the  number of animals in any year to fit the forage supply or anticipated  forage supply of the specific year. It is much more difficult to vary  animal numbers if the livestock operation depends on a yearly sustained  supply of AUM's of grazing. Some possible alternatives for meeting this  problem will be presented later in the paper.  Range Readiness  Animal welfare generally has more importance than other consid­erations  in determining the time to begin grazing on rangeland seeded  with crested wheatgrass. This plant species does not suffer to the  extent that blue-bunch wheatgrass does by early grazing. The growing  point of the stem remains at or below the plant crown level until early  May and consequently heavy demands on the organic reserves for the  initiation of new tiller growth are not made until this growing point has  been removed by grazing.  Most important to the time that grazing starts is the forage supplv  available. This will vary with elevation, spring and winter weather  conditions, previous grazing practices and other local factors. At Point  Springs forage production averaged 70-85 pounds per acre about the  first of April and growth during the month added four to six pounds  per day. If an animal requires about 25 pounds of dry matter per day,  each animal unit would have to harvest all the forage from an acre  within 3 to 4 days to satisfy the animal's daily dry matter requirement.  Assuming that a grazing animal's mouth is five to six inches wide, this  ""mower"" blade would have to travel a distance of about four to five  12  Table 7.

Cows have gained between one and two pounds per day in the  spring and 0.2 to 1.8 pounds in the summer. Fall gains ranged from a  loss of 0.4 pounds to a gain of 0.8 pounds per day. Calf gains ranged  from 1.5 to 2.0 pounds per day in the spring and were about two pounds  a day in the summer period. Calves ranged in weight from 135 to 200  pounds near the end of April and weighed in excess of 400 pounds  about the first of November.  Yearling animals generally gained in the neighborhood of two  pounds or more per day in the spring and about a pound per day in the  summer. Variations in forage supply, amount of green growth and other  factors caused considerable variation in fall ga ins.  Sufficient green growth of crested wheatgrass occurs in some years  to augment the nutritive value of the dry grass and animals respond  accordingly. For example, sufficient green growth developed in the fall  of 1968 to produce 1.8 pounds per day of gain on yearling animals  during the first 28 days of trial. Because of the quantity of green  material available in the fall of this year, the yearling animals consumed  much greater quantities of forage than normally in the fall. As a conse­quence,  a ll pastures were overstocked and gains diminished to 0 .. 5  pounds per day during the last 28 days of the trial period. Quantity and  not qua lity of forage became limiting in this case. Green material at  the beginning of the fall trials in 1965 was sufficient to produce high  animal gains. Cold temperatures-l6°F- early in the trial period dimin­ished  the nutritive value during the remainder of the trial period. The  15  miles to harvest 25 pounds of dry matter when forage production is 70  to 85 pounds per acre. It is not likely that the animal will be able to  satisfy dietary requirements under these conditions.  Animal requirements are more easily met at Point Springs in late  April and early !vlay when production is 200-300 pounds per acre and  rate of growth is much greater. Substantial amounts of plant residue  remaining from the previous year permit an earlier grazing start than  if little or no residue is present on the area.  Animal Response to Grazing Treatments  Animal gains and gains per: acre at the Point Springs experimental  pastures are shown in Figure 4. The values presented are for a six-year  period, 1960-1965. Data are available for a longer period of time on  most treatments but some change in pasture design in 1960 and a  change in some grazing treatments in 1965 limit comparability of all  treatments beyond 1965. Data over the longer period, 1957-1969, on the  unchanged treatments, however, show that the 1960-1965 data are  comparable to the longer term data.  As would be expected, animal gains decline and gains per acre  increase \Nith increasing grazing intensity. Animal gains in the spring  range between 111 pounds per animal under heavy grazing to 122  pounds \vith light grazing. Gains per acre in the spring average 48  pounds with light grazing compared to 53 pounds with heavy grazing.  Fall gains per animal varied from 25 pounds with heavy fall  grazing only to 34 pounds on pastures grazed the previous spring and  again in the fall. Fall gain per acre varied from nine pounds under light  grazing to 14 pounds with heavy grazing. Fall gain per acre was least  (eight pounds) in the pastures grazed the previous spring.  Of significance in the management of crested wheatgrass rangeland  is the higher animal gain in the spring and also in the fall on those  pastures grazed both spring and fall. Total gain per acre in pastures  grazed spring and fall is comparable to the moderately grazed spring  pasture. The less intense spring grazing on the spring-fall pastures main­tained  stand density and forage production and the combined spring-fall  grazing improved the nutritive quality of the forage in both seasons.  The combined spring and fall grazing also largely eliminated the  problem of ""wolf"" plants in the pasture area, consequently all plants  contribute to the forage supply.  The alternating spring grazing treatment has been tested for such  a short time that it is not possible to indicate animal response patterns  at the present time.  Some data are available that compare animal gains during various  seasons of the year, Table 7. These data have been obtained in a variety  of ways and serve only to illustrate comparative gains by each class  of animal in the three seasons. For example, in some years, the same  yearlings used in the spring grazing trials on the experimental pastures  were returned for the fall trials after grazing on privately owned crested  wheatgrass range during the summer. One owner has a permit on the  large Point Springs seeding for spring, summer and fall use; these  animals provide the data on cow and calf gains.  13  60  50  40  3~  20  10  Figure 4.

The forage produced in a year of deficient spring moisture is gener­ally  of good quality and satisfactory gains are made in the fall providing  stocking rates insure the animals an adequate quantity of forage.  Animal response reflects not only forage characteristics, climatic  conditions and stocking rate, but also the quality and previous manage­ment  of the animals. A comparison of yearling cattle of three owner­ships  show a maximum difference of 72 pounds on April 28, but a  difference of 111 pounds per animal on October 31, Table 8. Animals  of owner number two were smaller than the animals of owner three,  but gained at about the same rate through the period of grazing. All  animals grazed crested wheatgrass in the spring and fall. Owner two  grazed his animals on crested wheatgrass in the summer, owner one  and owner three had their animals on forage other than crested wheat­grass  during the summer.  Table 8.

Crested wheatgrass begins growth early in the spring. New growth  at Point Springs averages 70-85 pounds per acre in early April and  200 to 300 pounds per acre in early May.  2. Precipitation in April, May and June strongly influences yearly  forage production. Forage production may be four or five times as  great in a favorable year for plant growth as in a poor year. New  growth may occur in the fall with August and September precipita­tion.  Fall growth generally does not add substantially to the total  forage production under conditions existing at Point Springs but  nutritive value of the forage is enhanced.  3. Close continuous grazing throughout the growing season causes  stand density, uniformity of plant distribution and forage produc­tion  to decline compared to less intensive spring grazing levels.  16  4. Early spring grazing followed by removal of the animals prior to  the time that moisture becomes limiting on plant growth causes  nevv tillers to develop in some years. These new tillers are more  leafy and nutritious for summer or fall grazing. At Point Springs,  grazing until about May 20th followed by removal of the animals  provides the greatest opportunity fur such regrowth to develop .  . 5. Light spring grazing only of crested wheatgrass causes many of the  forage plants to become coarse and unattractive to grazing animals.  Nutritive value of the forage is less than under more intensive  levels of use.  6. Close grazing in the fall of the year causes growth to start at a  later date the following spring and fewer tillers develop on each  plant. With some stubble remaining after grazing in the fall, less  severe temperature extremes occur in the plant crown during the  winter. Favorable spring temperatures for plant growth occur  earlier when some stubble remains from the previous year. Moisture  relationships for plant growth may be enhanced hecause oE winter  snow accumulation in the ungrazed stubble.  7. Light fall grazing diminishes animal production and adds to the  ""wolf plant"" problem in crested wheatgrass stands.  8. Combining some level of summer or fall grazing with light or  modemte spring grazing maintains stand density, forage production  and increases nutritive value of the forage during all seasons  compared to grazing at light or moderate intensities in only one  season. Coarseness of the forage plant material and the number of  ""wolf plants"" is diminished with this treatment.  9. Crested wheatgrass stands provide highly nutritious forage in the  spring of the year. Yearling cattle gains generally exceed two  pounds a day from late April to late June. The reproductive rate  of cows and uniformity in size of the calves at weaning time has  improved at Point Springs during the years of study.  10. Early grazing of crested wheatgrass is more detrimental to animal  production than to plant production and vigor at the Point Spring's  area. Soil compaction considerations do not generally limit early  grazing.  11. Fifteen years of heavy spring grazing have not destroyed the stand  of grass in this treatment area at Point Springs. Forage production  has been reduced and stand density has declined, however.  12. Forage production and plant vigor have been restored to heavily  used crested wheatgrass stands by resting a year or two, by defer­ring  grazing during the growing season and/or alternating the  timing of grazing during the growing season.  13. Because of the growth characteristics, tolerance of heavy grazing  and rate at which crested wheatgrass improves vigor and produc­tion,  a number of alternative grazing programs can be devised.  Because of the flexibility that is possible on this forage type, man­agement  programs for other kinds of rangeland in the operation are  enhanced. Crested wheatgrass vegetation improves the potential  for stabilizing livestock numbers and increases the flexibility in  manipulating animals to achieve desired objectives.  17  14. Efficient management programs for crested wheatgrass vegetation  requires yearly on-the-ground decisions because of varying climatic  conditions, animal needs and program objectives.  Management Programs for Crested \Vheatgrass Rangeland  The followilng suggestions for the management of crested wheat­grass  rangeland are based on the experience gained at the Point Springs  experimental area in southern Idaho. Such programs should be modified  to meet changing conditions and resource management objectives.  One Unit Grazing Management  If the type of grazing program requires that the same area be  grazed about the same time of year every year, stocking rate should be  at some moderate level. On the Point Springs seeding this would be  about 2 to 3 acres per animal unit month when grazed from approxi­mately  May lst until the desired level of use is achieved. A higher  stocking rate may be possible when the grazing capactiy is obtained by  grazing fewer animals for a longer period of time. This approach pro­vides  the plants a greater leaf surface area to function in plant growth  during the growing season. A higher concentration of animals for a  shorter period of time will lovver forage production approximately 20-30  percent and thus require more acreage to achieve the desired animal  production.  \Vhen the area is to be used both spring and fall as a source of  forage for livestock, stocking at a rate of 3 to 4 acres per animal unit  month in the spring will normally leave adequate forage for fall grazing.  The quality of fall forage is enhanced nutritively by regrowth that  occurs during the spring period. In most years at Point Springs, animal  gain and gain per acre in the fall is much improved in those pastures  grazed as indicated above in contrast to pastures grazed only in the fall.  Stand vigor and plant density have been maintained under this program  of management. Fall stocking rate can be adjusted, in numbers or time,  to remove the desired amount of forage. With fall grazing, the develop­ment  of ""wolf plants"" is minimized or eliminated.  This program of grazing management provides stability for the  livestock operation primarily through a stocking n1.te that can be accom­modated  in the driest years experienced at Point Springs. In years with  below average growing conditions, the amount of fall grazing may be  reduced by selling early or providing additional feed or forage areas.  Fall grazing may be increased by staying longer and/ or holding calves  longer in years of above average production.  Two Unit Grazing Management  A two unit crested wheatgrass range area provides more flexibility in  manipulating animals to attain optimum forage production and conse­quently  optimum animal output. With a two unit area, one unit is grazed  18  early one year and late the second year. The sequence of grazing, i.e.  early and late, is alternated on the two units in a two year pattern.  The unit grazed early one year will be grazed late the next year and  vice versa.  Under this program, grazing should stop on the field grazed late  when about one-half of the forage is used. The unused forage will  provide material that can be utilized the next year when this unit is  grazed early in the spring. Initial growth will be greater and more rapid  on this unit than on the field grazed early the previous year and again  in the fall. The unit grazed first in 1968 and again in the fall of that  year had produced 106 pounds of new herbage on April 26 in 1969  contrasted to 167 pounds of new forage in the field grazed late in the  spring of 1968. A field deferred from grazing in 1968 after 13 years of  heavy spring grazing had an initial production of 165 pounds of new  herbage compared to 82 pounds on the unrested adjacent area.  The field grazed early may be used again later, or in the fall, if  regrowth has occurred. This provides good quality fall forage and  animals respond well to this treatment.  Stockinp; rates can generally be somewhat higher than under con­tinuous  grazing. In years of below average precipitation, the production  in the unit grazed second is known at the time ,grazing starts and the live­stock  operator has time to make required adjustments. \Nith the two  unit system and recognizing the fact that crested wheatgrass will toler­ate  at least a year or two of severe grazing, drastic adjustments in  animal numbers should not be necessary. Adjustments in timing of use  can be made to restore vigor to the units in those years of average or  above average growing conditions. Such adjustments must be based on  field examination and requires application of the art of range manage­ment.  Three or Four Unit Grazing Management  More intensive management and greater flexibility in the alterna­tives  of management programs are provided with three or four units  that are fenced separately. Under a grazing program of this type, one  unit each vear is deferred from grazing through the growing season.  The unit deferred is alternated among the three (or four) units each  vear so that once in three (or four) vears each unit is deferred during  the ,growing season. The other units- are alternated between early and  late grazing during the growing season so that no unit is grazed at the  same time of the season in successive years.  Stocking rates on the Point Springs seeding have been about 2 acres  per AUM during the four years that a four unit program has been  tested. Stocking rate on these nastures used in the spring is between  3 ancJ 4 acres per AUM depending on forage production and Jl/z to 3%  acres per AUM in the fall. Almost any degree of grazing is permitted  in the fall except on the deferred unit. About one-half of the fora .l!e is  left as carryover until the next spring when this unit will be grazed first.  Adjustments can easily be made in this program as required by  climatic conditions, animal requirements and changing management  objectives.",,,2015-03-10,2015-03-10,http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/rangecoll/id/49,49,54.pdf,/rangecoll/image/54.pdf,rangecoll49

Peters, Univ. of Idaho  Stephen c. Bunting, Univ. of Idaho  28 Jan. 1993  2  INTRODUCTION  Prior to Euro-American settlement of the Snake River Plains,  plant communities were dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia  tridentata), with interspersed bunchgrasses (Stipa and Festuca)  (Hironaka et al. 1983). Disturbance in this region was believed  to have been fairly low, with fire having the greatest impact  when it occurred (Peters and Bunting in press). Following fire,  these communities may have been dominated by annual fescues  (Vulpia spp.) and early seral perennial grasses, such as  squirreltail (Sitanion bystrix), and replaced later by the  sagebrush and late seral bunchgrasses. With the advent of  farming and cattle grazing, and with the introduction of weedy  annual species, the successional pattern changed. Initial  dominance by annual forbs, such as Russian thistle (Salsola kali)  and mustards (Sisymbrium spp. and Descurainia spp.) followed by  long-term dominance by annual grasses, mainly cheatgrass (Bromus  tectorum) has occurred on many disturbed sites. Piemeisel (1945,  1951} observed that this change in annual dominance generally  occurred over a five year period, and would be repeated with  disturbance.  In the Snake River Plains region, many farms were abandoned  during the early 1900's because of low crop productivity and  drought. These abandoned farmlands, and other degraded areas,  supported a weedy cover that provided large host areas for the  beet leafhopper (Eutettix tenellus) a vector of the virus that  causes curly top disease in sugar beets (Piemeisel 1938). The  initial study resulting in the establishment of the exclosures  was developed by Piemeisel to study the relationship between the  weedy cover of the abandoned farmlands and populations of the  beet leafhopper. This initial study evolved into a long-term  successional study that has been continued by researchers at the  University of Idaho.  METHODS  3  To study the relationship between the weedy cover and the  beet leafhopper, five plots were originally established  (Piemeisel 1938). Today, two are still intact and managed in  cooperation by the Bureau of Land Management and the University  of Idaho. These exclosures occur within the Artemisia tridentata  spp. wyomingensis/Stipa thurberiana habitat type (Hironaka et al.  1983). Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa secunda), streambank wheatgrass  (Agropyron riparium) and squirreltail are common species in this  habitat type. The soils of these sites have been classified as  coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Xerollic Camborthid, Typic Camborthid  or Durixerollic Camborthid (Hironaka et al. 1983).  The Burley exclosure, located approximately 7 miles  southwest of the city of Burley, was established in 1930 on a  farm abandoned in 1916 (Piemeisel 1938). In June 1938, this  exclosure was additionally fenced to exclude jackrabbits. The  Castleford exclosure, located approximately 15 miles southeast of  the town of Castleford, was established in April 1931 (Piemeisel  1938). This farm was abandoned in 1920. In 1944, the exclosure  was additionally fenced against jackrabbits.  Plots were set up on 40 acres to include 1/2 cropland and  1/2 sagebrush. However, on the Castleford exclosure, the split  was slightly more than 20 acres of sagebrush. Transects were  permanently established and numbered posts were set up on a  lOOxlOO' grid. Sample quadrats were established on either side  of the transect posts 10m on a diagonal (Fig. 1). Sample  quadrats were initially marked with small wooden stakes. In  1992, the near corner of each sample plot was re-marked with  looped steel stakes. Also in 1992, permanent plots were  established within the sagebrush portion of the exclosures.  4  Density data were collected initially only within 25x25cm  quadrats, but in 1948 was expanded to include lxlm quadrats for  better representation of the perennial species, primarily  sagebrush. The density of the annual species is under-estimated  since actual counts of the plants in the 25x25cm plot were  suspended after the first 25 plants were counted. This was done  to emulate the work done by Dr. Piemeisel and also to save time.  The density of streambank wheatgrass, a rhizomatous species, was  also under-estimated. Analysis of the density of streambank  wheatgrass was based on the number of clumps for this species.  Individual stems were counted up to 25, then discountinued to  save time. Frequency data were also obtained for each species.  Sampling in 1992 included density and frequency in 25x25cm and  lxlm plots, and was conducted in both the ""weedy"" and ""sagebrush""  portion of each exclosure.  CLXHATB  The climate of this area is characterized by low rainfall  (mean annual precipitation = 2.5 em) and dry, hot summers.  Precipitation occurs primarily in the winter months (Figure 2).  For the years that data have been collected, average growing  season (April - August) temperature, average growing season  precipitation, and winter (October - March) precipitation is  presented in Figure 2 (US Weather Bureau Data).  RESULTS  BURLEY EXCLOSURE - ""WEEDY"" PORTION  5  In 1938, the vegetation on the Burley site was dominated by  Russian thistle (76 plantsfm2  ) and two mustards (118 plantsfm2 )  (Table 1). Cheatgrass replaced Russian thistle by 1945  (Piemeisel 1951), and has maintained a density of more than 100  plantsfm2 since 1948 (Table 1). Perennial grasses, as a whole,  have maintained densities between 50 and 90 plantsfm2 , with the  sampling in 1954 having the highest density (Table 1). Density  of species groupings have shifted from annual herbs (1937 and  1938) to annual/perennial grass (1948-1992) (Figure 3).  Sagebrush density declined from approximately 8 plantsfm2 in 1937  to 1 plantfm2 in 1992 (Figure 4). A comparison of annual vs.  perennial density (Figure 5) indicated the change in life-form  dominance: by 1992, perennial species occur in higher densities  than annual species.  Frequency analysis (Figure 6) showed that the first  6  perennial species to increase on these plots was squirreltail ,  which by 1951 occurred in 60% of the plots sampled (Table 2) and  maintained a consistent frequency until 1992. Sampling in 1992  indicated that Sandberg's bluegrass and streambank wheatgrass had  a 3-fold increase in frequency (Figure 6). The dominance of  sagebrush on this portion of the site is not reflected by  frequency analysis.  BURLEY EXCLOSURE - ""SAGEBRUSH"" PORTION  Changes in the community composition of the sagebrush  portion have occurred, but data are not available for comparison.  The only record of vegetation changes are in the old photographs  of Dr. Piemeisel (stored at the University of Idaho) and slides  of the area taken by Dr. M. Hironaka (University of Idaho).  Fires have occurred on the exclosure in the early 1960's and  again in the mid 1980's. Thus, the current community composition  reflects the successional changes after disturbance. Figure 7  illustrates the density of perennial species within the sagebrush  portion. This portion of the site is dominated by streambank  wheatgrass and Sandberg's bluegrass. Cheatgrass density,  extrapolated from the 25x25cm data, was greater than 107  plantsjm2  •  CASTLEFORD EXCLOSURE - ""WEEDY"" PORTION  In the years since the Castleford exclosure has been  7  exclosed to cattle and jackrabbits, the dominant species has been  cheatgrass. In the earlier years of the study (1938}, Russian  thistle dominated (11.7 plantsfm2  ), but in later years, it was  replaced by tumblemustard and cheatgrass (1943) (Table 3).  Russian thistle has not been recorded on this site since 1945.  The results from the 1992 sampling indicated an increase in  salsify (Tragopogon), Sandberg's bluegrass, and crested  wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) (Figure 8). Combined, the  perennial grasses had a density of 3.4 plantsfm2 (Table 3). This  value may be somewhat misleading, in that the perennial species  occurred in isolated dense patches and were not uniformly  distributed on the plot. Prior seeding experiments of Dr.  Piemeisel's account for part of the increase in crested  wheatgrass, but more importantly, part has been the natural  establishment of seedlings from the surrounding crested  wheatgrass allotment. No sagebrush were observed within this  half of the exclosure.  Analysis of frequency data (Table 4, Figure 9) also  indicates the change in community composition of the ""weedy""  portion of this exclosure. However, it is clear that cheatgrass  remains the dominant species on this site (Figure 9).  CASTLEFORD EXCLOSURE - ""SAGEBRUSH"" PORTION  Community composition change of this portion of the  Castleford exclosure appears to have been slight since the early  1930's. It is unfortunate that there is very little data on the  sagebrush portion of both exclosures, and old photographs and  slides are the only method of comparison. The perennial grass  species are scattered in the interspaces between the dominant  sagebrush, which form a fairly dense stand (approx. 3 plantsfm2)  (Figure 10). A portion of the sagebrush, along an old ditch or  roadway, has died back. Within this area, cheatgrass and other  annual species dominate. Throughout the whole ""sagebrush""  portion, cheatgrass had an average density of 80 plantsfm2  (extrapolated from 25x25cm data).  DrscussroN  BURLEY EXCLOSURE  8  Successional changes on the abandoned farmland (""weedy"")  portion of this exclosure have been well documented (Piemeisel  1951, Hironaka and Tisdale 1963). The initial vegetation was  dominated by annual forbs (Russian thistle and mustards) and  those were replaced by annual grasses, chiefly cheatgrass, but  also the native annual fescue. squirreltail was the primary  perennial grass to establish in the cheatgrass communities  (Piemeisel 1945, 1951, Hironaka and Tisdale 1963). The frequency  of streambank wheatgrass had increased in the years between 1948  and 1951, but had declined by 1954, and since then has increased  to approximately 50%. Changes in the perennial grass component  have occurred over the past 50 years, but were not unexpected. A  decrease in squirreltail, and a concurrent increases in  bluegrass, riparian wheatgrass and needlegrasses indicate a later  seral stage community, as evidenced by the low density of large  sagebrush •  9  Sagebrush had established in the ""weedy"" portion by 1937,  but since then the density has declined. This phenomenon may be  due to the self-thinning of maturing sagebrush. The sagebrush  present at the 1992 sampling were quite large, and very few small  sagebrush were observed. It may be that sagebrush experiences  population cycling, such that recruitment does not occur until  the mature plants become quite decadent, or until some  disturbance opens up the community.  Cheatgrass remains very prominent on both portions of this  exclosure, but has been limited to slightly more than 50% of the  sampled plots. Total preclusion of cheatgrass by the perennial  species will likely not occur, as localized disturbances will  always create openings for this species which has an ample seed  source from the surrounding farmlands.  CASTLEFORD EXCLOSURE  Community changes on the ""weedy"" portion of the Castleford  exclosure have been slow. This site is still dominated by  cheatgrass, with widely interspersed crested wheatgrass. No  sagebrush has become established in the last several decades.  This lack of colonization by sagebrush, or other perennial  grasses may be due to the lack of seed source from the  surrounding vegetation. Examination of early photographs  indicates that the vegetation surrounding the exclosure was  10  dominated by annual species, and then the area was converted to a  crested wheatgrass allotment. The wind pattern at this site  comes from a southerly direction, and thus the seed source from  the sagebrush and perennial grasses, which lay to the north, are  not available. It is not known if sagebrush are being  established outside the north end of the exclosure in the crested  wheatgrass allotment. In May 1992, there was very little  vegetation surrounding the exclosure due to intense grazing of  the crested wheatgrass (in June 1991, the allotment had not been  grazed)  Soil disturbance, by animal species within the ""sagebrush""  portion, open areas for colonization by annual species. A  constant seed source, from both within and outside the exclosure,  guarantee the presence of annual species for many years to come.  The dominance of cheatgrass in the ""weedy"" portion of the  exclosure, and the dominance of sagebrush in the ""sagebrush""  portion make this an ideal place to study differences in nutrient  cycling between annual dominated communities and perennial shrub  dominated communities.  11  Literature Cited  Hironaka, M., M.

Kingery, Carol Boyd  and Peggy E. Kingery  Introduction  Grazing of forested lands in the Pacific  Northwest has been included in forest resource  management strategies since the turn of the  century (Tisdale 1961 ). Many of the areas grazed  are transitory in nature, that is, sites where the  natural forest community has been removed due to  harvesting, fire or some other disturbance. Seral  shrubs and herbaceous vegetation now flourish.  While successional processes are restoring the site  to forestland, such areas can provide considerable  support of animal use for up to 40 years (Kingery  1987). This fact may have considerable appeal to  private land owners, especially during times when  the timber market is poor (Adams 1975).  As on traditional rangelands, it is necessary to  monitor vegetation on transitory rangeland to  ensure proper use of the resource and attainment  of management objectives. Proper use is defined  by the Society for Range Management as ""the  degree and time of use of current year's growth  which, if continued, will either maintain or improve  the range condition consistent with conservation  of other natural resources."" (Range Term Glossary  Committee 1989). Proper use, when applied to an  individual species, refers to the season and  amount of use that can occur without interfering  with that species' ability to provide for its own  needs. When applied to a plant community,  proper use refers to the season and level of use  that can occur without jeopardizing the long-term  health of the plant community (Stoddart et al.  1975). When land is not managed for proper use,  plant vigor and forage production can decrease  and the trend in range condition can decline. In  contrast, an increase in the food manufacturing  leaf surface, an improvement in litter cover, and  an increase in forage quality and quantity result  when proper use guidelines are followed.  On transitory rangelands, especially in northern  Idaho, the primary use is generally for timber  production. As such, tree seedling establishment  and maintenance of range condition are the chief  concerns. On these sites, therefore, proper use is  1  the degree and time of use of forage plants that  will not only maintain or improve the condition of  the forage resource, but also be consistent with  goals for forest regeneration.  For proper use to be achieved, animal use  must be monitored. While there are many methods  of estimating forage utilization, most have been  developed for use on traditional rangelands and  may not be completely applicable to transitory  rangelands. In addition, they can be time­consuming  and require extensive training to  produce acceptable results. For these reasons,  there is a need for a reliable procedure to estimate  utilization that is accurate, rapid and easily  learned. The grazed-class method developed by  Schmutz, Holt and Michaels (1963) meets this  need.  Background for the Grazed-Class  Method  The grazed-class method of estimating forage  utilization was developed for and tested on arid  rangelands in the Southwest, but appears to have  considerable potential in forested settings of the  Pacific Northwest as well (Boyd 1987). It was  designed to provide range resource managers with  an accurate and easy-to-use tool to monitor  livestock utilization of selected forage species.  The procedure is based on the concept that when  one or more key species of an area representative  of a larger range type have been properly utilized,  optimum use of that rangeland has been made  (Stoddart et al. 1975). The method classifies  grazed plants into utilization classes, based on the  percent of total plant weight removed. The  classes are 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90-percent use  (Fig. 1 ). Photographic guides, developed from  height-weight relations of the chosen species (Fig.  2), are used to guide the examiner in placing  grazed plants into their respective utilization  classes.  The photo guides for use on transitory  rangelands were developed according to the  procedure of Schmutz (1978) with some  modifications. These modifications were  necessary because of the variability of growth  characteristics encountered within the plant  species tested. This variability was primarily due to  the heterogeneous growing conditions typical of  forest environments as compared to the more  homogeneous conditions found in the Southwest  desert grasslands for which the photo guides were  originally developed.  0% 10% 30% 50% 70% 90%  Figure 1. Utilization classes based on the percent of total plant weight removed.  Development of Photo Guides for  Transitory Rangelands  The factors involved in choosing the key  management area and for selecting the key  species to monitor are critical for the development  of the photo guides. According to Schmutz  (1978), key management areas for livestock  production are located at intermediate distances  from water but not where livestock naturally  congregate. Key species are defined as those that  are both abundant in the plant community and  important components of the livestock diet.  Determination of Key Management Areas  For purposes of developing and testing the  photo guides for transitory rangelands, key areas  were located in the Douglas-fir/ninebark  (Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus malvaceus),  Douglas-fir/snowberry (Pseudotsuga  menziesii/Symphoricarpos a/bus), grand  fir/queenscup beadlily (Abies grandis/Ciintonia  uniflora), and western redcedar/queenscup beadlily  (Thuja plicata/Ciintonia uniflora) habitat types  (Boyd 1987). The four habitat types selected  represent a wide range of environmental  conditions common to transitory rangelands in the  Pacific Northwest, and possess a high potential for  both timber and forage production. The specific  sites for observation were selected primarily for  the variability in the vegetation; however,  differences in slope, soil type and aspect were also  considered.  Determination of Key Management  Species  Forage species meeting the criteria of  abundance and dietary importance for key species  designation in the Douglas-fir, grand fir and  western redcedar habitat types are: Idaho fescue  2  (Festuca idahoensis), meadow foxtail {A/opecurus  pratensis), timothy (Phleum pratense), bluebunch  wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), pinegrass  (Calamagrostis rubescens), slender hairgrass  (Deschampsia elongata), and orchardgrass  (Dactylis glomerata). The selections were guided  by personal experiences and the suggestions of  range users and management agency personnel.  1-  J:  38  25  20  S2 15 w  J:  10  5  Height-weight curve  o ro ~ ~ ~ ~ oo m oo oo m  WEIGHT  Figure 2. Height of typical grass plant with  corresponding percent weights representing the grazed  classes.  Photo Guide Development  The most important consideration in  developing accurate photo guides is a close  correlation between grazed-class percentages and  the height-weight relations of the plant  photographed.  To begin, an ""average plant"" for each species  was determined. Eight to 12 plants representative  of the species and within a normal range of  growth (eliminating height and production  extremes) were collected. The weight of each  plant was determined at specified heights by  clipping and weighing; the averages of these  measurements were used as the basis for height­weight  curves for each plant. To determine the  height of a specific grazed class (0, 10, 30, 50,  70 and 90-percent weight removed), the height of  the ""average plant"" corresponding to that grazed  class was used.  Once an ""average plant"" for a given species  was determined, a representative of that species  was located in the management area. The plant  was clipped to the heights corresponding to the  various grazed classes. Photographs were taken  of the plant at each height. All plant clippings  were individually bagged and weighed to  determine the weight distribution for the different  grazed classes. For the plants photographed,  height was plotted against weight percent. This  graph was compared with the graph of the  ""average plant.""  Due to a large variation in growing conditions  at the sites, the photographed plants often did not  exactly fit the height-weight curve of the ""average  plant."" To account for this variation, 99-percent  confidence limits were used with the regression  line of the graph to produce a range of values for  the ""average plant"" (Fig. 3). If the values of the  photographed plant were within the confidence  limits of the height-weight curve for a given  species, it was accepted as a representation of the  ""average."" The photo guide was then created  from the photograph series to represent different  grazing intensities.  Applications for the Grazed-Class  Photo Guides  Utilization  The grazed-class photo guides provide a  standard for plant height comparison. Because the  photo guides estimate utilization based on the  amount of forage removed, variations in height  (and weight) due to irregular plant use are  3  automatically adjusted for by the eye, while  variations in height growth due to site  characteristics or seasonal precipitation can be  disregarded (Schmutz 1978). In turn, the  accuracy of the estimate is increased and the  required calculations are reduced.  Assessing proper use  The upper limit of livestock utilization on  transitory sites will vary, depending upon the  stage of reforestation and forage availability. In  the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest, the  first four years for naturally regenerated tree  seedlings and the first two years for transplanted  tree seedlings are generally considered the most  critical periods (Roath and Krueger 1982).  livestock utilization during these critical periods  should be well distributed and not exceed 25% to  30% of the standing crop (Kingery et al. 1987).  As the tree seedlings mature, livestock utilization  can be increased in accordance with forage  availability. Studies in central and northern Idaho  and in Oregon have indicated that utilization not  exceeding 60% will maintain desirable forage  conditions in most transitory range settings during  the forest rotation period (Kingery 1987; Young et  al. 1967; Doescher et al. 1987).  30~------------------------·  25\  \  \  20 \ \ - \ \ c \  :.:=..  1-  :::c 15  ~  w  :::c  10  5  \  \ \  \ \  \ \  \ \  \ '  ' ' ' ' '  10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100  WEIGHT(%)  Figure 3. Height-weight curve with 99% confidence  limits.  Other Estimates Which May Be Obtained  As discussed by Schmutz (1978), the grazed  class method can also be used to estimate  stocking rates, grazing capacity, distribution of  grazing and economics of range improvements.  These parameters have not as yet been evaluated  in transitory rangeland settings, however. Possible  applications of this method on forested sites  would be to make interim seasonal adjustments in  stocking rates; to determine grazing distribution  problems due to water source locations, soil,  slope, etc.; and to aid in the assessment of  economic benefits of improvements made to  increase grazing capacity.  Range of Application  While the photo guides were developed for  seven important forage species in the four habitat  types studied (Boyd 1987), they can also provide  a reliable index for livestock utilization in other  transitory rangeland types. Our observations  support those of Schmutz (1978) in that the photo  guides are not restricted to only the community  types in which they were developed. There is  generally as much variation in plant form on a  given site as between sites, and these variations  are averaged out with large samples.  The grazed-class method is an accurate and  rapid means of estimating forage utilization, and  its application for monitoring utilization is shown  to be well suited to transitory rangelands in the  Intermountain West.  Instructions for Use  The sampling procedure for this method is fast  (a 1 00-plant sample requires from 30 to 60  minutes); therefore, it is possible to sample  multiple sites in a short time. The calculations to  determine utilization are simple and can be done  on location or later. If the area to be sampled is  large, it may be necessary to stratify it into  smaller, more homogeneous sampling units based  primarily on differences in vegetation and soils.  Each unit would then be sampled independently.  One species should be sampled at a time using a  toe-pace transect set diagonally across the  sampling unit. This technique reduces the  probability of sampling the same plant twice and  includes most of the variability within the unit.  To estimate current utilization, either 50 or  1 00 samples of individual plants of each key  species may be used. By referring to the photo  guides the appendix, determine which grazed-class  the plant falls into and record that in the dot count  block on the data sheet (Fig. 4). After the desired  4  number of plants are recorded, convert the tallies  to percentage of grazed plants by classes. If 50  samples were taken, double the dot tallies for the  recorded number. Then record the number of  plants occurring in each grazed class in the column  labelled •No. By Class• (C). Next, multiply the  grazed-class percent (P) by (C) to obtain the  number by class percent and record this figure in  the column labelled •No. By Class %• (CP).  Finally, divide the total amount in column (CP) by  the total amount in column (C) to obtain the  average utilization of the plant species.  Very little formal training is required to use the  grazed-class method effectively. Instruction  should include an explanation of the theory behind  the method as well as practice sessions in the  field. According to Schmutz (1978), consistent  results can be obtained with only two hours  experience, although personnel inexperienced with  the procedure or personnel who have not used the  method for some time often underestimated use of  the heavier grazed plants. Studies in northern  Idaho have shown that inexperienced samplers  overestimated utilization when livestock use of the  site was minimal (Boyd 1987).•  UTILIZATION STUDY DATA  GRAZED CLASS METHOD  I I  !Studv Number I Date I Examiner  1 Allotment Name & Number  I  IKind/Class of Livestock !Period of Use  iLeQ:al Des&lt; tr_intion  Key Species Key Species Key Species  Grazed  Class INo by INo X INo by INo X INo by INo X  Percents Dot !Class !Class J Dot !Class !Class J Dot I Class I Class J  (p) Count I (C) I(C)(p) Count I (C) I(C)(p) Count I (C) I(C)(p)  I I I I I I  0 I I I I I I  I I I I I I  I I I I I I  10 I I I I I I  I I I 1 I I  I I I I I I  30 I I I I I I  I I J I I I  I I I I I I  50 I I I I I I  I I J I I I  I I I I I I  70 I I I I I I  I I I I I I  I I I I I I  90 I I I I I I  I I I I I I  I I I I I I  Totals I I Totals I I Totals I I  I I I I I I  Ave. :E (C) (P) Ave. Ave.  Util. = =-= Util. = -= Util. : -=  :E (C)  Notes:  Figure 4.

Activities that affect a threatened or endangered species or its habitat may need to undergo formal evaluation.  Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances (CCAA) are voluntary landowner agreements where lands are managed to remove or reduce threats to candidate or listed  species.  It is not easy to predict how grazing, development, or recreation on rangelands may need to be altered or curtailed if a species is listed under the ESA.  How Can the Endangered Species Act Affect Rangeland Activities?  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 with the simple goals of protecting species in danger of becoming extinct and preserving their habitat. However, the ESA can feel like a cloud of uncertainty hovering over many rangeland users, including ranchers, because of the complexity of conserving species, the uncertainty and fears over how the ESA may restrict land uses, and the consequences of violating the law. This document explains how species are evaluated for listing under the ESA and suggests options for landowners who want to avoid ESA-imposed restrictions on uses and activities.  What is the Endangered Species Act?  The ESA was enacted to protect and preserve species in danger of extinction and recover those species to a point where the protections of the ESA are no longer necessary. Two federal agencies are responsible for enforcing the ESA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for terrestrial and fresh-water organisms including plants, wildlife, and fish. The National Marine Fisheries Service oversees marine life, including anadromous fish (like salmon), which spend a portion of their life in the ocean.  Both of these agencies are referred to collectively as the “Service” in this document.  Any person or organization can petition the Service to consider a species for protection under the ESA. If the best scientific information indicates a species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, a species may be designated as endangered. If a species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range, it may be designated as threatened. The Service also maintains a list of candidate species (warranted for listing but precluded due to other listing priorities) which are being studied and considered for listing under the ESA. Candidate species are still managed by the individual states and carry with them no ESA protections.  The ESA makes it illegal to take, harm, or harass a threatened or endangered species. The term take is broadly defined under the ESA as “[to] harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or attempt to engage in any such conduct.” An animal does not have to be killed for take to occur. Take could also occur through detrimental changes to important habitat in a way that impairs the breeding, feeding, and sheltering of a species, possibly leading to its death or impairing its ability to reproduce. Ranching activities such as grazing, haying, mowing, herbicide spraying, burning, water sources development, or fence building could be restricted depending on the species and its habitat requirements or behavior. Specific recreational activities could similarly be restricted if they could result in take. Moreover, “ignorance is not bliss” when it comes to the ESA. Individuals are not exempt from consequences of take just because they did not know their activities could lead to take of a listed species. If convicted, penalties for take violations could include civil or criminal fines from $25,000 to $50,000 and could even result in a prison sentence.  How does the Endangered Species Act apply to private lands?  Any activity that takes or harms a listed species on public or private lands is illegal under the ESA unless the activity is explicitly listed as exempt in a special federal permit or authorization. Rangeland uses such as recreation, grazing, and vegetation management could potentially be prohibited or restricted to protect a threatened or endangered species. Private landowners may request information from the Service, and related federal and state wildlife agencies, to determine if listed species occur on their property, and how to avoid violating the ESA.  Not all private lands are treated the same with respect to the ESA. Projects involving federal permits or federal assistance (e.g., USDA Farm Bill program funds) require review to ensure that activities are not negatively impacting any listed species. This requirement stems from language in the ESA prohibiting federal agencies from permitting, funding, or conducting activities that may take a listed species or jeopardize its existence. For example, a producer with private land enrolled in a program receiving federal assistance has a federal nexus that requires consultation with the Service about curtailing or modifying activities to minimize impact on listed species (see “Section 7 Consultation”, discussed below). Rangeland management activities may need to be halted, interrupted, limited, or revised if these activities are supported by federal funds and also viewed as jeopardizing the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species.  What can be done to prevent or prepare for a listing?  One way to avoid confronting ESA restrictions is to improve habitat or change activities preemptively to benefit specific plants or animals in order to keep them from becoming listed as threatened or endangered. Beneficial actions could include controlling invasive plants, maintaining important nesting or foraging habitat, and removing structures that interfere with animal movements. Several federal and state programs provide information and financial support for habitat conservation efforts that proactively address species of concern.  The Service can develop plans and sign agreements, called Candidate Conservation Agreements (CCA), with individuals or groups that manage or own private or public lands to encourage conservation efforts. In these agreements, the Service works with partners to implement conservation activities that improve habitat and/or reduce threats to candidate species.  The Service can work with landowners to develop conservation plans for species that are not currently listed and offer assurances that reduce ESA restrictions if the species eventually becomes listed. A Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) is a voluntary agreement between private landowners and the Service in which landowners agree to manage their lands in such a way as to remove or reduce threats to candidate species at risk of being listed as endangered or threatened. Landowners entering into a CCAA are granted two basic assurances. First, if the species is ultimately listed under the ESA, the landowner cannot be guilty of a take that inadvertently occurs during activities that comply with the CCAA. In these situations, landowners will be granted an incidental take permit for activities that unintentionally cause harm during an otherwise lawful and authorized activity. Examples of incidental take include the animal being hit by ranch vehicles, killed by haying equipment, or injured if they strike fences. Second, the landowner does not have to devote more resources or engage in activities for the sake of species recovery beyond those requirements mutually agreed to in the CCAA, even if new information about the species comes to light. This is called the no surprises policy.  Another benefit of CCAAs is that they can be developed for a range of ownerships, including leased private lands, state lands, or common allotments of state or private lands so that provisions of the CCAA are seamless across land ownerships. Developing a CCAA across state or private land can simplify complex regulations specific to different ownerships and ensure that activities can continue uninterrupted if a species addressed in the CCAA is subsequently listed.  The many nuances of rangeland management and conserving listed species require CCAAs to be developed on a case-by-case basis for specific properties. While CCAAs can offer valuable assurances to private landowners, they require significant money and time to develop (typically six months to several years, depending on complexity). Umbrella CCAA templates have been created to simplify the process by outlining primary threats and conservation measures for an individual species across a large area. Farmers and ranchers can use these templates to create site-specific plans to establish a CCAA. An example is the “Greater Sage-Grouse Umbrella CCAA for Wyoming Ranch Management” (www.fws.gov/wyominges/Pages/LandownerTools/CCAA/CCAA_GSG.html).  Rangeland owners concerned about a species being considered for listing may also participate in a Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) conservation agreement to gain a level of regulatory certainty if the species is listed. The WLFW is a partnership between the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service where landowners receive assurance that they will be allowed incidental take if the species is inadvertently harmed while implementing conservation practices covered in the WLFW agreement. There are currently seven species for which WLFW programs exist, including the Sage-Grouse Initiative (SGI), for which there are 39 approved management actions that vary from grazing systems to firebreaks. The WLFW agreements differ from CCAAs in that they only cover specific land management actions and projects, whereas a CCAA is a comprehensive land-based management plan.  What happens after a species is listed?  Nobody can predict with certainty if a species that has been petitioned for listing under the ESA will be listed. However, once a species is listed as either threatened or endangered, ESA protections are immediately in effect and taking or harming the species becomes illegal. Upon a listing, federal agencies must examine all activities on federal lands, and those activities for which they fund or issue permits on private lands, to ensure those activities do not adversely affect the species or its habitat. Federally funded projects and activities on federal land that are likely to affect the species must cease until the agency overseeing the activity evaluates its potential effects and consults the Service to determine necessary changes, incidental take permits, or prohibitions.  After a species is listed, the Service has the option of designating critical habitat to specify geographic areas essential for conservation of the species. Critical habitat can be designated on any area, regardless of ownership, even if it is not federal land. However, designations of critical habitat only restrict federal actions, or federally funded activities, and have no effect on state or private lands that do not have a federal nexus.  How can an ESA listing affect grazing and other uses of federal lands?  Any rangeland activity that requires a permit on federal lands, including grazing, obligates the agency permitting the activity to evaluate how that proposed activity will likely affect a listed species and its habitat. The responsible agency (e.g., the Bureau of Land Management, or the U.S. Forest Service) then issues a Biological Assessment summarizing whether a potential activity or project is likely to impact the listed species. Subsequent steps based on this determination are listed below.  Is there a difference between how endangered and threatened species are addressed under the ESA?  Both threatened and endangered species are protected from take under the ESA. However, there is an important difference in how the Service regulates forms of take that are allowed or prohibited for threatened compared to endangered species. Rules, called 4(d) rules, apply only to threatened species and get their name from Section 4(d) of the ESA. These 4(d) rules provide the Service flexibility to allow some activities having a minor effect on a threatened species to continue while focusing attention on the threats that have a stronger influence on species’ recovery. For example, when the Lesser Prairie-Chicken was listed as threatened, 4(d) rules allowed activities such as brush management, grazing, construction and maintenance of fences and livestock structures, use of existing water facilities, crop production, and other activities.  What are Habitat Conservation Plans?  Private individuals, corporations, tribes, states, and local municipalities which have endangered or threatened species on their lands are prohibited from taking that listed species or harming its habitat. However, landowners may develop a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) to gain an incidental take permit, which allows certain projects or activities to continue. An HCP spells out required practices that minimize impacts to the listed species or that compensate for impacts that cannot be eliminated or minimized. The idea is to provide landowners with stability and certainty so they can make long-term investments necessary to manage lands for profit while protecting the listed species. The challenge is that developing an HCP can be complex and may take several months or years to finalize, depending on the proposed land use actions and how they affect the target species.  What are Safe Harbor Agreements?  Many landowners voluntarily create habitat that could benefit threatened or endangered species. However, property owners might hesitate to engage in conservation efforts for fear of attracting to their lands endangered species which might subsequently subject them to ESA restrictions. To minimize this disincentive, the ESA was revised to create assurances for landowners that they will not be subject to additional restrictions or conservation commitments if they engage in activities that benefit a listed species. Landowners can sign a Safe Harbor Agreement allowing a specified level of take with further assurance that habitat conservation practices can be discontinued if they become untenable. Safe Harbor agreements are similar to a CCAA in that they encourage landowners to improve habitat and encourage recovery of a species without fear that future regulatory restrictions will be imposed. However, Safe Harbor Agreements are designed for species already listed as threatened or endangered whereas CCAAs are created for candidate species.  Summary  The political, scientific, and legal aspects of the ESA make it impossible to predict all that will occur before, during, or after a species is listed. Each step in the listing process is open for citizen lawsuits, which can result in changes and refinements to policies. Negotiating the policies and practices associated with the ESA can be time consuming, costly, and mentally taxing. But there are many opportunities to promote species recovery while also continuing economic activities like ranching and farming. Before a potential listing, CCAAs and WLFW programs are important tools to consider. After a listing, individuals can engage in required public comment periods, HCPs, and Safe Harbor Agreements. Ranchers grazing livestock on public lands may also need to consult the Service about their grazing plans if a species that inhabits their grazing allotments is listed as endangered or threatened. It is important to remember that not all activities are detrimental to species recovery. There are situations where grazing and other land management activities are beneficial for species recovery. But this process can be tricky. Land managers will need to be informed and innovative to simultaneously provide for endangered species and accomplish management goals.
