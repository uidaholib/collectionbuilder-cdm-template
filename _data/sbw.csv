What is most striking about this document, though, is not the range of its information but the quality of its prose. When compared with more modern documents written by the Forest Service, The Selway Patrol is both poetic and philosophical, making at times grand statements about nature and its conservation. Please see especially the introduction and, also, the poem on the final page, A Tribute to the Forest Ranger by A. Strohecker of the U. S.
