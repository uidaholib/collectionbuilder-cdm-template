Psychiana (The Preaching Which is Bringing New Life to a Spiritually Dead World) - Lesson No. 4 - The Creation and Fall of Man,"Lesson discusses the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the moment of the Fall. Robinson uses to Fall not as humanity's decent into sin, but rather the point at which man's eyes opened to the physical world and closed to the spiritual world. This creates a 'senses veil' that does not allow people to see God as he works on earth among us.
