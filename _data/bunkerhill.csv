Operative reports, Nov . 25th, that since his last report he has  a point  made of meeting and roping in with each of the men, who have recently  lost their permits at the Standard mi ne . He has been among them  on several of the occasions when they went up to the permit office  to try to get their permits returned . In every case where these  Union men and objectionable characters havegone up to Mr . Edmunston t s  office for that purpose , when Mr . Edmunston has charged them with  being Union men , they have declared positively thatthey were not  members of that organization; then, when permits were still denied  to them , they have openly said that they were Union men and were  proud of it . This wa~ the case with Mr. Cleary, and also with  Mr . Redcliff, who, besides being a member of the Miners' Union, is  also a member of the Western Federation of Labor.  jaa . O'Donnell, who loat his permit a few days ago, is trying  very hard to get it back again, and has Dick Adams and Alward talking  in his favo~ to Edmunston. O' Donnell told operative that, if he  could get his permit again, he would work about a month and then  join the Burke Union, after which they could take his permit a.ay  any time they wished. He has been intending for some time to join  the Burke Union, but cannot join just now, for want of money to pay  the initiation fee.  Jack Cramer, who has been working at the Standard mine for t ~,e  past year, is now going on a trip east . He made application to join  the Burke Union before leaving, but was refused . Mr . Henry, the  timberman, who lost his permit through being a Union man, has now  secured a position in South America. Operative had a talk with  Henry before he left, and Henry told him that he thought Mr. Finlay  found his work rather irksome and was thinking o~ returning to  South America.  Mr . Alward is believed by the men at Burke and Mace to be an  employee of McDonald or Edmunston, and operative has often heard him  boast that he had sufficient influence with Edmunston to get back  any per.mit that he wished.  Operative states that Al Fortis s, who has lost his permit was  not to his knowledge a member of the Miner s Union. Operative met him  in Wallace, and Fortiss said that he was not a union man but that  he believed in the Union, and if he got his permit baok he intended  to join.  Operative reports that Tom Tilden was down at Wallace with some  of the boys , on the nieht of Saturday , Nov . 24th . Operative  believes that Tilden is not a member of the Miners Union, but is a  member of t he Western Federation of Labor. He is an old friend  of Nelson, at Mace, and his views about matters in this country are  much the same as Nelson ' s and decidedly op ~)osed to those of his  employers .  Jas . O' Donnell, who lost his permit l ast week, is a great friend  of Kyle, t .le shiftman at the Standard, and he told operative that he  did not think Kyle would try to get into the Union in this country,  as he thought too much of his job.

Operator reports that in company with Red. Stratton , J.P.Duston  and others , while sitting in Al. Page~s hotel on the evening of the  27th inst. they were approached by a man named Shank who asked  if they were union men and after he was told that they were he  stated that he was representing the Brown Soap Company of Dayton  Ohio and that he was selling soap~with the ynion l abels attached  to every bar , throughout the mining camps in the Couer de Alenes ���������  He said that in his interviews with merchants in the couer de Alenes  they all expressed themselves as eager to see the union men get  into power once more and have things as they were in the old times.  He further stated that business men in Wallace are very much dis������pleased  at the manner in which tne mining companies have arranged  to hire their men and say that the Couer de Alenes are being filled  up with a lot of men Who do not spend their money here but send it  out of the country ��������� He also stated that he was told by the Wardner  merchants during the day that at least thirty-five thousand dollars  had been sent out of Ward:ner during last pay day ���������  Dpring the past few days there has been con siderable wrangling  among the union men at Wardner on account of some of the members  accusing Red Stratton and Jack Simpkins of being ���������spotters��������� ��������� The  union men openly accuse them of informing Dr. France of what has  been going on at Union meetings and as a result the union meeting  came very near breaking up in a row last night. Martin D9.v is,  John Bell, Ed. Zimmerman, and Victor Price , Jim. Martin , Andy  Myers, Joe Billings, and J.P.Duston were the names of the members  present at the meeting. Nothing more than the wrangling mentioned  occured during the meeting but after the rnee ting adjourned Red.Stratton  2.  and Martin Davis to lid your operative that they were going to tell  the Miners' Union to go to Hell from row on. Red. Stratton said  that he had worked hard for the union to keep them together and  now since he had been defeated as President of the Union and  they had accused him of being a ���������spotter��������� that from now on he would  let all unions go to hell and says tha. t he will ba ve to go out of  the couer de AlenAs as he could not get any work from anywhere after  What had happened but that after this, if occasion arises, he  will stand by the mining companies from now on.  Gem. Idaho~ Jan. 27th, 1901.  Operator reports tha t in an interview with Secretary Balch of  the Mi11ers' Union , and several others, last night, Balch said that  he had received a letter from Boise and that martial law ������Kas not  likely to be declared off for sometime and that the 1Edministon  System��������� of hiring men was here to stay until it wore itself out.  The union men here seem to think that it will not take long for the  present system of employing men to play out as when a union man draws  his pay now he leaves the country as he considers he has no chance  of getting on again. A man by the name of Charles Aranda and his  partner called IMontey 1 , presumably from British Columbia, have  been making some severe talk in Gem and Wallace during the past few  days. Montey said that he knew now who had led the crowd to Wardner  and he was going to get even with kiDl one at least whom he claimed  was working at the ���������Frisco ��������� mine ��������� He said he would get him if  he had to blow the whole dam mine up.

Opr. reports: _  !hat thus far he has been unable to locate John Eliott, Mike  O'Grady and Pat Conway in Mullan, and trom What Opr. can learn������ he is ot  the opinion that they have not been in Mullan tor several days.  Opr. visited the Leslie Mine yesterday, and found that Eliott  had been working there about three weeks ago.  Opr. found a good many old time Union ~en living in cabins &long  the line of the Northern Pacitic Rail���������road between Mullan and the Montana  Divide, wh~ claims to be chopping timbers tor the Hunter, Snow Shoe, and  other Mines. ������  Opr. is infor.med that on the night ot June 26, 19011 some one  took a Shot at Deputy Graw with an Air Gun at Ktillan, the bul~et passed  through his hair on the lett aide of his he~ and went through an inch  board of a building just to the right of Deputy Graw.  In an interview with Al Putman X X of Mullan, he said that the  11 of July will soon be here and we will surely have some tun with the ������  Deputies, and we are going to get some ot the,.  In an interview with w. ;r. Walker, Editor ot the Freemans Labor  Journal, of Spokane, WaSh., he said that the Sheriff had sworn in a lot  ot tough Deputies and bad men who were going around as spies, with one  hand on their guns and the other out tor a,gratt, and at the _first provow  cation Union men were clubbed or Shot to death.  Walker said that the business men of the Coeur D' Alenes were  complaining ot hard times, and said that it was owing to the working men  keeping all of their money :for traveling expenses, as many ot them wi������shed  to leave the country as soon as they got money enoUgh to buy a ticket.  That the Miners considered the Coeur D' Alenes an unsafe place  to live in, and that the Kine Owners were paying the Deputies Five hundred  dollars tor every Union man they killed, but the Union men would surely  turn the tables soon and get some ot the Deputies out of theway.  Wallace, Idaho, June 28, 1901.  Opr . r eports:  That he met W. Perrell X (B. C.) and teorge Busy X (B. c.) and  two Dagoes X (B. c.) in town Monday, these men came here with the expecta������tion  o:f going to work until Chas. Jones������ X (W) got hold ot them and told  them his version ot the conditions here.  Perrell told Opr. that if he went t~Edmiston and he commenced  to abuse the Union he would take a shot at him.  ~errell and one o:f the Dagoes are going to Wardner looking for  work.  In an interview with John MCKinzie X (Butte) (who tor.merly  worked on Morning Mine some months ago returned there to work on the 15th  inst.) he said that there were a great many Union men working at the  Morning Mine, and many more than when he worked there before, and that it  was only a question of ttme when most o:f the men will belong to the Union.  In an interview with George Peters X X (M) he said that the  Sheriff and his Deputies thought t hat t hey were the only people in t he  country that should live and have any privileges, and that they were  probably all from ""Missouri ��������� and would have to be shownt but that there  wer~ plenty o:f men now in the Coeur D' Alenes that could and would show  them.
