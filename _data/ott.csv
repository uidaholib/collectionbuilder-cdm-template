Davids' in Moscow,"In 1896 F.A. David rented a one room building with a 15-foot frontage on the west side of Main Street south of First Street and opened a store for the Spokane Eastern Trust Comapny to sell the stocks from a bankrupt Juliaetta store. Later in 1896 David bought the remaining goods with the aid of Frank L. White and named the store 'Badger' as David was from Wisconsin, the Badger State. In 1898 the store was moved across the street to the Spicer Block where it occuped two rooms with a 25 foot frontage. In 1898 B.T. Byrne's brother-in-law Wellington Ely came to Moscow and bought an interest in the Badger store. The title 'Badger Store' was abandoned, the firm being called David & Ely. In 1899 David & Ely purchased the Dernham & Kaufmann building at the southeast corner of Third and Main streets and opened its door as a full-fledged department store in 1900. Ely died in 1908 and B.T. Byrnes became an associate of David looking after the interest of Ely. In 1913 Byrnes disposed of the Ely interests to F.A. David, and his sons were made full partners in the store. The firm's name again was changed to F.A. David & Sons. At this time the name on the building was Davids'. In 1919-1920 all four stories of the building were modernized and remodeled. F.A. David died in 1919, and shortly after the store became known as Davids' Inc. The name on the building remained Davids'. In 1946 Davids celebrated their 50th anniversary as merchants in Moscow. When the David sons reached retirement age the store was sold in 1959 to Childers, a Spokane retail merchant. In 1976 Childers sold to Fargo Wilson Wells of Pocatello who was represented by Van Engelen. Fargo Wilson Wells went bankrupt and the store was vacated April 1970. The Davids' building is now owned by two Moscow attorneys, W.E. Anderson and Len Bielenberg. The above is from Homer David's Recollections, Business Saga, from the Spokesman-Review dated May 12, 1946 and the Idahonian dated September 6, 1979.",,1976-09-06,,clippings (information artifacts),Photograph captions,Latah County;Moscow,United States--Idaho--Latah County--Moscow,46.732653,-117.001187,"Ott Historical Photograph Collection, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/ott/","University of Idaho Library Digital Initiatives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/","PG 90, Clifford M.

About half-mile down the valley from the Cameron home, running in a general east and west direction, is the famous camas grounds of the Nez Perces. Indians gathered for the annual camas harvest here every year about June 15. The camas was to the Indian what the wheat or potato crop was to the white man. To the Indian, camas was wheat and flour and bread. The camas fields in Tat-kin-mah, the place of the spotted deer, as the Indians called modern Moscow areas, was a noted camas ground. The camas plant, a species of the lily (onion) family, is found only in flood plains and mountain meadows of the Rocky Mountain region and westward. It is, therefore, entirely Western American.

"Carl Grendahl home in Latah County, Idaho","Carl Grendahl home. Latah County, Idaho  This is a scene on the lawn of the present Carl Grendahl home, formerly occupied by Thomas Crowley, a pioneer settler of Moscow. It is the old Thomas Crowley house, situated near the junction of Stevens' Trail and the Greater Nez Perce Trail, which may be seen today in a field a few roads distant. Down the gentle slopes to the eastward of the attractive Grendahl farm may be seen a section of the famous five-mile Indian race track, used by Indians since the spread of the horse northward. The Mexican or Spanish mustangs followed the Spanish bunch grass northward. These Spanish ponies weighed from 600 to 800 pounds. The bunchgrass of this region was an ideal food for horses and assisted in building up a pony noted for his stamina and endurance. The finding of tools and weapons of Indians at this place established the fact that this vicinity was in frequent use as a camping ground. Further discoveries may tell a story of aboriginal trade. The meeting places, when once established, served as trading centers; and lost articles often can be traced to their place of origin. The various names of a given piece of merchandise by different language groups established a 'time perspective', as the scientists call it, in aboriginal culture. The culture loan words help to establish the extent in time of their trade relations. From this attractive residence, near the windmill, a few feet to the right of this picture, can be seen the old spring used by Father Cataldo and countless other horseback travellers over the trail. In his letters, Father Cataldo speaks of the hospitality of Mr. Thomas Crowley, whose guest he frequently was. Recently, a granite pestle used by the Indians in grinding their camas food was found near the scene of this picture, and also a large flint arrowhead and other Indian tools. No. 3- On map.

Looking east at Second Street from Main Street in Moscow in the early 1900's,"Part of the Browne Block shows at the northeast corner of Second and Main streets. History of the building follows. [90-2-0054]  Preserving Moscow's Past. The Latah County Abstract and Title Guarantee Company began business in 1888. It was part of the Browne Building erected during the 1880s. The company was established by I.C. Hattabaugh, Nez Perce County recorder, who held the office until Latah County was divided from Nez Perce in 1888. The Moscow National Bank occupied the front part of the building until it closed down in 1896. In 1890 Hattabaugh sold his interest in the company to a Mr. Veatch and a Mr. Woodworth, who in turn sold out to a Mr. S.R.H. McGowan in 1894. C.L. Thompson, who operated the Idaho Realty and Trust Company on the site of what is now the Nobby Inn, merged with Mr. Woodworth in 1911, and the company was renamed Latah County Trust Company. Thompson built the company vault, which is one of the largest private vaults in Idaho, according to his grandson, Tod Kiblen, who now runs the company. The vault houses every property transaction in Latah county and dates back to the government patents in the 1870s. The outside of the building is being restored by Hamilton Enterprises of Coeur d'Alene. The second story windows have been replaced, paint over the original bricks has been cleaned away and the mortar in between the bricks replaced. The pictures show the building as it appeared in 1896, and a recent photo of the fireplace, which is built of oak and has been carefully looked after and preserved.

Idaho Brewery located at the southeast corner of C and Main streets. Built in 1892 by Niederstadt, Schober and Koehler and went into bankruptcy in 1894. In 1896 the brewing equipment was sold to parties at Trail Creek. In 1904 the building was used as a fruit vacuum, dryer and storage plant. Later was the Fred Veatch vinegar plant until the 1920s. Val Ruckman processed and sold feed until about the 1940s. W.H. Craig & Son operated the Idaho Transfer Company at this location for their moving and storage business until it burned in November 1956. Old flat storage section still stands west of the alley. Everett Wills Tractor Company now owns the property. Moscow Brewery operated at the northeast corner of  A and Main streets. Built in 1882 by Otto Fries and Joe Niederstadt. In 1886 Joe Niederstadt was the sole owner, and in 1890 Mr. Schober became a partner. From 1892 to 1895 the brewery was not in operation and was sold to F.L. Koehler in 1895. In 1902 Herman Nichola was operating the brewery. Fred Francl purchased the brewery in 1903 and it burned July 29, 1908.

North block on West Third Street,"Make Way for Bank Change -- The north side of the 100 block on West Third street, shown in the photo above, will undergo a face lifting in the next six months to provide modern facilities for First Security Bank of Moscow, located at the corner of Third and Main. Manager F.K. Dammarell said today that the present Western Store building, acquired by the bank early in January from Milburn Kenworthy, will be utilized as temporary quarters for the bank while extensive remodeling is being done in the present bank building. At the same time the Husky Service Station will be razed and construction started on a drive-in bank unit to be located at the corner of Third and Jackson. Upon completion of the main building's remodeling, the Western Store building will be razed and that area utilized for customer parking and access for the drive-in unit. Work on the latter unit is expected to begin as soon as possible, Dammarell said. The remodeling of the main bank will begin about Aug. 1.

"George M. Tomer stands under a tree his father planted in Latah County, Idaho","Mr. George M. Tomer stands under the tree, the only surviving son of Mr. George W. Tomer, one of Moscow's earliest pioneers. Mr. Tomer was born in Nevada City, California, where his father, a California forty-niner, had mined placer gold for twenty-one years. Hearing through his maternal grandmother, Mr. and Mrs. Mathew Montgomery, who came to Moscow in 1870, of the rich and beautiful country in Nez Perce County, Idaho Territory, his parents decided to establish a squatter's claim here. Mr. Tomer's parents and his little family of four children left San Francisco in the early spring of 1871, and came by a leaky ocean boat to Portland. This craft, so Mr. Tomer relates, sank about a year later. [C.J. Brosnan may have written this text.] From Portland, they came by boat up the Columbia River to Lewiston. During their brief stay the family stopped at the famous old hostelry known as the DeFrance Hotel. While in Lewiston, Mr. Tomer's father, a tree lover, purchased the little sapling which has grown into the huge tree near with Mr. Tomer stands. Mr. Tomer states that he did not come to Moscow in a covered wagon, but in a plain lumber wagon. His grandfather and grandmother, Mr. and Mrs. Mathew Montgomery, according to Mr. Tomer, died shortly after his family reached Moscow. Her grave stone, inscribed with an appropriate inscription, reads that her death occurred in 1873. Mrs. Montgomery was the first white person buried in the old Moscow cemetery. This grave-stone stands within a half-mile of the old Nez Perces Trail. The Tomers were not able, at first, to file a hundred and sixty acres land claim under the provisions of the Homestead Act of 1862, because their arrival antedated the land surveys in this region. The land office was not opened in Lewiston until the year of 1875. The Tomer squatter's claim is situated near the feet of Tomer's Butte, an exceedingly ancient granite butte. This butte was one a tall mountain before the floor of the valley, now occupied by the city of Moscow, was filled by lava flows and deposits of wind-blown soil from what is now the State of Washington.

"Silver poplar tree planted by George M. Tomer May 6, 1871","This is the venerable silver poplar tree planted on May 6, 1871, by Mr. George W. Tomer, who established a squatter's claim earlier in that year near the foot of Tomer's Butte, to which he gave his name. This oldest planted tree in Moscow has withstood the elements for nearly three-quarters of a century and is today the Nestor of Moscow's trees. This species, Populus albus, appears to be one of the earliest of foreign ornamental trees to be distributed in this region. It is a native of Eurasia. The bark is much corrugated, and this dark bark of the bole contrasts with the whitish bark of the branches. This contrast lends picturesqueness to the tree. This is now a monument, and should be protected. [C.J. Brosnan may have written this text.] No. 5- On map. See No. 6- for location.                                     This is a photograph showing the complete tree. Note large trunk,  corrugated bark, and  spreading branches, and two younger trees that arose from suckers from the parent tree. The roots of this fine tree extend 200 feet from the trunk. This will give the spectator some idea of why it has withstood the storms and droughts of some three-quarters of a century. If present conditions relating to water supply are maintained, this tree can still be regarded as youthful. This means that this sturdy tree has not as yet passed more than a third of its expectant life. [C.J.

Early Genesee,"Genesee, Latah County, Idaho Territory in the year 1888. Genesee is a garden spot. It is one of the best towns in the Palouse country. It is the largest town on the Spokane and Pacific Railroad. It has six merchandise stores, four hotels, two livery stables, three blacksmith shops, two barber shops, one drug store, two furniture stores, two hardware stores, one tin shop, one millinery, two real estate offices, one butcher shop,  one newspaper, three grain warehouses, two breweries, and fine schools, churches, good store buildings and many fine residences.                The print [90-4-001?] was given to the News by Mr. Henry Lorang and taken by his uncle, Mr. Thomas Lorang, who in 1890 was a traveling photographer. Main Street is slightly to the left of center in the picture, and shows the old Rosenstein Store and across the street is the old livery stable. The small dark building to the left of the darker building is the depot and the larger building is the old warehouse and grain storage place. The large two story white house on the right belonged to Matt Kambitch, who was in partnership with a man named Gieger who operated the brewery.

Kendrick [03],"The town was founded by Thomas Kirby, the first postmaster, in 1889, who named it Latah.

The town was then named Kendrick, in honor of the chief engineer of the Northern Pacific. May 8, the town was platted, and Oct. 15, 1890, the same year it was incorporated. The first train arrived Feb. 4, 1891. Aug. 16 1893 came the first big fire wiping out 31 business structures and caused a loss of about $100,000. Again Aug. 4, 1904 fire destroyed 43 business structures and 19 private homes. Not one business structure was left standing.
