Some limnological aspects of Spring Valley Reservoir,"Duff, Douglas Willard",1965-05,,"46.78, -116.76",limnology; reservoirs,"The present investigation is an attempt to contribute to our inadequate knowledge of limnological interrelationships in an artificial body of water. Spring  Valley Reservoir, a 56 acre artificial lake, was selected for study. Field work extended from May through November,  1964, but certain phases of the laboratory work were not completed until March, 1965.  Particular attention has been given to vertical and seasonal variations of zooplankton populations in reference to selected environmental factors such as temperature,  transparency, dissolved oxygen, free carbon dioxide, total and calcium hardness, alkalinity, nitrogen, and phosphorous. In addition, emphasis has been given to  the mean summer standing crop of zooplankton.  Although limnology has been recognized as a distinct branch of science for less than 70 years (Welch, 1952),  much has been done to provide an understanding of lake productivity and the numerous factors influencing productivity . Many investigations have been conducted in an  attempt to determine characteristics with which to classify the productivity of lakes. As a result, many physical,  chemical, and biological measures of productivity have evolved and are now used with varying degrees of success.  Some of these limnological methods have been included in the present investigation.",Palouse Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196501,iwdl-196501,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2007-12-08,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",Jodi Haire,,37
"Relationship of farm size to ability to pay for irrigation water in the dry lake area of Canyon County, Idaho","Coffing, Arthur Lee",1965-05,Boise River,"43.71, -116.76",irrigation; Idaho; Canyon County,"The main objective of the study is to determine the ability of different sizes of farms to pay for irrigation water. This ability will be measured by the capability of the farm to produce high value crops at low costs.  Phrased in a different way, the objective of this study is to find the maximum that farms of various sizes can pay for irrigation water if, at the same time, all other factors of production are adequately rewarded. This, to some degree, will indicate the maximum value of water if irrigation is its highest use. This type of information can be of use to future studies which involve water rights or water values.  A secondary objective is to determine the economies of size of the various enterprises.

A solid-liquid phase precipitation metering device,"Read, John Carlton",1966-06,,,precipitation,"A need for a precipitation metering device capable of discriminating between solid and liquid phases of precipitation initiated this research project.  A literature search revealed no existing instrument capable of performing this function; however, references were found to certain schemes which, with modifications, could possibly be adapted as a solution to this problem.  An optical scheme was selected for further research because this type of system requires no mechanical motion, thus avoiding icing problems likely to be encountered in the operational environment, and because luminous radiation and electricity are energy forms which are easily transducible from one form to the other.  A photosensitive device was used to determine the relative light attenuant and reflective effects of the precipitation particle types.  With certain geometric restrictions it was found that the reflective properties of snow are of a sufficient degree of magnitude greater than those of rain to enable the development of a system sensitive to the presence of snow and not rain. Optical attenuant characteristics of the snow and rain particles were found to be similar in degree of magnitude of photosensitive device response.  A prototype system employing both reflective and attenuant effects of the particles was developed and shown to be capable of detection and identification of both precipitation phases.  This system is recommended as a solution to this problem.",,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196603,iwdl-196603,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2008-04-24,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",Jodi Haire,,39

"The economic value of water in different uses within agriculture. Research technical completion report, project A-017-IDA","Maher, Matthew Joseph",1967-08,,,water use; irrigation water,"This study was undertaken in order to determine the economic value of water in alternative uses within agriculture in Idaho. It is important to Idaho farmers and to the economy of Idaho in general to have such estimates available so that maximum economic gains may be derived from the available supply of irrigation water.  Three irrigation areas, Area I, Area II, and Area III, along the Snake River valley were studied. Costs of producing different crops in those areas were already available from previous studies. The author interviewed selected farmers in two of those areas to update available information and to determine the resource supply situations confronting operators.  The analytical tool applied to fulfill the objectives was linear programming. Three representative farms of different sizes were constructed for Area I and one each for Areas II and III. Three analytical models were formulated as steps in attaining the objectives. Changes were made from model to model in order to make the analysis more realistic or to investigate some particular facet of the problem.   The results of the study indicate that the value of water varies from area to area, water being most valuable in Area I and least valuable in Area III. Analysis of different sized farms in Area I indicates that farmers can afford to pay more for water on large farms than on smaller farms.

New development: the Geiger-Muller radioisotope snow gage,"Waldron III, Harvey Macy",1967-05,,,radioactive snow gages,"Since about 1947, the use of radioactive isotopes has been known to be adaptable to the measurement of water contained in snow packs. Early investigations of these measurement techniques were unsuccessful because the Geiger-Muller detector, the detector readily available at that time, is a device incapable of energy discrimination.  Energy discrimination is achievable by the use of scintillation detectors resulting in the present use of these devices as radiation snow gages. However, the scintillation systems have the disadvantages of high cost and complex maintenance as compared to Geiger-Muller systems.  Mechanical energy discrimination, using collimation techniques, makes possible use of the non-energy discriminant Geiger-Muller systems for snow gaging. This paper discusses such a system that has been developed and tested. Design emphasis is placed on energy discrimination and electronic dead-time correction methods. Laboratory and field test data are presented to show predictable performance characteristics. All evidence to date indicates that the Geiger-Muller snow gage may be preferable, considering the combined aspects of accuracy and costs, to either the scintillation snow gage or the pressure pillow.

Field studies of existing seepage measurement techniques including ponding tests, inflow-outflow techniques and seepage meters were made. A new seepage meter which will operate efficiently in large operating canals was developed. An accurate and reliable tensiometer system for monitoring changes in soil moisture pressure beneath operating canals was developed. Measured decreases in soil moisture and pressure beneath an operating canal during the irrigation season indicated decreasing seepage rates caused by natural sealing of a thin soil layer on the canal bottom. A fast response, inexpensive null point tensiometer was laboratory tested and a device for measuring the capillary pressure - saturation curve for soils in situ was investigated.

Most distinctive microclimatic feature is the extreme development of nocturnal temperature inversions during summer and early autumn. Mean inversions between non-contiguous hilltops and bottomlands may reach 20 to 30 degrees. Greatest recorded on a specific day has been 42 degrees. Mean temperatures, length of frost-free season, nocturnal relative humidities, natural vegetation, and land use are all strongly influenced by these inversions. None of the six official Weather Bureau stations in the vicinity of the profile is located to show these inversions. Diurnal temperature and relative humidity patterns differ greatly at individual sites along the profile and are analyzed and compared.

A definite area known commonly as the Oakley Fan was selected as the site for analysis.   The author interviewed many of the farmers in the area in order to collect physical input and output information. This information was gathered for the years 1965, 66, & 67.   The analytical tools applied to fulfill the objectives were a synthetic budget approach in conjunction with a linear programming model. Such analysis depicted the structure of three sizes of typical farms in the area in contrast to three theoretical optimum farms.   The results of this study indicate that the farmers in the area are now relatively close to the theoretical optimum structure. Also, economies of size were found to the extent that the smaller farmers received approximately 50% less than the larger farmers for their return to management and water.

Studies on methods of soil moisture determination,"Hite, Howard Eugene",1968-04,,,soil water,"Though the need for instrumentation capable of determining soil moisture quickly and accurately has long been recognized, no dependable means suitable for automatic and remote soil moisture measurement has yet been developed. Presently, the only reliable method for measuring soil moisture is a time consuming process which requires human attention. Water is removed from a soil sample by heating, and the resultant weight loss is determined. Considerable work has been reported on a device which measures the electrical conductivity of a gypsum block imbedded in the soil. Water causes the electrical resistance of the block to decrease. These blocks are alleged to be unreliable under many field conditions. The work reported in this thesis was undertaken with the intent to develop a more reliable instrument for remote site operation. An extensive survey of the literature led to the selection of three fields of study: streaming potential, thermal conductivity and specific heat, and absorption of infrared radiation by moist soil.  Experimentation revealed that the factors controlling streaming potential were so diverse that isolation of soil moisture or moisture flow variables was not feasible in field applications.  An original thermal measuring device could be successfully and reliably used in certain ambient temperature ranges.  Certain wavelengths in the infrared spectrum are readily absorbed by moisture in the soil.

Horizontal dispersion and density of limnetic crustaceans in four sub-alpine lakes,"Wissmar, Robert Charles",1968-05,,"46.85, -115.49",Crustaceans,"Limnetic crustaceans from four subalpine lakes in northeast Idaho were studied during the summers of 1966 and 1967. Four methods were used to take quantitative vertical plankton samples. These collections were used for comparison of lakes, comparison of sampling methods within lakes, and comparison of sample sizes.   The four lakes were similar in having a simple species composition and low density of limnetic crustaceans. For all samples Fisher's coefficient of dispersion S2/X-bar was computed and used as a measure of horizontal dispersion. Mean total crustacean density and dispersion appeared to approximate taxa density and dispersions. Data for all comparisons were based on the density and horizontal dispersion of mean total crustaceans.   The meadow lakes had higher densities of limnetic crustaceans than the headwall lakes, 1966 and 1967. There was an indication that a positive linear relationship existed between total crustacean density and coefficient of dispersion when sampled by different methods in each of the four lakes.

Relationship between farm size and ability to pay for irrigation water. Idaho agricultural research progress report no. 112,"Coffing, Arthur; Lindeborg, Karl H.",1966,Snake River,"43.46, -116.6",farms; water supply; irrigation,"This study was conducted in the Dry Lake area at Nampa, Idaho, where 5 or 6 companies are pumping irrigation water from the Snake River to a plateau 500 to 600 feet above the river surface. Irrigation development costs of bringing the water to the headgates of the farms are not included in this phase of the study.   Data was secured for 8 farms by interviewing each farm operator and land owner. To make comparisons between farms and also between enterprises, the data were broken down into per acre variable costs, fixed costs, total returns, net income and the cost of producing a dollar's worth of output. The term &quot;cost per dollar of output&quot; is the ratio of costs to returns. This ratio makes it possible to compare high-valued crops with low-valued crops on a per acre basis. This is a very sensitive measurement. For ex-ample, one cent change in the ratio for potato enterprise means a change in net income of $3.25 per acre.   The budgeting method of estimating water values in irrigation was used in this study. Long-run planning cost curves were estimated from the budgets by using simple curve linear regression. From the regression equations for each of the four enterprises (grain, sugar beets, potatoes and alfalfa seed), 12 model farms were constructed.   The long-run average total cost curve for the model farms, which incorporates a long-run rotation and long-run price and yield expectations, indicated economies of size up to a farm size of 2,400 acres.   Net income--the measurement of how much money is left over to pay for irrigation water after all expenses, including remuneration for management, land and investment, have been paid--varied from about $50 to $57 per acre for all model farms.",Boise Basin,Idaho agricultural research progress report,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,"Agricultural Experiment Station, University of Idaho, College of Agriculture",University of Idaho,eng,196602,iwdl-196602,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2008-01-17,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.08 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF; 1,785,426 bytes",jh,,60
"Geology and hydrogeology of the Albion Basin, Cassia County, Idaho","Myers, David Arthur",1967-05,Snake River,"42.41, -113.57",geology; geohydrology; Cassia County,"Albion basin is an alluvium-filled basin in eastern Cassia County, Idaho, about 18 miles southeast of Burley.   The study area is in the Basin and Range province of the western United States. The eastern boundary of the basin is formed by the Malta Range, a rotated fault block which apparently is bounded by high-angle normal faults on the east and west. A line of hot springs marks the probable position of the fault on the west side of the Malta Range. East Hills bounds the basin on the north and the main mass of Albion Range forms the south and west boundaries.  The Malta Range and part of the East Hills are made up of a thick flow of quartz latite. The flow consists of three zones: lower and upper vitrophyre zones, and a central lithoidal zone. No mineralogical differences and no physical breaks were noted between the zones. Capping the Malta Ridge in the north is a body of Snake River basalt about one square mile in area. The Albion Rage is underlain by metamorphic rocks.   Marsh Creek is the principal stream in the basin, but the ground water is the main source of irrigation and domestic water. Wells range in depth from 11 feet to more than 700 feet and yields range from a few gallons per minute to 540 gallons per minute. Wells must be cased the entire depth of penetration. Several clay lenses in the alluvium create local artesian aquifers. The water, mostly of the calcium-bicarbonate type, is suitable for domestic and irrigation use:  the total dissolved solids content ranges from 202 ppm. to 2294 ppm; temperatures of the waters in the deep wells are generally 62 degrees to 74 degrees Fahrenheit, and in the shallow wells, 57 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot springs in Marsh Canyon are used only for irrigation, although the possibility exists that they could be developed for domestic heating or for recreation.  Quantitative data on water resources could not be obtained from the present study, but available data suggest that the basin is not yet fully developed.",Boise Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196704,iwdl-196704,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2008-09-18,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF; 2,880,954 bytes",Jodi Haire,,61

Proceedings of the 6th annual Enginieering Geology & Soils Engineering Symposium","Jones, Robert W.; Ross, Sylvia H.; Williams, Roy E.",1968-04-18,,,recharge basins; intermittent streams; artificial recharge; Latah County,"The City of Moscow and the University of Idaho are the principal users of ground water in Moscow basin. Water is obtained from artesian aquifers in the basalt flows and interbedded sediments of the Columbia River Group.  From 1896 to the 1960s, all water was obtained from an artesian aquifer that is at a depth of about 250 feet. Water levels in the wells declined steadily over the years; the total decline at the city's pumping plant was about 100 feet by the 1960s.  The water in the aquifer is of poor quality because of high concentrations of iron.  Exploration for other ground water supplied led to the discovery of good quality water in productive aquifers at depths of 700 feet and 1300 feet.  The City and University shifted nearly all pumping to the deeper aquifers, and since heavy pumping ceased in the upper aquifer, water levels have been steadily rising.  Properties of the deeper aquifers are not yet known and the amount of water that they will yield over long periods of time is uncertain.  Strong possibility exists that the deeper aquifers will show a long-term decline of water levels, indicating depletion of the supply of ground water.  It is uncertain that projected future demands can be met by naturally-available ground water.  Import of surface water from outside the basin is costly due to distance, construction cost of pipeline, operation cost of high pumping lift.  Preliminary study indicates that artificial recharge of ground water by utilizing seasonal runoff from intermittent streams in and near Moscow basin is a feasible and cheaper alternative to long-distance importation of surface water.

The first approach was to estimate the economic value of water through cost function analysis. The value of water in this approach is a proportion of the cost of producing a dollar value of output. This approach does not yield the value of an incremental acre foot of water, but yields a weighted average of all the increments of water over the whole range of production.  The other approach of economic analysis was the application of linear programming in estimating the value of an incremental unit of water. Three irrigation areas along the Snake River were included in the study. Costs of producing different crops were computed and representative farms of the three areas were constructed. These farm operations were assumed to be typical of the areas, and under given resource allocation restrictions, the economic return to the input of water would indicate the value of an incremental unit of water in the production of agricultural products.",,,,"Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Coffing, A.

A survey of the literature led to the selection of four fields of study: streaming potential, thermal conductivity and specific heat, absorption of infrared radiation by moist soil, and some adaption of the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance.   Experimentation revealed that the factors controlling streaming potential were so diverse that isolation of soil moisture or moisture flow variables was not feasible in field applications. Extensive laboratory testing of an original thermal measuring device showed that this principle could be successfully and reliably used in certain ambient temperature ranges. The data also revealed that, when soil is partially frozen at 32 degrees F, information could be derived on the percentage of the soil water in the frozen state, provided the soil moisture content was known. Certain wavelengths in the infrared spectrum are readily absorbed by moisture in the soil. A prototype instrument which utilizes this phenomenon was fabricated. Certain problems in packaging the unit were encountered, but preliminary experimentation assured that this measuring technique shows promise and could be further developed.

Simulation of ground water flow in the lower Boise River Basin,"Petrich, Christian R.",2004-02,Boise River,"43.65, -116.44",groundwater flow; Boise River Watershed; Ada County; Canyon County; computer simulation,"The lower Boise River basin (Treasure Valley) aquifer system consists of a series of shallow,  relatively high-permeability aquifers and a deeper, regional flow system. A numerical model of regional ground water flow was developed to evaluate (1) the effects of large-scale increases in ground water withdrawals on regional ground water levels and (2) the potential effects of altered recharge rates (associated with conversion of agricultural to urban land use) on regional ground water levels.  The model was constructed using the three-dimensional, finite difference MODFLOW code (Harbaugh et al., 2000; McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988; McDonald and Harbaugh, 1996).  The model was calibrated under steady-state hydraulic conditions using the automated parameter estimation code PEST (Doherty, 1998; Doherty, 2000). Horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity parameters were calibrated to 200 averaged water level observations  and 6 actual and estimated vertical head differences.  The model calibrated with higher hydraulic conductivity values in the uppermost aquifer zones, corresponding with known areas of coarser-grained sediments. PEST-calibrated parameter values also indicated relatively high hydraulic conductivity values in areas of the  eastern and central portion of the valley associated with fluvial/deltaic deposition. Simulated fluxes between model layers in the base calibration indicated a relatively small amount of water moves vertically between model layers, especially in the lower layers. Based on simulation results, most recharge that occurred in shallow aquifer zones did not reach deeper  zones.  A 10% increase or decrease in recharge led to minimal changes in water levels or parameter  value estimates because shallow ground water levels in central portions of the basin are controlled, in part, by elevations of surface water channels. Decreased or increased recharge resulted in changes in the rates of water discharging to model drain, general head boundary (Lake Lowell), constant head (Snake River), and river (Boise River) cells. Changes in land  use that lead to decreases in shallow-aquifer recharge may not have a substantial effect on shallow ground water levels until the water table elevations remain below those of nearby  surface channels.  Simulations indicated that some ground water level declines might occur with a 20% increase in ground water withdrawals over 1996 levels. Modest simulated declines were observed in the Boise area in layers 1 and 2. Greater simulated declines were observed in the central portion of the valley (especially in the Lake Lowell area) in layers 3 and 4. The simulated  20% increase in ground water withdrawals resulted in increased losses from the Boise River (23%), decreased discharge to agricultural drains (62%), and decreased discharge to the Snake River (9%). Simulated water level declines andlor changes in mass balance  components reflected a combination of parameter uncertainty and response to a changed hydraulic stress.",Boise Basin,Research Report,,"IWRRI; Idaho Department of Water Resources; Urban, Scott; Doherty, John",Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200402,iwdl-200402,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2011-03-03,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF; 18,471,856 bytes",Jodi Haire,,79
Simulation of increased ground water withdrawals in the lower Boise River basin,"Petrich, Christian R.",2004-02,Boise River,"43.65, -116.44",groundwater flow; Boise River watershed; computer simulation; Ada County; Canyon County,"Currently there are over 450 unprocessed applications for new water rights in the lower Boise  River basin, an area of southwestern Idaho that is home to approximately 35% of Idaho's  population. The additional water is being requested for irrigation, municipal, commercial,  and aesthetic uses. The water requested for non-supplemental purposes could represent  approximately a 20% increase over 1996 levels of ground water withdrawals. The potential  impact of processing these new well applications on regional ground water levels was  evaluated using the Treasure Valley ground water flow model (Petrich, 2004a).  The Treasure Valley ground water flow model was constructed with the USGS MODFLOW  code (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1996) and calibrated to steady-state hydraulic conditions  using the PEST parameter estimation code (Doherty, 2000). The calibration was based on  over 200 water level and 6 vertical head difference observations. Predictive analysis  (Doherty, 2000) was used to estimate worst (and best) potential outcomes given parameter  non-uniqueness in the calibrated model.  The simulation results indicated that aquifer level declines might occur if all of these  currently unprocessed, non-supplemental, ground water rights were granted. Water level  declines could be in the range of 10 feet to over 40 feet, depending on valley location, actual  amount of withdrawals, and depth of extraction. Local areas of simulated declines were  noted south of Lake Lowell in an area in the northwestern portion of the model and in  portions of an area between Boise, Meridian, and Kuna. These may be associated with  unrealistically high simulated stresses or excessively low simulated aquifer parameter values.  The simulated declines also may indicate potential problems in supplying the increasing  ground water demands in these areas.  The least declines were predicted in the uppermost model layer, which corresponds roughly  with the uppermost 200 feet of aquifer. Most of the estimated new simulated withdrawals in  the uppermost layer resulted in decreased discharge to drains.  The simulated declines presented in this report are the result of both calibration effects and  increased withdrawals. Additional comparisons between minimum base calibration heads  and prediction heads should be conducted to refine these predicted declines.",Boise Basin,Research Report,,"IWRRI; Idaho Department of Water Resources; Urban, Scott; Doherty, John",Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200403,iwdl-200403,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2004-03-09,"Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word, Acrobat 5.0.5 Distiller (Windows),Archival Master file is a TIFF; 4,421,050 bytes",Jodi Haire,,80

The University of Idaho Water Resources Research  Institute in turn entered into subcontracts with the water resources research  institutes of Oregon, Washington and Montana to do portions of the study involving  their respective states.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the theoretical potential for  small hydroelectric development of the Pacific Northwest Region.  The study area included all of the Columbia River system in the United   States and all other river basins in Idaho, Oregon and Washington. The   total area studied is approximately 292,000 squares miles.  The first phase of the study was to evaluate the theoretical power potential   of the streams in the region. This portion of the study was completed   in March 1979.   This report is the completion report for Phase II of the study where an  evaluation of the hydro potential was made for existing dams without present   generating capabilities, proposed hydro sites, and at proposed power sites in   existing irrigation systems.  For this phase of the study small hydro was defined as a site with potential  to produce power between 200 kW and 25MW with flows at the 50%   exceedance level. This is slightly different than the Phase I definition   of low head hydro which called for power at the 50% exceedance to be greater   than 200 KW and heads to be between 3 and 20 meters. The change in definition  of Small Hydro sites was requested by the Department of Energy.   The existing dams that were studied were those that were identified in   state dam registration lists or in the Corps of Engineers Dam Safety Studies. The primary sources of information for the proposed sites were siting studies   done by various federal and state agencies. No searches were made for new   sites that had not been previously identified.   Another aspect to this study involved evaluating transmission and load   restraints at existing dams that do not have generating capabilities.

"Distribution and mobilization of arsenic and antimony species in the Coeur d'Alene River system. Research technical completion report, 14-08-0001-G1222-07","Wai, C. M.; Mok, W. M.",1989-05,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.51, -116.15",mining wastes; water pollution; arsenic; speciation; sediment; antimony;,"The mining industry along the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River in northern Idaho is a major producer of silver, lead, and zinc in the United States. Mining operations in the past have discharged huge amounts of mining wastes into the South Fork of the river causing a serious pollution problem for the Coeur d'Alene River system. Sediments in the South Fork and the Main Stem of the river are contaminated with arsenic(As), antimony(Sb), cadmium(Cd), Lead(Pb), Zinc(Zn), and other metals. The North Fork water was found relatively uncontaminated and showed very low concentrations of As ( &lt;0.26 ng/mL) and Sb ( &lt;0.17 ng/mL). Water samples collected from the South Fork showed high levels of As (0.16-1.64 ng/mL) and Sb (1.11-8.25 ng/mL). Relatively lower concentrations of As (0.11-1.48 ng/mL) and Sb (0.23-1.90 ng/mL) were found in the main stem of the river. Arsenic(lll) was the predominant form of As in the South Fork and main stem, whereas the North Fork generally had a higher As(V) concentration in water. Antimony(V) was the major Sb species in the three branches of the river. Leaching of As and Sb from the sediments along the main stem depends on the pH of the water and on the iron and manganese content of the sediments. The amount of As and Sb leached was high in acidic or in basic solutions. The enhanced desorption of As and Sb in basic solutions was probably related to the anionic properties of these elements. An accumulation of As and Sb on the surface sediments was also observed in the delta area where the river enters Lake Coeur d'Alene. The releases of As and Sb from the sediments appear to associate with the free iron oxides and manganese oxides in the sediments. The leaching characteristics of Sb are similar to those of As. However, releases of sediment Sb were generally found linear with respect to time while asymptotic limits on As releases were reached. Significant amounts of Zn, Fe, and Mn were also released during leaching, but Cu, Cd, Ph, and Ni were much less leachable. According to this study, interaction of water with the existing sediments is likely to be a major factor controlling the water quality of the Coeur d'Alene River.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198906,iwdl-cda_wai_1989,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,89
"Integrated study on the impact of metallic trace element pollution in the Coeur d'Alene-Spokane Rivers-Lake drainage system. Project completion report, OWR (Title II project C-4145)","Funk, William H.; Rabe, Fred W.; Filby, Royston; Bailey, Gary; Bennet, Paul; Shah, Kishor; Sheppard, John C.; Savage, Nancy; Bauer, Stephen B.; Bourge, Alain; Bannon, Gerald; Edwards, George; Anderson, Dale; Syms, Pat; Rothert, Jane; Seamster, Alan",1975-08,Spokane River; Lake Coeur d'Alene,"47.69, -116.81",water quality; trace metals; food chains; neutron activation analysis; heavy metals; sediment concentration; benthos;,"Comprehensive limnological, water quality, productivity and substrata investigations have been made of the Coeur d'Alene drainage, Coeur d'Alene Lake and the Spokane River. These investigations were made in an attempt to answer questions as to the passage of metallic elements through the aquatic food chain in the study area as well as to determine the critical factors involved in the poor recovery of the South Fork and main stem of the Coeur d'Alene River. Additional work was carried out to determine the water quality of these areas and the Spokane River. Extensive studies were also made upon the substrata and limiting factors for macroinvertebrates of the Upper Spokane River. Artificial substrates (baskets) placed in the unpolluted portions of the Coeur d'Alene River developed abundant and diverse macroinvertebrate fauna comparable to that collected from natural substrata by Surber Sampler. Flooding of Coeur d'Alene River during the spring highwater period transports heavy metals, especially Zn, into the lateral lakes bordering the river. Zinc concentrations in the lake water were highest near the lake inlets. Metal concentrations in fishes from the lakes were higher than those tested from a control lake in the St. Joe drainage. There appeared to be greater Zn concentrations in the muscle tissues of omnivorous fish such as the bullhead than in the same tissue of piscivorous fish such as the large mouth bass. The fishes seem to be exerting some homeostatic control over the metal level in their tissues. The overall water quality of Coeur d'Alene Lake appeared to be relatively the same as the found in our earlier study (Funk, Rabe, and Filby et al., 1973) based upon routine water sampling during coring operations and on data gathered from a water quality station maintained at the lake outlet. Nineteen sediment cores were obtained along the lengthwise axis of the lake and from selected bays. A layer of heavy metals 80-30 cm in thickness occurred in the Coeur d'Alene delta region and lake proper. This layer decreased in thickness as one traversed the lake from off the delta region toward the outlet where the layer is reduced to 5 cm. Coring operations from the delta region of the lake toward the southern end revealed the same phenomenon occurred to a lesser extent to a point between the area of Conkling Park and Chatcolet Lake. This layer of heavy metals could constitute a hazard to aquatic life if Coeur d'Alene Lake eutrophies to the point of anaerobic conditions in the hypolimnion. The biological productivity of the Spokane River is largely controlled by the water quality of Coeur d'Alene Lake as well as by the substrate, temperature and flow of the river. Nutrient additions to the river as it flows toward the city of Spokane increases the productivity of the lower four stations, especially at the Plantes Ferry station. Heavy metals, such as Zn, Cu, and Pb, appear to be concentrated to relatively high amounts in algae, aquatic macrophytes and other vegetation growing along the river. Algae and detritus-consuming macroinvertebrates such as mayfiles and stoneflies pass these metals along to the fishes, expecially trout because of the trout's predilection for these organisms. However, there appears to be a reduction of concentration of metals in tissues at each trophic level as one moves up the food chain. The organisms appear to be actively excreting the metals. In the fishes, the filter bodies such as the kidneys and liver concentrated the metals several-fold over that of other tissues and therefore tend to confirm this assumption. Nonetheless, the level of Zn, for example, in the muscle tissue of Spokane River fishes may be two to three times that in muscle tissue of the same species taken from undisturbed streams high in Coeur d'Alene drainage. For these reasons it has been concluded by the investigators that additional efforts should be made to curtail and control seepage from tailings ponds as well as reduction and eventual control of wastes and nutrient runoff in the Coeur d'Alene and Spokane river drainage basins. The area encompassed by this study includes extremely valuable recreation, wildlife, and fisheries recources as well as sources of food and water for human consumption.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197512,iwdl-cda_funk_1975,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,90
"Blue-green algae toxicity in Black Lake, Kootenai County, Idaho. Research technical completion report","Kann, Jacob; Falter, Michael C.;",1985-09,Black Lake; Coeur d'Alene River,"47.45, -116.66",cyanophyta; phytoplankton; toxicity;,"Increasing occurrences of explosive growths or blooms of blue-green alqae in lakes throughout the western United States have been linked to recreational use, sewage inputs, and non-point runoff associated with agriculture and grazing. In certain instances these blooms produce a toxin which can be lethal to fish, aquatic invertebrates, mammals and humans. Black Lake in northern Idaho has experienced massive late summer and fall growths of a toxic algae, Nostoc commune. At times, demonstrated fatal toxicity to cattle and small mammals has resulted in three of the last four years. Since little is known of the exact environmental conditions required to cause toxicity, environmental and phytoplankton parameters were monitored throughout the lake durinq summer and fall, 1984. Although conditions seemed favorable, and other blooms were intermittent through the summer-fall 1984, Nostoc did not develop to bloom proportions and toxicity did not occur. Algal assay results showed that algal growth potential ranged in the very productive range of -1 9.60 to 12.16 mg dry weight 1 /14 days for the late summer-early fall period. The limiting nutrient switched from phosphorus to nitrogen during the fall months, also indicating the potential for a Nostoc bloom. All indicators showed that Black Lake was highly productive in 1984 despite the absence of a toxic Nostoc bloom. Water transparency ranqed from 0.8 to 3.4 m, averaging 1.2 m from June to October. pH values went as high as 8.2, with the total absence of CO2 in some of the littoral areas. Dissolved oxygen values were at super saturated levels throughout most of the sampling reqime. Diatoms (Fragilaria sp., Melosira sp., and Asterionella sp.) dominated the phytoplankton composition with Nostoc only showing up in early August. Chlorophyll 11 a11 values correlated with phytoplankton trends, with highs of 15 to 31 mgl-1, and lows of 0 to 5 mgl-1. The fact that Black Lake is clearly eutrophic, and that the potential for a blue-green bloom was present but did not materialize, may possibly be explained by two factors ... climatoloqical trends and stratification pattern. The absence of a well developed hypolimion along with excessive cloudiness and lack of a protacted calm, bright, and warm fall may have accounted for the lack of a toxic bloom in Black Lake during 1984.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198508,iwdl-cda_kann_1985,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,91
"Physical and chemical water quality of the Spokane River outlet reach of Lake Coeur d'Alene, Kootenai County, Idaho 1990 and 1991","Falter, C. Michael; Riggers, B.; Carlson, J. W.",1992-03,Spokane River; Lake Coeur d'Alene,"47.69, -116.81",water quality; flow; chemical composition; bacteria (coliform),"The University of Idaho conducted a water quality study on the Spokane River outlet arm of Lake Coeur d'Alene from June, 1990 through September, 1991. The project was sponsored by the Idaho Division of Environmental Quality (Coeur d'Alene office). Objectives of the study were to: 1) Characterize baseline river water quality; 2) determine seasonal river water quality variation; 3) assess diel temperature and dissolved oxygen changes for indications of aquatic ecosystem stress; and 4) provide a cursory view of the effects of existing and proposed wastewater discharges on river water quality, to the extent that river water quality data and WWTP data will allow. The study updated earlier work by the University of Idaho and USEPA in 1980 and 1988. The study area covered the 8.1-mile reach of the Spokane River from the outlet of Lake Coeur d'Alene at River Mile 108.8 downstream to just below Post Falls Dam at River Mile 100.7. This reach is typified by swift water currents and cobble bottom channel in the upper section merging to deeper, slower lacustrine conditions in the lower section where channel cobbles yield to fine sediments in lateral embayments. Water depths ranged from 2 to 18 m through the reach. Water flows in the 16-month study ranged from high flows of 31,750 cfs in May, 1990 to low flows of 340 cfs in September, 1990. Retention times of the study reach varied from 4.3 hours at annual high flows in 1990 and 1991, respectively, to 12.7 days at annual low flows in 1990 and 1991. Surface water temperatures peaked at 25.7 and 26.1 C in 1990 and 1991. Vertical thermal stratification was minimal, always less than 3.0 C from surface to bottom. Slight summer temperature increases were noted downstream through the reach. Sample site mean summer dissolved oxygen was always greater than 7.0 mg/1; one sample occurrence was recorded of 5.4 mg/1. Electrical conductivity generally ranged from 30 to 55 umhos. Median pH was slightly on the acid side (5.7 to 7.8) throughout the reach. Secchi depth ranged from 2.4 to 6.5 m with a study average of 4.0 m. High flows coincided with low secchi depths, as a result of suspended sediments and an extended spring algae pulse. Mean year-round chlorophyll a averaged 2.5 and 4.2 mg/m3 at the upper and lower sections of this river reach for an average 73% increase over the 7.6 mile reach. Mean summer chlorophyll a of the lower sections averaged 6.0 mg/m3 in 1990 but only 3.3 mg/m3 in 1991 (= 45% reduction) following 1) a very large spring algae bloom, and 2) 80% phosphorus removal from the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. The 1990 and 1991 chlorophyll a levels place the Spokane River in mesotrophic and meso-oligotrophic productivity ranges, rexi spectively. Mean Kjeldahl nitrogen was 0.18 mg/1 and generally increased &gt;20% below the Coeur d'Alene WWTP at low flows. There was a general trend of TKN increasing downstream through the study reach. The WWTPs contributed 25 to 50% of the TKN load to the Spokane River at low flows. Nitrate nitrogen was typically less than 0.05 mg/1 through summer months with fall-winter maxima of 0.50 mg/1. At low flows, WWTPs supplied 40% of the total nitrate load to the river. Mean total ammonia in the Spokane River arm of Lake Coeur d'Alene was 0.14 mg/1. From RM 111.1 to 108.8, there typically was an average 75% increase of total ammonia in the River, but less than one third of that increase was from the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. However, 30% of the average summer ammonia load to the river was from the Coeur d'Alene WWTP (up to 60% of the total ammonia load in September, 1991 at 340 cfs river flow). Total phosphorus ranged from 0.007 to 0.025 mg/1 with a study mean of 0.014 mg/1  (in the mesotrophic range). Total phosphorus increased 70% between RM 111.1 and 108.8over the entire study. Summer total phosphorus increased 87% between RM 111.1 and 108.8 over the entire study, 187% in 1991, but showed a 30% decline in 1991 after phosphorus removal in the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. WWTPs contributed -50% of the total phosphorus load to the reach at low flows. Upgrading the Coeur d'Alene WWTP in June, 1991 resulted in an effluent TP decline of 79%. Total N:total P ratios indicate phosphorus limitation most of the time with the exception of summer-fall 1990. BODs levels in the Spokane River were moderately high, averaging 3.4 mg/1 over all sites and dates. WWTP BODs levels from the Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls plants averaged 81.2 and 13.2 mg/1, respectively. Mean BODs increased 14% in the lower four river sites compared to the two upstream sites. Ultimate BOD in the Spokane River averaged 10.7 mg/1. WWTP ultimate BOD levels from the Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls plants averaged 644.7 and 371 mg/1, respectively. Mean ultimate BOD increased 11% in the lowest river site compared to the uppermost site. Median fecal coliform bacteria in the Spokane River were -1 colony/100 ml except for immediately below the WWTPs. Median fecal coliform bacteria were 30 and 24 colonies/100 ml in the Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls WWTPs, respectively. Median fecal coliform bacteria increased -30-fold from above to immediately below the Coeur d'Alene WWTP. River fecal coliform levels dropped to background concentrations within two river miles. Median fecal coliform bacteria increased -2-fold from above to immediately below the Post Falls WWTP. The diel study in August, 1991 showed insignificant stratification of either temperature or oxygen and little day-to-night fluctuation of either temperature or oxygen.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199207,iwdl-cda_falter_1992,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,92

"Potential for heavy metal migration from sediments of Lake Coeur d'Alene into the Rathdrum Prairie aquifer, Kootenai County, Idaho; Research technical completion report","Wyman, Susan A.",1993-11,Rathdrum Prairie; Kootenai,"47.79, -116.86",heavy metals; eutrophication; sediment,"The purpose of this project was to determine the potential for migration of heavy metals of Lake Coeur d'Alene into the Spokane Valley/Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, as a result of changing lake chemistry caused by eutrophication. The upper sediment layers in Lake Coeur d'Alene are enriched in heavy metals and the lake appears to be becoming more eutrophic. The geologic history of the region contributes to the understanding of the hydrogeology of the study area.  The coarse-grained glacial outwash aquifer is bounded below by fine-grained sediments of the Latah formation, and bounded laterally by Precambrian sediments and metasediments. A conceptual model for surface water/groundwater interaction reveals that the cross sectional area of the aquifer increases from the northern end of Lake Coeur d'Alene farther into the aquifer. This could account for the steep hydraulic gradient from the lake to the aquifer. The steep gradient could also be a result of fine sediments which have infiltrated the glacial outwash and have decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, adjacent to the lake. Evidence for the infiltration of fine material exists in grain size analyses and unpublished reports. Lake Coeur d'Alene is dimictic and oligotrophic to eutrophic. Oxygen enrichment in the epilimnion and depletion in the hypolimnion are well-documented phenomena in eutrophic lakes. Dissolved oxygen concentrations as low as 52% were measured by the USGS northeast of Blue Point near Harrison in September, 1991. Anoxic, reducing conditions in the hypolimnion during summer stratification of the water column may cause Mn and Fe mobilization from sediments. Dissolved heavy metals in the hypolimnion are likely to coprecipitate with Mn oxyhydroxides (and to a lesser extent iron hydroxides) when the metals encounter more oxygenated water. Seismic profiles of the lake bottom indicate that fine, laminated sediments cover the central portions of the lake and thin out near the lake margins. These sediments contain elevated metals concentrations in both particulate form and in sediment pore water. The concentration gradient of metals in pore waters probably contributes to the upward migration of metals and the development of an enriched band of Fe, Mn and other trace metals in the sediment column. The band of Fe and Mn may reduce the concentration of trace metals in the water column (Sigg, 1987). The bulk of the water which moves from the lake into the aquifer during the summer """"low flow"""" period leaves Lake Coeur d'Alene as underflow. The area through which most water moves is probably within 300 feet (90 m) of the shore, where fine, laminated lake bottom sediments are lacking. This zone is probably well oxygenated for most of the year. Analyses from four monitoring wells at the surface water-groundwater interface reveal that metal concentrations are elevated in groundwater. Concentrations of Fe and Mn exceeded EPA SMCLs in all four wells. Three wells exceeded EPA MCLs for selenium. Well AIP-2 exceeded EPA MCLs for As, Cd and Ph. Clay samples from the well were highly enriched in As, Co and Cu, but only slightly above average background concentrations in Fe, Mn, Zn, U, and Th. The concentrations of Pb, Ni, Sr, V, and Cr in clays were slightly below average background concentrations. Metal migration into the aquifer does not appear to be attenuated by ionic adsorption onto clay materials. Eutrophication may have positive benefits for metal removal from the water column, as algae and Mn adsorb and precipitate trace metals. This benefit may be offset by the reducing conditions and elevated pH which result from aphotic biological activity in the hypolimnion.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; University of Idaho Department of Geology and Geological Engineering,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199303,iwdl-cda_wyman_1993,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"Adobe Acrobat 10.1.3 Paper capture plug-in, 7,879,153 bytes; Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,95

Metal concentrations Md, Cd, Mg, Ca, Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe, Na and K; water quality and phytoplankton composition-density were determined for thirty-five dates during this period. Additional sampling included unpolluted portions of Coeur d'Alene Lake from December, 1969, to November, 1970, and the unaffected St. Joe River during the summers of 1969-70. Primary production ranged from 17.6 to 1337.9 mg C/m /day in the  Coeur d'Alene River and 69.3 to 1714.5 mg C/m2/day in the Coeur d'Alene Lake. Concentrations of zinc (0.1 to 11.2 mg Zn/1) and copper (0.0 to0.6 mg Cu/1) in the Coeur d'Alene River indicated that heavy metals could be toxic to algae. Diatoms dominated phytoplankton in the Coeur d'Alene River, Lake, and St. Joe River. Primary production in the southern portion of Coeur d'Alene Lake appeared controlled by discharges from the Coeur d'Alene and St. Joe rivers. Low concentrations of inorganic carbon and moderately high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate in the Coeur d'Alene River, Lake and St. Joe River suggest the importance of carbon in regulating production. The effect of wind on eplimnetic production and poorly developed stratification in the south end of the lake appeared related to decreased depths. Wind action may control eutrophication by suppressing hypolimnetic oxygen depletion and anaerobic regeneration. Nannoplankton from Coeur d'Alene Lake were exposed to known concentrations of Cu2+, Cd 2+, Zn 2+ and dilutions of Coeur d'Alene River water under controlled light and temperature. Inhibitory effects of separate and interacting metals on carbon-14 uptake by algae were assessed with factorial designed bioassays and response surfaces. Copper, cadmium, and zinc were acutely and synergistically toxic to carbon uptake by phytoplankton. Concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 0.75 mg Cu/1, 0.1 to 0.3 mg Cd/1, and 0.1 to 1.5 mg Zn/1. Copper caused an overriding effect on two- and three-way interactions of Cu 2+ , Cd 2+ , and Zn 2+ . Dilutions of Coeur d'Alene River water decreased Cu and Zn toxicity.

Water quality data show heavy inflows of nutrients during late spring into Coeur d'Alene Lake from the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene Rivers and Plummer Creek.  Although no water devoid of dissolved oxygen have been measured, 2-4  mg/1 have been measured in the southern portion of the lake.  Phytoplankton productivity measurements and bottom organism identification and enumeration have shown that the lake functions at several trophic levels, meso-eutrophic to eutrophic in the southern portion, mesotrophic in the immediate area of the Coeur d'Alene River and ogliotrophic in the northern portions.  High metal concentrations (1000-7000 mg/kg Zn) in the bottom sediment of the middle and northern portions of the lake did not appear to substantially affect distribution of benthic chironomids or ogliochaetes.  Lake sediment cores taken across the delta region of the Coeur d'Alene River penetrated through the region of high metallic concentration and allowed an average sediment deposition rate to be calculated.  Algal toxicity tests showed the amount of Zn normally present in the Coeur d'Alene River and Spokane River to be inhibitory to the algal test organism Selanastrum capricornutum.  The water quality of the Spokane River was shown to be of good to excellent quality in all parameters tested except for high metallic content, especially Zn.  Activation and atomic absorption analysis of metallic content in the tissues of the organisms populating the Spokane River indicated that the algae were the prime concetrators of Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, Fe, and Mn.  Algae and detritus consumers such as the larvae of caddisfly Hydropsyche and the nymphs of the mayfly Baetis reflected high metallic concentrations.  Most higher aquatic plants showed relatively lower concentrations.  Analysis of fish tissues showed considerably less concentration of metals than the aquatic plants, insects or algae.  However, Zn was measured at concentrations of 80-200 mg/kg in liver tissues of several species of fishes.  Fillet tissues generally contained less than one quarter of these amounts.  The fish, when collected, did not appear under stress leading the investigators to believe that most of the metals--although present in relatively high concentration in the tissues of the orgamisms tested--must be in a relatively innocuous state.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,"Co-investigators: Dunigan, Jr., Paul F.

Mining and milling wastes were transported by the river during flood events until 1968 when tailings ponds were built. Lake bed sediments in Killarney Lake were sampled at three separate localities using a piston core sampler operated from a raft. The cores collected 3.6 m and 3.5 m of lake bottom sediments from the north and south ends of the lake, respectively, and 6.4 m of sediments from the center of the lake. Lake bed sediments were also sampled to a depth of 59 em using a freezer box sampler. A control core and freezer box section were extracted from Bells Lake in the nearby St. Joe River drainage, an area free of commercial mining practices. Identification of the Mazama ash, which was collected at 6.1 m below lake bottom in Killarney Lake and 3.8 m below lake bottom in Bells Lake, by microprobe analysis enabled the chronology of cores from both lakes to be constrained. The lake bottom sediments were sampled to. evaluate heavy metal concentrations downstream of the mining district. Sediments were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry for As, Ag, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Sediments from Bells Lake showed similar chemistry to the pre-mining sediments in Killarney Lake, suggesting that Bells Lake was an adequate control. High concentrations of heavy metals are present in the top 59 em of the Killarney Lake bed at the center and deepest portion of the lake. Up to 17.5 em of metallic silt were collected at the north and south ends of the lake. The highest observed metal concentrations in the sediment were 376 ppm As, 37 ppm Ag, 475 ppm Cu, 146 ppm Cd, 111,000 ppm Fe, 13,440 ppm Mn, 71 ppm Ni, 37,400 ppm Pb, and 32,850 ppm Zn. In this uppermost layer, concentrations of metals are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than in deeper Killarney Lake sediments or in Bells Lake. A sharp, defined contact was observed between the natural organic silt and the introduced metallic silt. Organic silt was also observed overlying the metallic silt in the freezer box sample. Sediments with heavy metal concentrations above that of background were found to occur a maximum of 22.5 em below the lower metallic silt and organic silt contact.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199101,iwdl-cda_bender_1991,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,99

Lake Coeur d'Alene in northern Idaho was chosen for the study as a water system which would reflect the more subtle impacts of ash fallout in contrast to the immediate and devastating impact to lakes and streams near the volcano. The specific objectives were to quantify and identify volcanic ash in the lake sediments and water columns, describe chemical conditions in the sediments and water columns, and to assess the effects of volcanic tephra on the benthic, phytoplankton, and zooplankton communities. The ash layer was relatively uniform in thickness throughout the lake and delta sediments. Sediments deposited over the initial ash layer contained only small quantities of ash. The ash layer in the lake sediments and throughout the watershed was stable and not easily resuspended or eroded.

M.",1985-10,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.52, -116.53",mine wastes; water pollution; arsenic; speciation; groundwater pollution;,"The Coeur d' Alene Mining District is one of the major silver, lead, and zinc producing areas in the United States. The area also encompasses some of the foremost pollution problems in Idaho. The primary problems of environmental concern in this area today are the operating and abandoned tailings piles scattered throughout the district, the huge quantities of mine wastes accumulated along the streams, and the acid mine drainage from existing mines in the district. From previous studies, it is known that mine wastes containing iron sulfide (pyrite) in this area are capable of producing acid waters under oxidizing conditions. The redox status of ground water is an important factor in determining the degree of acid water formation and subsequent leaching of metals from mine tailings and ore bodies in this mining area. A new approach for measurement of the redox status of ground water involving analysis of water samples for concentrations of two arsenic species, As(V) and As(III), has been studied in this project. Based on thermodynamic equilibrium considerations, the apparent redox conditions can be evaluated from measured ratios of As(V)/As(III) in water. A simple solvent extraction method has been developed for the separation of arsenic species in mine waters using ammonium pyrrolidinedthiocarbamate (APDTC) as a chelatinq agent. The APDTC extraction method combined with neutron activation technique provides a very sensitive method for determining arsenic species in natural water systems. A detection limit of 0.1 ppb for the arsenic species in natural waters can be easily achieved using this method. This analytical method for arsenic speciation study is in the process of being published by ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Ground water samples were collected from a major lead-zinc mine (the Bunker Hill Mine) and from other locations of the Coeur d'Alene Mininq District to study the relationships between the arsenic species and other water quality data. The As(V)/As(III) ratios in ground waters collected from the Bunker Hill Mine were found to vary by more than two orders of magnitude indicating a wide range of redox conditions existing in the mine. The quality of ground water in the mine is strongly correlated with the ratio of As(V)/As(III) found in the system. Good quality waters were generally associated with low ratios (&lt;1) of As(V)/As(III). The ratio of the arsenic species and the concentrations of dissolved metals in the mine waters varied considerably with time. During the spring run-off, very high As(V)/As(III) ratios were observed in some poor quality waters presumably due to leaching of oxidized ores and mine wastes in certain locations of the upper levels of the mine. In the late summer, the ratio of As(V)/As(III) decreased as the system became more anaerobic and the water quality showed significant improvement correspondingly. The distribution of the arsenic species appears to be a useful chemical indicator to evaluate the potential of acid water formation and associated metal pollution problems in the ground water systems of this and other similar mining areas.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198512,iwdl-cda_wai_1985,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,102

The study was initiated to develop alternate management solutions for correcting the problem of increasing high water table problems which has been causing inconvenience and financial hardships to local residents. A more fundamental reason for the study was to develop methods of solving regional groundwater problems. Water levels in wells raise a s much a s 40 feet during the irrigation season to within one - three feet of the surface in some areas. The study area has a dense network of canals with seepage rates averaging 3.5 cubic feet per square foot per day, irrigated soils with high infiltration rates and in some cases inefficient irrigation practices have contributed to t h e f a c t that diversions for irrigation are significant in excess of the state average. In 1970 the net diversion from the Snake River was 16.5 acre feet per irrigated acre and the net irrigation application was 9.6 acre feet per acre for the entire irrigation season. The mathematical model is a digital model and utilizes alternating direction implicit procedures for finite difference solutions to the basic flow equations. A special treatment of a flow boundary is incorporated in the model. Data on water table fluctuation, soils, crop distribution, irrigation diversions, distribution system losses and wastes, evapotranspiration, and irrigation practices were obtained for input to the model. The input data to the model is evaluated in two separate input programs in order to keep the actual program of the model a s general a s possible.

Recreation carrying capacity and Wild Rivers: a case study of the Middle Fork of the Salmon,"Godfrey, E. Bruce; Peckfelder, Robert L.",1972-07-25,Salmon River Basin,"45.77, -115.08",recreation wastes; water pollution control;,"One of the eight instant wild rivers designated by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. The Middle Fork, the original ''river of no return'', is born at the confluence of Marsh and Bear Valley Creeks: some twenty miles northeast of Stanley, and flows northward for about 100 miles through one of America's deepest gorges to join the min stem of the Salmonbelow Shoup. It is a fast-flowing stream with numerous rapids and falls. Stretches of relative calm, however, can ''ease one to sleep'' before the next series of rapids greets the-unsuspecting floater. The lower 80 miles of the river is part of the Idaho Primitive Area. The fast-flowing, relatively pure and primitive characteristics of the river has nude it a national attraction for recreationists . River runners, hunters, f ishermen, sightseers, and backpackers commonly confront the rugged confines of the area during the short summer season when snow packs allow access. Until the mid 1940's, only a limited nmber of hunters, prospectors, trappers, and fishermen used the area. In 1959, the Forest Service constructed a road to the upper reaches of the river that opened the area up and allowed a substantial increase in recreational use. For example, between 1962 and 1971 the number of Middle Fork floaters increased more than five times. The large increase in recreational use on the Middle Fork has helped generate considerable concern on the part of the Forest Service regarding the inpact of this use on the environment of the area. Should use be limited? If so, when, how, and why? In an effort to provide some insight into these matters a study was initiated in 1970 to determine the recreational carrying capacity of the Middle Fork.

The timber resource in the Salmon River basin was inventoried and evaluated. Based on the information gathered it was concluded that classification of the river would have little effect on the timber industry in the area. The methodology developed around general steps to take in evaluating the timber resource in relation to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. It was suggested that once it was decided that the river qualified for the System, the researcher suggest various classification schemes for the river. Then rapid, unrefined estimates be made of the amount and value of the affected timber resource. A market base should be selected and the evaluation done on a sustained yield basis. More refined estimates can be made at a later time if warranted. Also discussed were factors involving forestry and system rivers such as selection of interest rate and a land value base. It was determined that the main ties between forestry and system rivers related mainly to transportation, water quality, water quantity, and aesthetics. Harvest types and techniques and their relation to system rivers was discussed, and an interpretation of the Act and guidelines in relation to system rivers was presented.

Moscow basin ground water studies. Pamphlet 153,"Jones, Robert W.; Ross, Sylvia H.",1972-03,Moscow,"46.77, -116.96",water properties; chemical composition; artesian aquifers; water table decline; artificial recharge;,"Moscow basin is in Latah County, Idaho, or the eastern edge of the Columbia Plateau physiographic province. The area of the basin is about 58 square miles. The principal water users, City of Moscow and University of Idaho, depend exclusively on ground water obtained from wells that reach three zones of artesian aquifers in the basalt flows and sedimentary interbeds of the Columbia River Group of Miocene age. The three artesian zones are designated the upper, middle, and Bower artesian zones, The Columbia River Group is overlain by surficial sediments in which water generally occurs under water-table conditions, The Columbia River Group is underlain by a basement of crystalline rocks of pre-Tertiary age that also crops out beyond the limits of the basalt and forms the mountains that rim the basin on thee sides. Where exposed at the surface, the crystalline basement contains water under water-table conditions. Neither the surficial sediments nor the crystalline basement will yield large amounts of water; the rocks of the Columbia River Group are the only source of water for public supplies. All ground water originates as precipitation that falls within the borders of Moscow basin; natural discharge of ground water is by underflow to the west. Prior to 1960, the entire public supply was obtained from wells reaching the upper artesian zone. The quality of water was unsatisfactory because of excessive amounts of iron and moderate hardness. Between 1960 and 1965, wells were drilled into the middle and lower artesian zones, and by 1965, nearly all water pumped for public supplies was obtained from the middle and lower artesian zones. The waters from the middle and lower artesian zones contain only moderate amounts of iron and are relatively soft. In 1896, water levels In wells in the upper artesian zone were at or slightly above land surface but declined continuously thereafter and, by 1968, static levels were nearly 120 feet below the surface in the vicinity of the City of Moscow wells. This decline led to suggestions that ground water recharge in Moscow basin was insufficient to balance pumpage. Following the phasing out of heavy pumpage of the upper artesian zone in 1960-1965, water levels rose and recovered to within 65 feet of the surface in 1969. In our studies, two lines of investigation indicate that pumpage was not in excess of recharge during the period 1896-1960. We analyzed the pumpage and water level records of the public supply wells, using a mathematical model aquifer that utilizes the theory of image wells and assumes that there is no recharge to the basin. The results indicate that the decline of water levels in the upper artesian zone was actually much less than it would have been if pumpage was greatly in excess of recharge. We also studied the long-term records of water level fluctuations in observation wells in the basin. The water table in the surficial aquifers remained stable during the time that the water levels in the upper artesian zone declined. We attributed the decline in the water levels in the upper artesian zone to barrier boundary effects rather than to lack of recharge. The results of our studies support the views of previous workers who estimate ground water recharge to the basin by use of the equation of hydrologic equilibrium. All such estimates indicate that recharge is in excess of pumpage sufficient to meet the demands of the basin through the year 2000, We also used our no-recharge mathematical model aquifers to estimate the total water in ground water storage in Moscow basin and to predict the decline in water levels that would occur by the year 2000. Although these figures are based on an assumption that we have rejected--no recharge to the basin--they do represent the smallest amount of water and the largest amount of drawdown to be expected. The study indicates that the middle and lower artesian zones would meet the anticipated 1965-2000 demand of 50.1 billion gallons and still have as much as 299.4 billion gallons remaining in storage in the year 2000. Water levels would b e from 50 t o 80 feet lower in 2908 than they were in 1965. This study indicates that ground water can supply the anticipated needs of Moscow basin well into the 21st century regardless of whether the water is derived from ground water storage or from recharge. If need for water should exceed natural recharge at some time in the future, artificial recharge utilizing water from sources in and near Moscow basin could furnish more than 1 billion gallons of additional water annually. During a normal year, spring runoff from intermittent streams in the Palouse Range can provide about 300 million gallons over a 90 day period during February through May. The Moscow Waste Water Treatment Plant now discharges about 300 million gallons annually; the discharge should increase to about 1 billion gallons by the year 2000. The effluent could be further treated, then recycled by artificial recharge. Mathematical model studies show that the existing wells in the upper artesian zone can accept artificial recharge at rates of 1000 to 2000 gpm for as many as 100 consecutive days without the cone of impression reaching the surface. Cost of artificial recharge probably is less than the cost of long-distance importation of water. The waters of the surficial aquifers are relatively soft, averaging 87 ppm hardness as CaC03, and are relatively low in dissolved solids, averaging 127 ppm. As the waters move into the upper artesian zone, average hardness increases to 135 ppm and average dissolved solids increases to 190 ppm., probably as the result of solution of magnesium from magnesium-rich minerals in the basalts . As the waters move through the middle artesian zone and into the lower artesian zone, average hardness decreases to 84 ppm, but average dissolved solids increases to 286 ppm,; the decrease in hardness probably is the result of base exchange of sodium for calcium. Calcium and bicarbonate are the dominant ions in most of the ground waters of Moscow basin, but calcium and sulfate or sodium plus calcium and bicarbonate are the dominate ions in a few of the waters. Excessive amounts of iron are moderately common in waters from the surficial aquifers and very common in waters from the upper artesian zone. The iron originates in high-iron clay deposits in the surficial aquifers on the outer margin of the recharge area of the artesian aquifers. The high-iron waters move laterally from the clay deposits into the upper artesian zone. Waters from the middle and lower artesian zones contained only moderate amounts of iron when the aquifers were first placed into use. Continued pumpage could induce the high-iron waters to move into the middle and lower artesian zones. Silica also is somewhat high for ground waters and the origin of the silica probably is related to the origin of the iron. Some of the waters in the surficial aquifers contain relatively high amounts of nitrates and chlorides that indicate possible contamination from septic tanks, fertilizers, and barn-yard wastes .",,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology,University of Idaho,eng,197212,iwdl-197212,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,112

Migration response of juvenile chinook salmon to substrates and temperatures,"Morrill, Charles Franklin",1972-05,Lemhi River,"44.7, -113.5",fish; fish migration; water temperature; substrates;,I assessed downstream migration of age 0+ chinook salmon from stream channels with rock and rubble (good) or gravel or shale (poor) substrates and constant or declining water temperatures during the fall months of 1970 and 1971. As water temperatures declined juvenile chinook left stream channels with gravel or shale substrates or moved into available hiding spaces in stream channels with rock and rubble substrate . Fish initially emigrated as temperatures declined below 10 C. I believe the number of emigrants reflects the holding capacity of the substrate and the density of the fish population. The migration response varied with size and race of fish. I attribute most of the response difference between races to differences in fish size. I contend that juvenile spring chinook find rock and rubble substrate an important component of their winter habitat.

These studies have involved, for the most part, one of two general approaches. First, a large number of laboratory investigations have been conducted for the purpose of determining specific nutrient requirements of a particular algal species with the determination based upon maintaining that species under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. Secondly, investigation has involved field studies with the objective being to determine changes in ambient concentrations of a variety of growth promoting substances in relation t o changes in algal populations especially during the summer months. In addition there have been other studies more limited in number in which a combination of these two broad types of investigation have been attempted.

"A finite-element, planar-flow model of Camas Prairie, Idaho","Wallace, Richard Warren;",1972-11,Camas Creek,"43.33, -115.73",groundwater basins; groundwater flow; finite element method; plane flow;,"Modern digital computers and mathematical models have been applied to fluid flow problems since the 1960's. Through the use of these tools, problems can be approached where the solutions at discrete points within the field of interest are sufficient. In this study a finite-element, planar-flow model was applied to a ground-water basin in southern Idaho, using a program developed by Dr. R. L. Taylor of the University of California at Berkeley. The area studied is an intermontane valley in Carnas and Elmore counties, Idaho, and consists of a prairie of valley-fill material that partially fills a valley about 30 miles long and 8-10 miles wide. The valley sides and surrounding areas are composed mainly of igneous and volcanic rocks that are relatively impermeable. The basement rock beneath the valley floor is assumed to be of the same material as the sides . The ground-water system consists of a shallow water table aquifer, a clay unit and 2 artesian aquifers separated by relatively impermeable silty clay. The model program is fitted to the geologic and hydrologic conditions of the area. A finite-element mesh is developed corresponding to a geologic section parallel to the valley axis. Input parameters to the model program are annual precipitation, permeabilities of the various units, boundaries and the geometric positions of positions of the mesh nodes with reference to a spatial coordinate system. The program computes head, potential, flow velocities in 2 directions normal to each other, resultant flow velocity and resultant flow direction with respect to the coordinate system, for each element in the mesh. The model seems to give an adequate representation of the ground-water system of the basin, based on comparison of computed hydraulic heads with actual measurements of water levels and artesian heads. Flow quantities are computed for underflow at the output end of the section, using average annual precipitation as input. Underflow is also computed for simulated situations of 3 and 6 inches more than and less than average annual precipitation. Changes in underflow equivalent to 4-0.03 and -0.05 feet of water input indicate that the artesian aquifers are essentially insulated from changes in annual precipitation in any given year. This type model should have practical use not only for describing a flow system but also for simulating past, future and/or locally changed conditions.",,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197221,iwdl-197221,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,119

As water temperatures declined juvenile chinook left stream channels with gravel or shale substrates or moved into available hiding spaces in stream channels with rock and rubble substrate . Fish initially emigrated as temperatures declined below 10 C. I believe the number of emigrants reflects the holding capacity of the substrate and the density of the fish population. The migration response varied with size and race of fish. I attribute most of the response difference between races to differences in fish size.

Questionnaires were mailed to 327 landowners whose properties are located within the land area which could be affected by Wild and Scenic Rivers restrictions. A total of 54.4% of the landowners responded to the questionnaire. Approximately 76% of the affected land area downstream from Avery is privately owned, whereas the affected land area upstream from Avery is in national forest. Results of the survey revealed that 68.8% of the resident landowners were strongly opposed to classifying the lower segment of the St. Joe River from Avery to the conclusion of the river at Beedle Point on Coeur d'Alene Lake. Forty-three percent of the absentee landowners (not residing in the St. Joe River Basin) were also strongly opposed to classifying this segment of the river. In contrast, the majority of landowners were either strongly or mildly in favor of including the entire river upstream from Avery in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Opposition to classifying the lower St. Joe River was based on landowners' perceptions of the degree to which Wild and Scenic Rivers restrictions would affect: (1) The free flow of traffic through the river Corridor, (2) property values and taxes, (3) personal income, (4) area economy, and (5) continued recreational use (or abuse) of private property.",,Scenic River Study,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197204,iwdl-197204,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,143

The model was developed by making suitable modifications to an existing model which had been used for the Boise River study. The Blackfoot River model is steady state, deterministic and onedimensional. It has been calibrated and verified and has been found satisfactory under the limitations of the observed data and the complexity of the ecosystem. The technique of model application has been illustrated with the help of arbitrary waste discharges at selected points in the basin. Two hypothetical combinations of inputs have been assumed. The effects of these discharges on the water quality of the streams have been simulated by the model. The model can be useful in deciding the management policies for phosphate mining and processing operations in order to mitigate or avoid their adverse impacts on water quality of the streams. The model can be adapted to the planning of these operations as well as to the planning and management of other human activities in the area with regard to their water quality impacts. Proposals for improving the data collection system in the basin include: (i) coordination of data collection programs of the various agencies, (ii) hydrologic and water quality data gathering on ungauged major tributaries and on the main stems of the Diamond Creek and the Blackfoot River, and (iii) collection of essential weather data in the basin .",,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197919,iwdl-197919,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,144

Resource allocation under stress: the Snake River in Idaho,"Slaughter, Richard A.",2012-06-25,Snake River,,water supply; water resources development; irrigation water; Snake River; water use; water resources development -- Idaho -- Government policy; water in agriculture; appropriation; irrigation; appropriation; climate adaptation; institutional adaptation; water resource development; social policy; development; governance; property rights,"The debate over management of and adaptation to climate change tends to focus on expert regulation vs. private exploitation.  A third path is available:  an institutional set in which preferred behaviors are automatically encouraged by shared resource ownership.  In water, for example, users can be joint owners of a resource rather than customers of a utility or subject to a regulatory agency.  User behavior differs markedly between the two situations.  This book is a study of the Snake River as an example of informal, multi-faceted governance under conditions of growth, climate variability, and changing social preferences. The participants in the story include surface and groundwater irrigators, the State of Idaho, the Idaho legislature, federal agencies, Congress, the President of the United States, the judicial system, and native tribes. While many of the entities involved are governmental agencies, they do not possess formal regulatory authority over use of the River or allocation of its water. They are more like participants in a multifaceted social contract, in which each has claims but none is in a controlling position, and are caught up in an ongoing dance over allocation and use. In this dance, the judicial system acts as an outside constraint and motivator, but because of its own inefficiencies not as a determining player in the outcome.  The implications of climate change for water resources raise the question of how well water institutions in the Western United States might be expected to adapt to changed volume or timing of water flows. Particularly in basins where snowpack provides substantial storage, late season flows will be significantly reduced and underground recharge from slowly melting snow will also be reduced. Within that context, it would be helpful to develop an understanding of what institutional structures are conducive to adaptation, and to what extent new or changed institutions might be required or expected to emerge. This study examines these questions in the context of the Snake River in southern Idaho. The Snake provides a useful case study for several reasons: it lies almost entirely within a single state, Idaho, and thus within a single water law jurisdiction; it is coupled with an extensive aquifer, providing complexities of hydrologic and legal interaction that make it a complete case; and the water law underlying Snake River water allocation is based in the prior appropriation doctrine, providing a test of whether that doctrine continues to be useful.  A Snake River study has another value as well. The Snake history encompasses a major shift of public-policy preference from development of the West (19th and early 20th centuries) to protecting environmental values from development pressure (late 20th century). During the period of development priority, public policy explored several public and private models to realize the scale economies required for irrigation and hydropower. Simultaneously, institutional innovations were required to deal with climate variability, primarily in the form of drought. Finally, as the river became fully appropriated and public preferences changed in the late 20th century, institutions had to deal with changes in use and resource scarcity in the context of a growing population and changing economy.  The contents cover evolution of the system and governance; policy tools developed by the University of Idaho and the Idaho Department of Water Resources to assist management of water rights; special problems posed by conjunctive use of ground and surface water; and case studies in the ongoing institutional development to accommodate change.",,,,"Climate Impacts Group, University of Washington; IWRRI; Slaughter, Richard A.; Wiener, John D.; Contor, Bryce A.; Schmidt, R.D.; Creamer, Michael C.; Cosgrove, Donna M., Johnson, Gary S.; Tuthill, David R.; Fereday, Jeffrey C.; Rigby, Jerry R.",University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201203,iwdl-201203,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012-06-27,"PDFpenPro version 1.4 (Acrobat 5.x), 23555,763 bytes",Jodi Haire,,147

The benthic community of the South Fork and mainstem was monitored from 1968-1971 and 1987-1991 to ascertain the effects of improved mine wastewater treatment and mine closures. Zinc concentrations decreased from 21 mg/l to 3 mg/l over this period. Subsequently, the benthic community showed a dramatic recovery as evidenced by large increases in species richness (0-18), Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera index (0-8), and species diversity (0-1.8). Although considerable recovery has occurred, biotic parameters at impacted sites continue to lag behind those at reference sites, probably due to continued high zinc concentrations and poor habitat structure. A rapid bioassessment study was conducted on the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River and selected tributaries in northern Idaho. Species richness, Ephemeroptera-PlecopteraTrichoptera (EPT) index, and species diversity showed strong negative correlations with habitat assessment scores (mean r 2 =.68). Regression coefficients for percent dominant taxon, modified Hilsenhoff's index, and EPT/Chironomidae abundance were generally lower (mean r 2=.42). Zinc was negatively correlated with biotic metrics (r2=.23-.58). Values for EPT (r2=.60-.75) and species richness (r2=.54-.65) provided the highest correlation coefficients of the six metrics measured. Conductivity (r2=.18-.41) and pH (r2=.08-.21) showed the weakest correlations with biotic metrics. Streams affected by metal pollution also exhibited extreme habitat degradation due to activities involved in ore processing.

Medicine and Thompson Lakes are two of the 11 lateral lakes of the Coeur d'Alene River that lie on the flood plain. In their bottom sediments is preserved a stratigraphic record of upstream mining operations. A freeze box, designed by a Quaternary geologist in Finland, was used to sample the lake bottom sediments.

Chemical speciation of arsenic and antimony in natural water systems and its applications to environmental problems,"Mok, Wai Man",1988-05,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.51, -116.15",heavy metals; mine wastes; sediment; speciation,"A method for the speciation of trivalent and pentavalent states of inorganic arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) in natural waters has been developed. The proposed method first extracts the trivalent As(III) and Sb(III) as pyrrolidinecarbodithioate (PCDT) complexes into chloroform, followed by a nitric acid back-extraction to recover the elements. Arsenic and Sb in the acid solution are determined by neutron activation analysis (NAA). The pentavalent species, As(V) and Sb(V), are reduced to the trivalent state using potassium iodide and sodium thiosulfate and then are extracted with PCDT for NAA. The two-step preconcentration procedure provides a large enrichment factor, eliminates the interfering matrix species, and extends the useful working range of NAA for As and Sb. The extraction method has also been applied to the determination of low levels of As and Sb in biological samples by NAA. The speciation method has been used to evaluate the distribution of As(III) and As(V) and its relation to other water quality parameters in the groundwater system of a major lead-zinc mine in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District of northern Idaho. It is known that mine wastes containing pyrite (FeS2) are capable of producing acid waters under oxidizing conditions, and the redox status of groundwater is an important factor in determining the degree of acid water formation and subsequent leaching of metals from mine tailings and ore bodies in this mining area. The results obtained from this study show that the relative concentrations of the arsenic redox pair are correlated with the quality of the mine waters studied and the ratio of As(V)/As(III) has the potential to be a redox indicator for groundwater systems. The river sediments of the South Fork and the Main Stem of the Coeur d'Alene River are contaminated with As, Sb, and other heavy metals from past mining activities. The distribution of As and Sb species in the river waters has been studied. Trivalent As(III) is the predominant form of arsenic in the South Fork and the Main Stem, whereas the unpolluted North Fork generally has a higher concentration of As(V). The major Sb species in the three branches of the river is Sb(V). Mobilization of sediment As and Sb during sediHent-water interactions has been investigated using laboratory leaching experiments. The releases of As and Sb are related to the free iron oxides and free manganese oxides of the sediments. The effects of the contaminated sediments on the water quality, with respect to As and Sb, of the creeks surrounding the Blackbird area in east-central Idaho have also been investigated. The pentavalent As(V) and Sb(V) are the major species observed in the creek waters. The field observations are consistent with the leaching experiments performed in the laboratory. The contaminated sediments are non-point sources of pollution which should be considered for water quality management planning of the mining areas studied.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_mok_1988,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,152
"Arsenate and sulfate reduction in the sediments of Coeur d'Alene Lake, Idaho","Harrington, James M.",1998-05,Lake Coeur d'Alene,"47.54, -116.82",heavy metals; mine wastes; sediment; water pollution,"Sediments of Lake Coeur d'Alene, Idaho (CDAL) have been extensively contaminated with iron and trace elements from mining activities in the Coeur d'Alene mining district. Previous surveys of (CDAL) sediment have suggested the majority of the metals are bound in an oxide phase, and if true, contaminated water may result if anoxic conditions occur in the water column. In contrast, data from this study indicate that the majority of the iron and trace elements are bound in a sulfidic phase. Examination of the sediment pore waters shows iron and trace element concentrations to be more than federal drinking water standards. Strongly reducing conditions and an abundant microbial community are also present, indicating that reactions that occur under reducing conditions are predominant in CDAL sediments. In particular, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are abundant in CDAL sediments. Isolates of native SRB have the ability to form sulfides from soluble metal. In such conditions, metal solubility is low. indicating that SRB may act to mitigate the effects of metal contamination in CDAL. Arsenic shows some different trends as compared with other trace elements. Arsenic solubility is highest in redox potential between the ferric to ferrous couple and the sulfate to sulfide couple. As (III) is not sorbed as well to sediment components, and hence formation of reduced forms of arsenic may encourage arsenic mobilization in anoxic sediments. Bacterial transformations of arsenic have recently been shown to occur in sediments. In this study, arsenic reducing organisms were found to be less abundant than SRB, but still numerous. Additions of soluble As (V) to sediment microcosms were reduced to As (III). This reduction was stimulated by organic acids, and was inhibited by a respiratory inhibitor of SRB. These results suggest that SRB can form metal sulfides, and also mobilize arsenic by creating a reduced mobile form.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_harrington_1998,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,153

A solvent extraction procedure using ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (APDC) as an extractant coupled with neutron activation analysis was chosen for arsenic and antimony speciation studies of interstitial waters in this work. The distributions of arsenic and antimony species in natural waters and in interstitial waters of the polluted sediments of the Coeur d'Alene River in northern Idaho were investigated. High concentrations of arsenic and high ratios of As(III)/As(V) were observed in the interstitial waters obtained from the sediments of the South Fork of the river. The As and Sb levels in the interstitial waters of the sediments collected from the Coeur d'Alene River were found to be proportional to the levels of these elements in the surface waters, indicating a correlation of pollutants between waters and sediments.

All four habitat types scored poor or marginal in substrate/available cover, pool variability, sediment deposition, and riparian zone width. Relative fish abundance as measured by CPUE at stabilized (RR and RR V) shorelines was consistently higher than at unstabilized (FB and V) shorelines among all seasons. Relative fish abundance was not significantly different between stabilized and unstabilized habitat types for gillnetting (F= 1. 9 5, P=0.167), but was significantly higher at stabilized than unstabilized habitats for electrofishing (F=5.66, P=0.020). Differences in species diversity were only evident between sections, not among habitat types or seasons. Fish community differences were apparent among habitat types as well as between sections and among seasons. Brown bullhead Ameirus nebulosus, northern pike Esox lucius, and pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus were captured in significantly higher numbers at stabilized than unstabilized sites and longnose suckers Catostomus catostomus were captured in greater numbers at unstabilized than stabilized sites. Water temperature and spawn timing influenced fish abundance and composition in spring. Large diameter riprap supported a higher abundance of fish than did smaller diameter riprap. Overall, stabilized shorelines on the lower Coeur d'Alene River were not found to be adversely affecting overall fish relative abundance, diversity, and species composition under the existing conditions of a low percentage of banks stabilized with riprap (2.5%). Instead, stabilized shorelines provided beneficial habitat in a river system with low quality and diversity of available habitats. This result should not be predicted, however, to apply as increasingly high percentages of the river bank are stabilized, and loss of river function occurs. Data from the above sampling were also analyzed to assess possible impact of piscivores (smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui, northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis, and northern pike) on native salmonids, especially Westslope cutthroat trout Oncoryhynchus clarki lewisi. The objectives were to 1) evaluate and quantify salmonid use of stabilized and unstabilized shoreline habitats by season and river section, 2) evaluate and quantify piscivorous species use of stabilized and unstabilized shoreline habitat by season and river section, and 3) determine if an overlap exists between salmonid and piscivore use of stabilized and unstabilized shoreline habitats by season and river section. In all, 81 salmonids were captured, or 2% of the total fish catch. Salmonid catch in the lower river was greatest during spring when water temperatures were low and juveniles were outmigrating to Lake Coeur d'Alene. No significant differences in salmonid catch were evident between stabilized and unstabilized habitats (x2=0.064, P=0.800), though juvenile wests lope cutthroat trout showed some affinity for stabilize areas with I 0 out of 12 individuals captured at these sites. In all, 670 piscivores were captured, or 19% of the total fish catch. Piscivore catch was significantly lower in spring, when salmonid numbers were highest, than in fall and summer, when salmonid numbers were lowest (x2=17.465, P&lt;O.OOl). Overall, piscivores were not captured in significantly different numbers at stabilized and unstabilized habitats (x2=0.243, P=0.622); however, northern pike (N=22) were captured in significantly higher numbers at stabilized habitats. The overall effects of habitat type on salmonid and piscivore overlap were not clear. Based on the data available, season seems more important than habitat in affecting salmonid and piscivore impacts. Specific studies are outlined that need to be conducted for a clearer understanding of the relation between salmonids and potential predation from piscivores in the lower river. In comparison of catches between the two gears (gillnetting and electro fishing), species composition (x2=831.46, P&lt;O.OO 1) and length selectivity (t=3 7 .86, P&lt;O.OO 1) were significantly different. Electro fishing captured a greater numbers of individuals (N=2,915) than gillnetting (N=596), but individuals were much smaller for electrofishing (mean length 96 mm) than for gillnetting (mean length 331 mm). Gillnets more readily captured longnose suckers and largescale suckers Catostomus macrocheilus (50% of total catch), whereas electro fishing captured larger numbers of yellow perch Perea flavescens and pumpkinseed (54% of total catch). The use of these two gears together provided a more representative sample of the fish community than either gear could have provided alone.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_gidley_2008,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,155

"Analysis of ground water quality and water level data and the effects of recharge on ground water quality at Smelterville Flats, Idaho","Swope, S. P.",1990-09,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; heavy metals; zinc; water quality; groundwater pollution,"The Smelterville Flats are located in the Coeur D'Alene River Valley in Northern Idaho. Mine wastes from zinc, silver and lead mines were discharged into the river and have been deposited in thicknesses up to seven feet over a large area of the Flats causing significant water quality degradation in the underlying aquifer. Water levels and water quality were monitored in ten pairs of piezometers (10 shallow and 10 deep) through two spring recharge events to study the effects of hydrology on water quality. Heavy metal concentrations measured in the shallow wells were consistently higher than those measured in the deep wells. Despite a significant difference in water quality between the shallow and deep sets of piezometers, dissolved constituents change congruently in the deep and shallow piezometers. Zinc concentrations in the shallow wells varied widely across the Flats. Zinc concentrations could be correlated with depth in the deep piezometers implying the existence of a downward concentration gradient away from the wastes above the aquifer. A linear relation between zinc and cadmium concentrations and to a lesser extent between zinc and lead concentrations supports the use of zinc as an indicator of contamination by the mine waste. While overall zinc concentration correlates positively with electrical conductivity collectively, well by well correlation is not consistent. Zinc concentration correlates negatively with pH in the deep wells but this correlation is not conclusive in the shallow wells. Variations in zinc concentrations are associated with antecedent precipitation and therefore recharge more than with water level rise. Therefore remediation efforts should focus on decreasing recharge. A conceptual model of heavy metal influx has been established consisting of three stratigraphic layers. Infiltrating ground water passes through the first layer and dissolves heavy metal ions. The heavy metal bearing water then moves downward through the second layer and mixes with horizontally migrating ground water of lower zinc concentration in the third layer. Some of this water eventually enters the South Fork of the Coeur D'Alene River.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_swope_1990,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,157
"The effects of simulated dredging and flooding on the trace-element rich sediments in Lake Coeur d'Alene and the Coeur d'Alene River, Idaho","La Force, Matthew J.",1996-12,Lake Coeur d'Alene; Coeur d'Alene River,"47.54, -116.82; 47.51, -116.15",dredging; sediment; heavy metals; water pollution treatment,"Lake Coeur d' Alene (Lake CDA) and both Main Stem (MSCDR) and South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River (SFCDR) are contaminated with heavy metals from numerous years of mining. Possible environmental management plans in the region may include dredging and bank stability projects. Two different studies were initiated to look at potential contaminant release from proposed dredging of Lake CDA and from natural flooding events in the MSCDR and SFCDR. In the first study, an ex-situ experiment was conducted to determine how dredging releases heavy metals from contaminated lake sediments. The procedure used is as follows: 1) pore water total metal concentration, 2) total metal abundance in the organic, amorphous, crystalline and sulfidic fractions of the solid phase, 3) simulated dredging while measuring pH, Eh, and contaminant release over time, and 4) comparison of experimental data with results predicted from the MINTEQA2 speciation program. To simulate dredging operations, cores taken by gravity drilling were placed into a reaction vessel and mixed while being oxygenated for 800 hours. During the 800 h, solution As and Pb concentrations were found to be higher (0.0838 and 0.57 ppm, respectively) than the maximum contaminant levels allowed for drinking water and therefore would be detrimental to water quality within the lake. Zinc contaminant levels are of concern because they remain consistently high throughout the dredging simulation (8.3 ppm). The sediments remaining from the two dredging trials were also analyzed by selective dissolution analysis; partitioning of contaminants after dredging shifted from the organic fraction to the amorphous and crystalline metal-oxide fraction. The results suggest that management efforts that include dredging could have short-term impact on water quality in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. An environmental remediation plan is necessary to control the release of heavy metals as flooding occurs in this region. In order to address the environmental ramifications of flooding, water quality in the river system was assessed, contaminates in the riverbank sediments were geochemically phase partitioned, and their release were measured under simulated laboratory flooding experiments. To simulate flooding experiments, 18 columns were constructed allowing the sediment-water interface to be monitored for pH, Eh and dissolved concentrations of As, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn. These columns were subjected to two flooding events. The first event involved the addition of N2(g) and 0 2(g&gt; purged river water to the columns and the second event also had a nutrient source (D-glucose) added to the solution in the columns. During the first event Zn was released at an average concentration of 10.41 mg/L into solution from sediment taken along the MSCDR at Cataldo, ID. For the second event, nutrient loading stimulated microbial activity which in turn increased contaminant levels drastically at all three sites; mean values of trace element contaminants from the three sites are As= 1.54, Pb = 7.57, and Zn = 79.29 mg/L. The release of contaminates due to flooding is degrading water quality in the river system and proving to be extremely detrimental to the aquatic biota. Results indicate that sediments currently situated in the riverbanks are releasing contaminants into the river system as flooding occurs and a remediation plan is necessary to eliminate this problem. In particular, extreme precaution must be used in the region to limit nutrient additions into the river system.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_laforce_1996,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,158

Comparative physiological studies illustrate that Desulfitobacterium hafniense and Desulfitobacterium frappieri, known for reductively dechlorinating chlorophenols, are also capable of toxic metal(loid) respiration. DNA:DNA hybridization and comparative physiological studies suggest that D. hafniense D. frappieri, and strain GBFH should be united into one species.

Characterization of the upper aquifer beneath Smelterville Flats with implications for mitigation of groundwater contamination,"Kunkel, Douglas",1993-11,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; water quality; groundwater pollution,"In the early part of this century, the Smelterville Flats area near Kellogg, Idaho received mining, milling, and metallurgical wastes. Mine wastes were deposited on the flood plain or in the channel of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. In the early 1900s, a series of dams were built across the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River at the western end of Smelterville Flats in an attempt to control the downstream transport of mine wastes. Mine wastes and other sediments were deposited behind this dam. The site, known as Smelterville Flats, is the largest uncontrolled deposit of mining wastes that remains in the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River Valley. Water levels and water quality samples were collected from existing monitoring wells within the Smelterville Flats study area. A more intensive study was conducted on a small sub-area of the Smelterville Flats study area known as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) sub-area. Ten sets of piezometers were installed to monitor water quality and water levels in the upper aquifer beneath Smelterville Flats in the BLM sub-area. A pumping well and observation wells were installed in the BLM sub-area in order to conduct a pumping test in the upper aquifer to determine aquifer coefficients. Ground water level gradients in the study area indicate that the ground water flow direction is from east to west, following the general gradient of the valley of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. Water levels also indicate that the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River is a losing stream in the east end of the study area and a gaining stream in the west end of the study area. Shallower monitoring wells in the upper aquifer within the BLM sub-area consistently had higher concentration of ions associated with mining wastes than deeper monitoring wells installed in the same aquifer at the same location. Oxidation of the mine wastes may occur in the unsaturated zone in the presence of oxygen, or in the presence of oxygen and water if the film of water is thin enough to allow the diffusion of oxygen to the reaction sites. The thin layer of water surrounding the wastes may become a concentrated solution of soluble reaction products. Infiltration of precipitation, and rises in ground water levels flush and transport the soluble reaction products from the reaction sites on the wastes into the shallow ground water system. The oxidation products are removed from the reaction sites, thereby producing fresh reaction sites for the next influx of oxygen. The reaction products may then be transported by the ground water flow system, which ultimately discharges to the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River at the western end of Smelterville Flats. Based on the data collected, potential mitigative measures were evaluated and analyzed in order to minimize the adverse long-term effects of mine waste on the ground water and surface water systems. Potential mitigative measures that are evaluated include treatment of the shallow aquifer water, elimination or reduction of ground water flow through the shallow aquifer, removal of the major sources of metal ions, and no action. The continuation of research to identify or develop a mechanism to extract marketable metals from the wastes on Smelterville Flats appears to constitute the most appropriate course of action.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_kunkel_1993,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,160
"Hydrogeological characterization of dredge materials and fluvially deposited tailings at Cataldo Mission Flats Coeur d'Alene River, Idaho","Gill, Steve W.",2003-05,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.56, -116.38",dredging; sediment; heavy metals; hydrogeology,"The hydrogeologic system in the vicinity of the Cataldo Mission Flats, Kootenai County, Idaho, on the Coeur d'Alene River was investigated during the period June 1997 through March 1998. Along this reach, cadmium, lead, and zinc concentrations in soil and pore water are known to be elevated as a result of historic mining activity within the Coeur d'Alene watershed. In order to identify sources of heavy metals release to the river, a conceptual hydrogeological model and metals loading analyses were completed along the subject reach. Based on the results of the hydrogeologic investigation completed at 23 groundwater and 16 surface water sites, the dredge materials constitute a perched water table system that show little, if any, connection to the Coeur d'Alene River. Based on the results of an approximate loading analysis (using USGS gaged flows and water sampling) on six sections along the reach, no significant increases or decreases in dissolved cadmium, lead, or zinc loadings were identified. These results indicate that no significant inflows of impacted groundwater containing high levels of heavy metals can be identified along the Cataldo Mission Flats reach. From a remedial perspective, this suggests that large-scale excavation of the dredged materials along this reach is not necessary and that attention should be focused on remediation and stabilization of impacted and erodible material, which has the potential to be suspended during high flow times. Based on these results, it is recommended that in areas where erodible and impacted dredged materials have been identified, which are not well vegetated, these materials should be stabilized by armoring or using heavy metals-tolerant vegetation. Where a riparian environment is established over impacted dredge materials, these bank areas should be stabilized so as to promote continual development of the riparian zone and minimize resuspension of the sediments and destruction of the riparian zone during high flow events. An additional recommendation is that a similar multi-location loading study of dissolved and suspended metals be repeated during high flow when bank sediments are being resuspended by erosion to identify specific locations of sediment loading.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_gill_2003,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,161

Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Smelterville Flats lies within the Bunker Hill Superfund Site which is located along the South Fork of the Coeur d' Alene River in northern Idaho. The Flats have been the repository of over 100 years of uncontrolled mine waste dumping. These mine wastes degrade the shallow ground water and are being studied to evaluate possible mitigative measures. Natural recharge events such as spring snowmelt or locally intense rain storms are observed to influence temporal fluctuations in ground water quality and ground water levels observed at the BLM site. These recharge events must be considered in light of the metals content of the mine waste, the local fluvial sediment stratigraphy, and the local infiltration history. These factors control the residence time of any particular pulse of infiltrating moisture within the mine wastes and governs the impact of this infiltration on ground water quality and ground water levels. Three months of artificial recharge conducted on the BLM site made no observable impact on measured ground water levels or ground water chemistry. The spatial patterns of ground water quality in this study area are controlled by the geology, hydraulic conductivity, and metals content of mine waste in the neighborhood of the piezometer, as well as the local sedimentary stratigraphy. Poor quality shallow ground water samples can be associated with flotation slimes containing relatively high amounts of metals and having a relatively low hydraulic conductivity. The mine wastes can be separated physically, statistically, and geochemically into jig tailings and flotation slimes. The jig tailings are oxidized in appearance, sandy, and typically contain about one-half the zinc content of the flotation slimes. The flotation slimes appear black to dark gray, and are composed of silt to claysized particles. The spatial distribution of the mine wastes within the BLM portion of Smelterville Flats is controlled by fluvial and lacustrine depositional environments, by the morphology of the pre-mining fluvial plain, by the production histories of the mine and mill wastes, and by subsequent surficial weathering and fluvial reworking. Consideration of the impact of natural recharge events should be included in the design of extractive mitigative efforts at Smelterville Flats. Intense rainstorms or rapid snowmelt events commonly occur at Smelterville Flats.

The published literature indicates that mining practices in the district historically have had a significant impact on the environment. Past practices have left extensive deposits of old tailings which have been reworked by man and streams, especially in the valley of the south fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. These old tailings as well as tailings from some present operations represent a potential source of pollution for ground water. In order to gain greater insight into this potential source, the distribution of alluvium, tailings, and mixed tailings and alluvium was mapped using air photos and field observations. Seismic refraction and electrical resistivity depth soundings were utilized to interpret the thickness of the valley floor fill, which constitutes the aquifer supplying many of the wells in the area. A water-table map was prepared from water-level measurements at 88 locations. Ground-water was sampled at 49 locations, and the samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, calcium, cadmium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, lead, antimony, and zinc. The valley fill was found to thicken westward from 30 feet near Wallace to 414 feet near Rose Lake. The water-table map indicates that the main stem of the Coeur d'Alene River is gaining water from the groundwater system. Additional water-level measurements are needed east of Kingston before it can be determined whether the south fork is gaining or losing. High heavy-metal concentrations in the valley of the south fork can be correlated with geochemical anomalies, jig tailings deposits, tailings ponds, and metal processing plants.

The source and character of recharge to the aquifer may be significant constraints on the future development of the Rathdrum Prairie. The ground water system in the southern portion of the Rathdrum Prairie in Idaho was investigated to determine the characteristics and magnitude of recharge to the glacial aquifer from the Spokane River in the reach between Lake Coeur d'Alene to Post Falls. Particular emphasis was placed upon the occurrence of zinc in the flow regime, originating from long term mining activities in the Coeur d'Alene-Spokane River drainage. The study, conducted in the summer of 1975, included measurements of water levels in wells and collection of samples for quality analysis. The configuration of the water table near the Spokane River indicates recharge through the channel bottom. The hydrogeologic conditions of the glacial aquifer indicate an average hydraulic conductivity of 10,000 gallons per day per square foot. Results of the study show that fine grained channel sediments largely control the magnitude of recharge through the channel bottom. The rate of ground water recharge from the Spokane River above Post Falls in estimated to be 230 cubic feet per second (cfs) an important indication of ground water movement and recharge characteristics.

"Beneficial use attainability assessments of streams in the Lake Coeur d'Alene Basin, Idaho","Hartz, M.",1993-01,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.49",watershed protection; watershed management; rehabilitation; water quality,"Protection and restoration of water bodies within the Lake Coeur d'Alene basin in northern Idaho, are two primary goals of the Coeur d'Alene Basin Restoration Project. The Project provides a mechanism for the coordination of various programs and activities designed to achieve these goals. The Coeur d'Alene Basin Restoration Project Framework is a roadmap for environmental protection and restoration of the basin. A task outlined in the framework, is the identification of attainable uses of stream segments in the basin. This task is the primary objective of this study. Recovery of beneficial uses of water bodies impacted by past land use activities is best assessed by in-stream water quality monitoring with results compared to specific water quality criteria. The beneficial uses of any given water body determine a set of water quality criteria necessary to support those beneficial uses. For this reason, beneficial use attainability assessments were conducted on a wide range of stream segments in the basin. Other objectives of the Coeur d'Alene Basin use attainability analysis are to: refine existing chemical water quality criteria and determine physical habitat and biological criteria necessary to support specific beneficial uses; and assess the status of beneficial uses of waters in the basin. Essentially, beneficial support status as determined by the current study provides a qualitative indication of the current support level of uses deemed attainable for a given waterbody; refined water quality criteria quantitatively identify the desired future condition necessary to achieve full support of beneficial uses. Future monitoring of beneficial use recovery will utilize quanitiative water quality criteria to gauge restoration success. In meeting the study objectives, this study reviewed beneficial use designations currently incorporated in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. A total of 21 streams have use designations in the Lake Coeur d'Alene basin, of which 11 were verified. This study identifies the need to revise the remaining use designations to accurately reflect the actual attainable and existing uses. An additional 155 streams in the basin were assigned beneficial use classifications based on a structured scientific approach set forth in Idaho's standard use attainability protocol. This study documents the attainable and existing beneficial uses for a wide range of water bodies in the Lake Coeur d'Alene basin based on background information provided by cooperating agencies and field verification results from the IDEO 1992 field surveys. In addition, the status of beneficial uses (full support, partial support or non-support) in the basin is assessed. The information generated in the study provides the impetus for anticipated revisions and inclusions of use designations in the Idaho Water Quality Standards, which are necessary for protection and restoration of water quality in the basin. The study results also provide background information necessary for subsequent monitoring of remediation project effectiveness on water quality impaired segments in the basin.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,"Idaho Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality",University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_hartz_1993,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,169

Laboratory experiments show zinc, copper, and lead contaminated ground water produce induced polarization and/or resistivity anomalies. Field testing at Smelterville Flats, Cataldo Flats, and Bunker Hill Flats East Tailings Pond in the Coeur d'Alene River Drainage in Northern Idaho demonstrates usefulness of the technique in field studies. The field sites are contaminated by controlled, uncontrolled, and abandoned mineral resource wastes, jig and flotation tailings. IP response is different in coarse sediments and wastes, clay sized wastes, and clay sized natural sediments; furthermore, IP and resistivity responses are affected by man made debris and saturation variations. The geologic complexity of the river deposited wastes and sediments has confounded many investigations at the Smelterville Flats site.

"Land management and flood effects on the distribution and abundance of cutthroat trout in the Coeur d'Alene River Basin, Idaho","Abbott, Ann M.",2000-12,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",trout; flood damage;,"In January 1996, the largest flood since 1974 occurred in the Coeur d'Alene River basin, Idaho. In some areas the flood peaks were the second highest ever recorded and exceeded flows that have a 1% chance of occurring during any given year. The focus of this study was to expand the understanding of the influence of biological and physical processes and landscape patterns at the scale of watersheds and subbasins on the distribution, abundance and persistence of westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi. During the summer of 1996, I sampled 62 second and third order tributaries within the Coeur d'Alene River basin using a stratified random sampling design. Streams were divided into three reaches of equal length, and three sites within each reach were randomly chosen for single pass electrofishing. One of the nine sites in each stream was randomly selected for an estimate of absolute abundance using multiple pass electrofishing. Capture efficiency was estimated from the multiple pass sites using a maximum likelihood estimator. Mean capture efficiency was 68% and ranged from 23 to 100%. Single pass catches were adjusted using the average capture efficiency for the basin, and the adjusted catches were used to compute density estimates for all streams. All streams sampled contained westslope cutthroat trout, suggesting that local extinctions did not occur following the January 1996 flood. The mean stream density in 1996 for the entire basin was 0.057 fishlm2 and ranged from 0.001 to 0.219 fish. Estimated densities were highest in tributaries to the Main Coeur d'Alene River ( x = 0.083 ), followed by tributaries to the Upper Coeur d'Alene River ( x = 0.048 ), tributaries to Shoshone Creek ( x = 0.067) and tributaries to the North Fork Coeur d'Alene river ( x = 0.039 ). Mean densities for the Main Coeur d'Alene and North Fork Coeur d'Alene subbasins were not significantly different in 1996 than 1995 (p = 0.868 and p = 0.271 ). Mean densities in both the Upper Coeur d'Alene and Shoshone Creek subbasins were significantly lower in 1996 than 1995 (p = 0.063 and p = 0.008), but these differences can be accounted for by three streams in the Upper Coeur d'Alene drainage and one stream in the Shoshone Creek drainage. Densities in the North Fork Coeur d'Alene were nearly significantly different from densities in the Main Coeur d'Alene (p = 0.090) and Shoshone Creek (p = 0.1 08) in 1996, however, no other drainages showed significant differences in densities in 1996. Age-0 cutthroat trout were not found in any streams with wetted widths wider than 8 m. Logistic regression was used to model the probability of encountering cutthroat trout fry, and the best model used gradient to predict the probability of encountering age-0 cutthroat trout (p = 0.0005). Estimated density of westslope cutthroat trout was significantly related to large woody debris counts per 1000 m of channel, and cumulative equivalent clearcut acreage (R2 = 0.505, p = 0.004). Densities decreased with increased wetted width, increased with increased large woody debris count, and decreased with increased cumulative equivalent clearcut acreage. My results showed that cutthroat trout densities are better predicted by variables measured at the stream or watershed level than at the site or habitat type level. Cutthroat trout in the Coeur d'Alene River basin were able to persist following significant disturbance including disturbance due to land management activities, disturbance due to severe flooding, and the cumulative effects of both.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_abbott_2000,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,171

Recent environmental studies have generally demonstrated an improved condition in the Coeur d'Alene River, lateral lakes, and downstream Lake Coeur d' Alene since the early monitoring. We sampled largemouth bass (Hicropterus salmoides), northern pike (Esox lucius), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus), and yellow perch (Perea flavescens) from Killarney Lake, a lateral lake on the Coeur d' Alene River in northern Idaho and analyzed edible flesh for concentrations of zinc, lead, mercury, cadmium, copper, and arsenic. Mean concentrations (n=lO) of zinc were highest in yellow perch (4.79 mg/kg -wet weight) and lowest in brown bullheads (2.95 mg/kg), considerably lower than the 45 mg/kg action level from the literature. Mean concentrations (n=10) of copper ranged from 0.265 mg/kg in black crappie to 0.31 mg/kg in yellow perch, northern pike and largemouth bass, also well below the recommended action level of 20 mg/kg. Mean concentrations (nlO) of lead ranged from 0.014 mgjkg in largemouth bass to 0.183 mg/kg in brown bullheads, compared to the 3.50 mg/kg action level. Mean concentrations (n10) of cadmium ranged from 0.018 to 0.04 mg/kg, highest in brown bullheads and lowest in northern pike. Action levels listed in the literature for cadmium were 0.07 mg/kg. Mean mercury concentrations ranged from 0.034 mg/kg in brown bullheads to 0.093 mg/kg in yellow perch, also less than the 1 mg/kg action level. Concentrations of arsenic were generally below detection limits (&lt;0.04 mg/kg) for all species but varied considerably between two laboratories which conducted analysis on replicate tissue samples. Comparisons of all species of fishes with the metals tested resulted in significant increases in body content as a function of size in largemouth bass for copper and mercury in yellow perch and zinc in black crappie. Comparisons of fish flesh content with allowable human intakes resulted in estimation of a maximum allowable consumption of 3.1 kg/week of fish from Killarney lake. Tolerance limits calculated for the various flesh concentrations of metals indicated that we were 99% confident that 99% of the populations were at or below action levels for the species sampled for zinc, copper, and lead. Tolerance limits for cadmium in yellow perch and brown bullheads exceeded the recommended action limits, while those in northern pike and black crappie were at the action level. Based on our sample results from 10 fish, additional sampling is needed to adequately describe the distribution of lead in brown bullheads (N  50) and yellow perch (N  26) from Killarney lake. Differences in detection limits of heavy metals, differences in concentrations from the same fillet from two laboratories, and between-site variation all suggest a cautious approach to the interpretation of heavy metal analysis data from surface waters.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Bureau of Land Management; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_bennett_1990,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,172
Reclamation plans for abandoned mill tailing impoundments in the South Fork Coeur d'Alene River Basin,"Gross, Michael Robert",1982-04,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",water pollution; mine wastes; heavy metals; groundwater pollution,"Water pollution resulting from nearly a hundred years of continuous mining activity along the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River continues to be a problem. Although recent efforts by local mining companies and government agencies have greatly reduced contaminant levels in streams throughout the valley, a perennial source of ''background'' pollution remains which is not associated with currently active mining operations. This report presents the results of a study of potential water quality problems from abandoned flotation tailing impoundments and offers specific reclamation plans designed to minimize water quality degradation. A summary of current reclamation technology is presented, followed by field studies of three abandoned impoundment sites. An inventory of all abandoned tailing impoundments in the South Fork basin was conducted. Based on the field studies and inventory of all sites, a number of factors important in site abandonment were identified and categorized as either physical, chemical, or esthetic. Classification of each site with respect to the identified factors was then possible. A general reclamation plan was drafted which deals with each of the identified factors important in site abandonment. Application of the general reclamation plan to each of the sites listed in the abandoned impoundment inventory ends the report. It is concluded that the major problems posed by the abandoned tailing impoundments are physical rather than chemical. Movement of fine-grained tailing material directly into the surface streams appears to be a more serious problem than chemical leaching of heavy metal ions from the abandoned tailing impoundments into ground water flow systems.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_gross_1982,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,173

Characterization of deoximorphic features in mine waste-contaminated wetlands soils,"Hickey, P.",2006-04,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.51, -116.15",heavy metals; groundwater contamination; speciation; mineralogy,"Metal contamination from Northern Idaho mining operations has impacted wetlands along the Coeur d'Alene River floodplains resulting in a potentially hazardous environment for humans and animals. Contamination in these areas is often reported as total contaminant concentration per mass of soil, and assumes that the contaminants are homogenously distributed throughout the soil. However, pedogenesis causes distinct secondary mineral redistribution within soil profiles, and leads to selective partitioning of contaminants within the profile at macro (em) to sub-micron scales. This study examined the variability of redoximorphic features within a wetland, and contaminant enrichment in redoximorphic features relative to landscape position and water table height. Six distinct categories of Fe and Fe/Mn-rich cemented redoximorphic features were identified. The Fe and Fe/Mn-cemented redox features were found to have Cd and Pb concentrations up to four and six times greater in magnitude than soil averages. Iron and Fe/Mn-cemented redox features also had elevated levels of As and Zn. The Fe/Mn-cemented aggregates had the highest Mn concentrations (approximately 3.4ï¿½/o), were most common in the 1-2 mm size fraction, and contained the highest concentration of Pb (approximately 2.6ï¿½/o). Iron-cemented root channel linings and Fe-cemented aggregates had comparable concentrations of As, Cd, Mn, Pb, and S. Coarse sand aggregates and Fe/Mn-cemented aggregates had similar concentrations of Cd, Mn, P, and Zn. Iron-cemented aggregates and cemented root channel linings had physical similarities, while coarse sand aggregates and Fe/Mn-cemented aggregates also appeared similar. The Fe and Fe/Mn-cemented redox features were found primarily in the top 15 em of soil and decreased with soil depth. Results from this study show that pedogenesis in Coeur d'Alene wetland soils results in distinct redoximorphic features and non-homogeneous metal concentrations. Among these features are Fe and Mn - cemented aggregates that range in size from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. These aggregates have unique mineralogy and concentrate metals within the soils. Understanding contaminant partitioning and speciation in soils will allow for improved management and risk assessment of the contaminated soils.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_hickey_2006,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,175

In the early days, jig tailings containing sphalerite and other heavy metal sulfides were discharged directly into the South Fork Coeur D' Alene River resulting in the elimination of aquatic life. Over the past 20 years, water quality legislation and modern milling techniques have combined to reduce sediment load and eliminate point source pollution from mine and mill sites, thereby improving the water quality along the South Fork. However, ''background'' levels of metals continue to pose problems for aquatic life in the river. This project recorded 18 sampling stations along the South Fork and Main Stem of the Coeur D' Alene River over a six month period; these values are compared to the metal concentrations reported in historic data collected by Mink (1969) and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) (1972-1984). The sampling station at Cataldo on the Main Stem and the stations upstream of Wallace on the South Fork did not exhibit excessive concentrations of the elements analyzed. Zinc displayed the highest overall concentrations during the study period; it exceeded toxicity limits for the survival of aquatic life. Station 12, located downstream of Smelterville Flats, exhibited the highest consistent concentration of zinc along the river. The highest zinc concentrations of all occurred in March from overland runoff through tailings, from the smelter dust on the land surface mixed with runoff, from the Smelterville Flats aquifer, and in July from ground water inflow. May displayed the lowest overall zinc concentration during the sampling period. Past EPA studies indicate that cadmium and lead, although declining in concentration, still exceed EPA toxicity limits for the survival of fish along the South Fork. Since 1980, zinc levels at Smelterville Flats exceeded EPA's standard drinking levels. Although still above chronic levels for aquatic life, zinc concentrations are on the decline. Zinc levels at Cataldo have declined steadily since 1976 and have not exceeded drinking standard limits. The 1988 data compared to Mink's data from 1969 at Cataldo on the Main Stem indicate somewhat of a decrease in zinc concentrations. Station 12 at Smelterville Flats is variable for 1969 and 1988; but the majority of the 1988 zinc concentrations are lower than Mink's data, particularly during July and August. EPA bioassays conducted in 1986 record a number of benthic insect species living along the South Fork; a good return of game fish downstream of the South Fork confluence has been detected in the Main Stem of the Coeur D' Alene River.

Water samples collected from 34 stations on the Coeur d'Alene River system over a sixteen-month period indicate zinc and cadmium concentrations above toxic limits for fish survival over much of the South Fork and Main Stem; with the exception of fluoride which is high at two stations during low flow, concentrations of most other elements are comparable to or slightly greater than concentrations observed in the North Fork. The water quality data indicate one major source for zinc, cadmium, and fluoride and one less easily identifiable source. High river stage also increases total mass of zinc transported in solution, which suggests a source during high flow in addition to present day mine waste disposal operations. Elimination of the high zinc and cadmium concentrations is considered to be essential to the complete recovery of the river. Basin-wide installation of settling ponds for mill wastes (not for all industrial wastes) by December 1968 has greatly improved the quality of water, particularly with respect to suspended solids. As a result, macrobenthic fauna recently have been discovered in the South Fork and a greater number of species found in the Main Stem, which indicate that the river is beginning to recover. Raw sewage, discharged into the South Fork throughout its reach, is the source of a complex pollution problem.

Current mining practices are monitored and regulated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that present mining activities are within the regulations. Mine wastes or tailings were deposited on the flood plain or in the channel of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. These mine wastes were carried downstream, mixing with the native alluvial material and forming large deposits. In the early 19oo's, a series of dams were constructed across the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River in an attempt to control the downstream movement of the mine waste. As the South Fork entered the Smelterville Flats study area, located one mile west of Kellogg, Idaho, the coarser sediments were deposited first. The finer materials were deposited in the backwaters of a dam located at the western end of the Flats. These tailings have high concentrations of zinc, lead, iron, and many other metals. Water movement through these tailings leaches the heavy metals into solution where they are able to enter the water resource system. Piezometers were installed to monitor the water quality and for water levels measurements. Soil pits were constructed to determine the depth of mine waste and its physical and chemical properties. The effect on the water quality of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River by ground water in the Smelterville Flats study area is minimal. Based on the data collected, potential reclamation procedures were developed to minimize the long-term effect of the abandoned mine waste on the water resource system. Potential reclamation procedures include removal of the mine waste, fluctuation of the ground water level, or, do nothing at all.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_norton_1980,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,183
"Point and nonpoint source contributions of trace heavy metals to the South Fork Coeur d'Alene River, Shoshone County, Idaho 1989-1990. Water quality status report no. 111","Hartz, Mike",1993,Coeur d'Alene River,"47.51, -116.15",heavy metals; water pollution; mine wastes;,"This study was designed and implemented in an effort to determine the appropriateness of the 304 (I) listing of South Fork Coeur d'Alene River segment PB-130S. Section 304 (I) of the Water Quality Act of 1987 requires each state to list all stream segments that receive point source discharges of toxic pollutants and do not support appropriate beneficial uses even after effluent limitations are in place. In 1989 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provided funding to the Idaho Division of Environmental Quality to assess the water quality and biotic integrity of the South Fork near Mullan, Idaho in Shoshone County. Water quality information was collected during the 1990 water year. The water chemistry and biological data were used to determine the support status of the beneficial uses and the relevance of the segment boundary listed in Idaho Water Quality Standards. Specific objectives of this study include the following: 1) determine point source and nonpoint source heavy metals contributions to the South Fork above the Morning District bridge near Mullan, Idaho; 2) determine the effect of heavy metals on aquatic life uses in the study reach; and 3) determine the relevance of the stream segment boundary between stream segments PB-130s and PB-140s. Metals loading to the South Fork above Mullan, Idaho was modest compared to other reaches within the drainage, as estimated by the 1989-1990 data. Nonpoint source additions were the primary source of heavy metals to the river above Mullan. Between 1989 and 1990 treated waste water from Hecla's Lucky Friday mining operation generally contributed less than 3.0 % of the cadmium, copper and zinc load in the river. Lead contribution to the river from Hecla discharges were generally less than 9%, although low flow total lead contribution from pond 001 was estimated at 42% of the load at the lowest river station. Fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities were assessed at all the river stations in the study area. Macroinvertebrate data analysis does not conclusively indicate impairment of the use at the sampling stations from point source additions. Fisheries data was insufficient to determine the effect of point source metals discharges on fish communities at the sampling sites. Due to equipment failures, proper fish collection procedures were not followed therefore, comparisons of population estimates between each sample station were unavailable. However, qualitative analysis of fisheries information do not suggest substantial differences in beneficial use support status throughout the study reach. Impairment of beneficial uses and/or water chemistry of a waterbody attributed to point source pollution discharges, should be demonstrated in order to warrant 304 (I) listing. The data do not support the 304 (I) listing of segment PB-130s since impairment of cold water biota is not apparent. In addition, water quality data indicate point source contributions of metals to the river in PB-130s are minor compared to nonpoint sources. Toxicological effects of metals on aquatic organisms (if any) in segment PB-130s cannot be attributed to point source additions within the scope of the current study design. The information generated in this study was also used to evaluate the appropriateness of the segment boundary location between segments PB-140S and PB-130s. The designated beneficial uses of segment PB-140s (lowermost) differ from the range of uses designated for segment PB-130S. The existence of such a boundary implies beneficial uses change and therefor water quality management changes at a given boundary. However, the observed appropriate beneficial uses do not change throughout the length of the study reach. The beneficial use of cold water biota and salmonid spawning are existing and attainable everywhere in the study reach. These data do not support placement of a segment boundary anywhere within the current study site. Reliable toxics criteria for cold water biota in the study site apparently are not available. This study documents exceedance of current chronic lead and zinc criteria without any observed effect, attributable to elevated metals concentration, on aquatic biota. This issue can be resolved through development of site specific criteria applicable to waters in the study area. Accurate site specific criteria should subsequently be applied to effluent limitations in order to protect aquatic life uses in the river.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,"Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality","Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality",University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_ideqhartz_1993,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,184

"Potential for acid formation from tailings from the Coeur d'Alene mining area, Idaho","Martin, Lawrence James",1981-05,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; heavy metals; water pollution,Tailings disposal in the steep narrow canyons of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River has long been a problem for the mining companies of the Coeur d'Alene mining area. Pyrite (FeS2) in the tailings can be oxidized to form sulfuric acid and ferric hydroxide. The rate determining set in this process is the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron. Carbonates in the tailings can neutralize the acid formed by pyrite oxidation. Tailings from six active mines were collected for analysis of mineralogy and potential for acid formation. Samples from one of the active mines were found to be acid producing. Tailings that do not produce acid could be disposed by backfilling selected areas of the valley. Additional reclamation would have to take place to reduce the potential for erosion by the river. Acid-producing tailings could be disposed in a similar manner if safeguards to reduce or prevent acid formation are used.,Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_martin_1981,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,187
Hydrogeologic analysis of an abandoned tailings pile,"Morilla, Albert Garcia",1975-05,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; heavy metals; water pollution,"Several tailings ponds have recently been filled and abandoned in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District in northern Idaho. The abandonment of mine tailings piles may have detrimental effects on the water resource system in the immediate area by leaching of metals from the movement of precipitation through the pile material. This report presents the results of a study by the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology and the University of Idaho College of Mines, in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Mines, on the hydrogeologic factors that control the movement of ground-water through the abandoned Page tailings pile in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District in northern Idaho. A data collection network was installed to collect data on ground water flow systems and ground-water quality in and surrounding the pile. Analysis of water level data showed the existence of a ground-water mound under the east portion of the tailings pile. The flow system in the pile is dynamic and responds both to precipitation events and to periods of no recharge. A finite element steady-state mathematical model was constructed to help interpret the ground-water flow system in the Page pile. A sampling and testing program of the pile provided information on values of hydraulic conductivity. These data were incorporated as input to the mathematical model. Operation of the model showed that the location and fluctuations of the regional ground-water table and the quantity of recharge to the tailings pile from precipitation were the primary controlling factors for the location and height of the ground-water mound under the east side of the pile. The rate of discharge of subsurface water from the pile was estimated from model operation to be about 2000 gallons per day per acre. This rate of discharge along with water quality data from the tailings pile showed that zinc reaches the immediate area outside the pile at a rate of about 17.8 pounds per day equal to about 0.1 percent of the total daily quantity of zinc carried by the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River at Smelterville during low flow.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_morilla_1975,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,188

Trace metals in soils of the Coeur d'Alene River Valley and their potential effects on water quality,"Keely Jr., Joseph F.",1979-09,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",mine wastes; heavy metals; sediment contamination;,Soils in the Coeur d'Alene River Valley(s) have become contaminated with trace metals. Studies presented here show that the degree of contamination in these soils is dependent on distance from the local mining industry's smelting complex in the South Fork Coeur d'Alene River Valley and on river deposited mine wastes in the Main Stem Coeur d'Alene River Valley. Controlled greenhouse studies of garden vegetables and crops grown in trace metal contaminated soils from this locale suggest that most species suffer adverse growth effects and that all species accumulate the trace metals. A rapid decrease of trace metal concentrations in soils with increasing depth in the South Fork Coeur d'Alene River Valley indicates that these soils have become contaminated primarily as a result of atmospheric fallout/washout of smelter emissions. Under laboratory conditions the solubilization of these contaminants generally appears to have a linear relationship with time and rapidly reach equilibrium concentrations which are dependent on the pH of the soil solution and relative soil characteristics. Due to the high solubilities of the oxidation weathering products of the trace metal emissions and the river deposited mine wastes potentially high concentrations of trace metals can be rapidly leached from the contaminated soils by rainfall and high stage water tables.,Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_keely_1979,Copyright to this item is held by the author.

Metal(loid) cycling in mine-impacted sediments of the northern Idaho Coeur d'Alene River Basin,"Toevs, Gordon R.",2006-08,Coeur d'Alene Basin,"47.52, -116.56",heavy metals; water pollution; mine wastes;,"Mining activity along the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene (CDA) River in northern Idaho has resulted in mine tailings enriched in Pb, As, Ag, Sb, Hg, Cd, and Zn that have contaminated broad areas of the CDA River floodplain andLake CDA. Without a clear understanding of contaminant redistribution, tailings transport, and metal cycling within this region, sound management decisions to protect environmental quality are difficult. Our objective was to better define the biogeochemical reactions controlling toxic metal cycling within sediments of Lake CDA and wetlands in the Basin. Sediment from contaminated sites in the Lake and Basin wetlands were collected as cores and interstitial water samples obtained using equilibrium dialyzers. Solid phase associations ofFe, S, and As were probed using x-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy. In Lake CDA sediments we identified agradient from oxic conditions at the sediment-water interface to anoxic conditions below 10 cm, thus creating adynamic redox environment that controls metal(loid) sorption and solubility. The oxic cap at the sediment-water interface traps many ofthe contaminant metal(loids) decreasing their flux into the overlying water column. However, flood events bury the oxic cap materials transitioning them to asuboxic zone in which reductive dissolution ofthe oxides releases metal(loid)s into the sediment interstitial water. High Fe:S ratios inhibit the formation of metal(loid)-containing sulfide precipitates in the anoxic zone, thus resulting in chronically and acutely toxic concentrations ofsoluble metals within the sediment interstitial water. In contrast, constantly saturated wetlands within the Basin do not maintain an oxic sediment cap and concentrations of metal(loid)s in sediment interstitial waters are consequently much lower than those in Lake CDA sediments. This series of reactions and processes presents a dilemma for lake management since promoting reduced conditions at the sediment-water interface in Lake CDA is an unacceptable method to decrease porewater metal(loid) concentrations. Decreased soluble metal(loid) concentrations in the sediments will only occur by minimizing the transport of contaminated materials to Lake CDA.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-cda_toevs_2006,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,191

Approximate solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for flow through a rectangularly packed bed of spheres,"Carson Jr., William McKinley",1970-08,,,fluid friction;,"Approximate solutions for the Navier -Stokes equations describing fluid fiow through a rectangular packing of spheres were obtained for Reynolds numbers of 0.1, 1, 7 and 35. Initial attempts to solve the Navier-Stokes equations with the inertia terms intact were unsuccessful. However, the methods used in these  solution attempts are given in detail. The results reported are based on an Oseen linearization of the full Navier-Stokes equations. The solutions were approximated by triple trigonometric series and the unknown coefficients evaluated using the Galerkin method for error distribution. Velocity components and pressure in the void space of the bed are given as explicit functions of the spacial coordinates. Friction factors for the packed bed and superficial velocity were evaluated from the velocity functions and are shown to agree with the experimental observations of previous investigators. The viscous and kinetic contribution to the energy dissipation are partitioned using first principles of the mechanical energy balance and evidence is given khat the viscous and kinetic effects determined by semiempirical methods do not show the actual relationship between viscous and kinetic losses in the intermediate Reynolds number range.

Groundwater flow systems and the origin of evaporite deposits. Pamphlet 141,"Williams, Roy E.",1968-08,,,groundwater flow;,"Study of the literature on evaporite mineral deposits suggests a functional realtionship between the origin of these deposits and ground-water flow systems. The theory on which the analysis of ground-water flow systems is based is reviewed in order to establish flow systems as a mechanism by which dissolved solids can be transported to sites of evaporite mineral accumulation. Comparison of observed spatial variations of ground-water quality with pertinent solutions to flow equations under specified boundary conditions reveals that quality of ground water is a function of flow path length, flow path route and flow velocity. Selected references provide evidence that sites of accumulation of non-marine evaporite minerals are discharge zones for poor quality water from regional ground-water flow systems. A study of isotope ratios in oil field brines and standard mean ocean water indicates that water in some deep brines is of local meteoric origin; therefore, the brines are part of a ground-water flow system. Observed distribution of fluid potential in the saline portion of some ground-water flow systems on the Atlantic Coast of the United States reveals that saline ground water discharges toward the ocean floor. Therefore, ground water may also act as a transport medium for dissolved solids which are precipitated, under appropriate conditions, as marine evaporite deposits.",Boise Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology,University of Idaho,eng,197023,iwdl-197023,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,198

Analysis of slot orifice fishways,"Dass, Purushottam",1970-12,,,fish barriers; fish ladders; fish migration,"The object of this study was to develop design criteria for a slot orifice fishway. Sizing and spacing of slot orifices inside the fishway can be designed to create flow conditions satisfactory for fish passage. The slot orifice fishway will function well in a wide range of discharges and should not have any serious s i l t i n g problems. Values of drag coefficients for the slot orifice constrictions were evaluated by model studies for a range of slot openings varying from 0.6 t o 0.85 of fishway width and culvert slope varying from horizontal to five percent. Three longitudinal spacings, 4, 5, and 6 times the fishway width, were considered for the slot orifices in the fishway. The effect of tailwater on the flow conditions at the fishway entrance was studied. The backwater relation of the slot orifice also was developed in the above range. Nondimensional carves are given for the values of the drag coefficients of the slot orifice constrictions and also for the backwater relations for the slot orifices. An equation, based on momentum principle, is developed which enables the designer to find the rate of flow through the fishway.

Data was secured for 8 farms by interviewing each farm operator and land owner. To make comparisons between farms and also between enterprises, the data was broken down into per acre variable costs, fixed costs, total returns, net income and the cost of producing a dollar's worth of output. The term 'cost per dollar of output' is the ratio of costs to returns. This ratio makes it possible to compare high-valued crops with low-valued crops on a per acre basis. This is a very sensitive measurement. For example, one cent change in the ratio for potato enterprise means a change in net income of $3.25 per acre. The budgeting method o f estimating water values in irrigation was used in this study. Long-run planning cost curves were estimated from the budgets by using (curvi-linear) regression. From the regression equations for each of the four enterprises (grain, sugar beets, potatoes and alfalfa seed), 12 model farms were constructed. The long-run average total cost curve for the model farms, which incorporates a long-run rotation and long-run price and yield expectations, indicated economies of size up to a farm size o f 2,400 acres. Net income -- the measurement of how much money is left over to pay for irrigation water after all expenses, including remuneration for management, land and investment, have been paid -- varied from about $50 t o $57 per acre for all model farms.",Boise Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197010,iwdl-197010,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,207
Economics of water quality control measures.,"Michalson, E.L.",1970-11-21,,,water quality; river basin management; legal aspects,"Water quality control is a broad problem in water resource management. Water quality control is a very complex problem and one which requires a broad framework for analysis. This problem is affected by the use water is put to, the location of the user on the river or lake in question, the number of water users, the number of waste disposers. In addition, water rights and other legal problems enter the picture. For these reasons, it i s necessary to look at a basin wide water quality control program. This approach has rnany ramifications for present users and future users. Who should pay for water quality control; who should be allowed to pollute and what kind of treatment or control is necessary? The remainder of this paper will be devoted to these problems.

Methodology study to develop evaluation criteria For Wild And Scenic Rivers: progress report no. 1,"Kirkland, Larry; Michalson, E. L.",1970,,,water conservation; wildlife conservation; fish conservation,"On October 2, 1968, Public Law 90-542, which provides for a National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was passed by the 90th Congress. This law spells out Federal policy for creating a system of selected rivers which possess within their immediate environment outstanding scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, and other similar values. The Act ensures that these rivers shall be preserved in their free flowing condition and that they shall be protected for the benefit of present and future generations. [...] In this study the Salmon River and its basin has been selected to develop a model system to evaluate Wild and Scenic Rivers. The logic of this choice revolves around two considerations, (1) the evaluation model is to be general, and (2) many upstream or offstream activities may be affected by a wild river designation. By this I am referring to the water quality and scenic vistas land withdrawals. In addition, any economic development-- impoundment, dredging, logging, etc. , would affect the wild segment of the river. A further reason is that any economic analysis of the area should include all the activity in the basin area to be meaningful. The objectives of this study are to inventory the natural and human resources of the area, and estimate future demands for quantities of these resources. Secondly, to identify, describe, and quanitfy , where possible, benefits from scenic beauty, personal enrichment, and other esthetic experiences derived from a river. Thirdly, to develop a series of economic models to evaluate and determine resource use patterns consistent with a Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and compare them with resource use patterns under varying levels of development. Finally, to present recommendations for alternative uses of resources for the entire river basins area, restrictions on use if classification is possible, and the economic and social ramifications of each of the alternatives considered.",Boise Basin,Methodology Study to Develop Evaluation Criteria for Wild and Scenic Rivers; Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197013,iwdl-197013,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,209

The field studies involved soil temperature and moisture measurements over a two year period during which there were no runoff events when the ground was frozen. A rainfall simulator was constructed and used t o a limited extent the second year of the study. The laboratory study involved measuring the permeability of frozen soil columns at various initial moisture contents. Air was used as a fluid to measure the permeability under isothermal conditions below 32' F. Data were obtained which relate the air permeability to the porosity of the soil and the moisture content or saturation at which freezing occurred. For the three soil types tested, it was possible to obtain impermeable conditions after freezing when the initial moisture content was in the neighborhood of the field capacity. The significant parameter affecting the permeability was d (1 - S) where d is the porosity and S is the saturation. The use of certain critical values of this parameter would enable a person to predict when the possibility of frozen ground floods exist by taking soil samples in the field.

Research technical completion report, project A-021-IDA","Williams, Roy E.",1969-06,,,water; filtration,"A method was developed for extracting water samples from unsaturated soils under low moisture content and concomitant high tension.  A sample collection cell was constructed by enclosing a hydrophylic, cross-linked, dextran xerogel in seamless dialyzer tubing with opening diameters of 48 angstroms.  When the cell is placed in contact with a soil, water and its dissolved ions move through the membrane and into the hydrophylic substance.  Because the ion exchange capacity of the xerogel is negligible, the water and ions can be replaced by distilled, deionized water and the effluent analyzed.  However, chemical analysis of the effluent has revealed that results are not reproducible and that unreasonably high concentrations of some ions often result.  Combination trace and infiltration tests have demonstrated that water moves through the loess soils of northern Idaho via discontinuities as well as through intergranual pore spaces.  Whether the discontinuities are operative in the infiltration process depends on the surface condition and on the application rate.  These must permit a saturated layer to form above the discontinuities before they can begin to conduct water preferentially.",Boise Basin,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196922,iwdl-196922,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,229

Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology, pamplet 143","Williams, Roy E.; Eier, Douglas D.; Wallace, Alfred T.",1969-10,,,industrial wastewater; wastewater irrigation; municipal wastewater,"The increasing rate of production of industrial and domestic wastewaters has prompted scientists and engineers to investigate methods of renovation which offer alternatives to disposal in surface water bodies. Reuse of effluent for irrigation, fertilization and ground water recharge is among the techniques which have received much attention during the past several years. A large number of studies have demonstrated that vegetation and the proper geologic column are capable of greatly reducing the nutrient content of wastewater. Concomitantly the irrigated crop receives the normal benefit of the wastewater, a s well a s the benefit of the fertilizer contained therein. The fertilizer value (nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) of domestic effluent has been estimated at about $18 per acre-foot; however, this figure can vary significantly. It has been demonstrated also that under appropriate hydrogeologic conditions wastewater renovated by a porous medium can be expected to meet U. S. Public Health Service drinking water standards. Appropriate hydrogeologic conditions include the presence of an unconsolidated porous medium (such as sand) through which the wastewater can move an appreciable distance (which will vary with geologic conditions) before entering a water supply; the absence of surficial, jointed rocks through which the wastewater might move without appreciable adsorption of dissolved solids by the porous medium; and a water table depth of at least five feet. Hydrogeologic conditions less than optimal will result in less than optimal renovation of the wastewater, in which case care must be taken during application if water supply sources are located near the disposal area. Only rarely will a given hydrogeologic environment not renovate wastewater to the equivalent of secondary (biological) treatment. In many cases renovation of wastewater by vegetation and the geologic column can be substituted for tertiary treatment.",Boise Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,196924,iwdl-196924,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,230

The first section deals with an inventory of livestock uses, grazing permits and AUM's in the Salmon River Basin. The next section discusses the role of grazing, its relationship to potential classification of the river and competition of uses such as water quality, wildlife, forest, water resources and recreation. The discussion section concludes with possible restrictions on range use if the river was classified. Next, a test case is given in which the method presented is used. Alternative classifications are presented, an inventory made, resource maps considered, alternative classification evaluated and conclusions drawn. It was estimated that there were about 2.7 million acres of forest land and 2.4 million acres of range land grazed in the Basin. The AUM's on national forest land were approximately 129,000 and on BLM land, 239,000 respectively. The total number of permittees reported was 583. The remainder of the report discusses the effects of classification and the relationships between recreation and livestock grazing. There doesn't seem to be much conflict between grazing and river classification. Generally, there is little, if any, grazing in the areas which would be classified as scenic or wild and it is an established practice in the recreational portion. In the case of recreation, livestock grazing may present some problems in terms of river access. These primarily related to disturbing cattle on ranges and opening and closing of gates.

This project was designed to explore the role played by carbon and its subsequent use by bacteria on various chemical and biological para meters in Dworshak reservoir. Carbon contribution to the reservoir is primarily from the existing organic material present on the preimpoundment floor. This study defines methodology enabling prediction of the levels of carbon in a reservoir prior to impoundment and explores some of the effects of that carbon. In addition, these methods can be used to determine the amount of leached carbon, readily usable, by heterotrophic bacteria. The effect of carbon utilization by bacteria on algal growth is also explored. In the laboratory this symbiotic effect leads to significant increases in algal biomass even at carbon levels as low as 1. 3 ppm.

The equation developed estimated that the average hunting trip consisted of about 6.8 visitor days and cost per visitor day was $9.78. A demand schedule was developed using this equation which indicated the alternative prices for various levels of use. A further development in this section was that of estimating the resource value of hunting in the Sawtooth area. This resource value was estimated to be $186,419 in 1971, and the total amount of money hunters spent on the hunting experience in the Sawtooth was $74,690.

C.",1973-09,,,evapotranspiration; water balance; snowmelt; runoff; erosion,"Many low and intermediate elevation watersheds in the Pacific Northwest receive both rain and snow precipitation during the winter months. This results in winter runoff events that are damaging to agricultural land and can also decrease the snow water storage limiting water availability in late spring and early summer. The winter and spring runoff from forested lands was studied at a snow research site where melt from the rain and snow events could be measured. Predictable lags occurred between time of melt and time of peak in stream hydrographs. The Kentucky Watershed Model was also used to evaluate the effects of precipitation type and amount on runoff patterns. Runoff in the early winter was not satisfactorily modeled. An agricultural watershed was used to study runoff and erosion resulting from rain on snow and rain on frozen ground. Soil loss was found to depend mainly on amounts of precipitation since runoff began, volume of runoff, change in snow cover and soil moisture conditions. Rain on frozen ground produced less erosion than com parable amounts of rain on bare unfrozen soil. A study of the water balance showed that precipitation was distributed approximately 27 percent to runoff, 57 percent to evapotranspiration and 16 percent to deep percolation. It also showed the Penman method of computing evapotranspiration was satisfactory when compared to soil moisture changes.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197332,iwdl-molnau_1973,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,244

A computer program was developed and used to compute a nutrient, total solids and water budget for the unit based on water measurements, climatic measurements, cropping data and chemical analyses. Excessive amounts of water applied to onion crops were responsible for a portion of the applied water entering the groundwater through deep percolation carrying with it part of the nitrogen applied as fertilizer. However, the other crops, sugar beets and beans, were found to use shallow groundwater for part of their consumptive use requirements, The only materials which were lost from the farm in appreciable quantities in the surface runoff were found to be total solids and the associated phosphorous except when nitrogen was added to the irrigation water as fertilizer, Sediment ponds installed on the farm were found to be effective in removing sediments and phosphorous from the surface runoff,",IWRRI,,,"Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Lewis, G.

Wild River perception and management: Study of users and managers of the Middle Fork of the Salmon River,"Peckfelder, Robert Larry",1973-06,Salmon River,"45.74, -116.32",recreation; floating; surveys,"Evidence indicates that foresters who manage the Middle Fork of the Salmon River are very much in tune with floaters in their personal outlook on river management. Middle Fork managers correctly predicted user reactions to more than three-fourths of the questionnaire statements presented in this study. Sampling included 253 of 367 floaters and all Forest Service personnel questionnaires were returned. Eighty percent of the statements were correctly perceived by managers. Forest Service personnel, however, did not accurately perceive many of the characteristics of users,. First, managers indicated that only 35% of the users would belong to conservation organizations while this study found that more than half (52%) of the users belonged to such organizations. Second, managers did not have a good indication of the educational level and income of floaters -- managers indicated that only 49% of the users would have a college education or higher and an average income of $15,000 while this study found that 69% of the users had a college degree or higher and an average in come of $26, 000. Finally, managers did not have a good indication of the types of user floating the Middle Forkï¿½managers indicated that 77% of the users fell into the commercial group while this study found that only 68% of the users fit into this category. Managers did not feel as strongly about environmental issues as did users. Fifty percent of the users showed a definite ''strong purist'' attitude about the environmental statements presented while managers indicated a less intense purist attitude. Users responded more intensely than managers to the importance of solitude in the wild river experience. Eighty percent of the users felt solitude was ''very important'' to the floating experience while only 58% of the managers indicated solitude was ''very important'' to the wild river experience. Managers appeared to be more development-oriented than did users. Ninety-two percent of the managers felt that users would be ''bothered'' at camping in places with no sanitary facilities or developed areas while 65% of the users indicated they would ''enjoy'' such areas. Forest Service personnel stressed stronger feeling toward the need for controls on the Middle Fork than did users. All managers favored controlling use of the river at the present time while only 64% of the users were in favor of such action. In addition, all Forest Service personnel indicated that limiting the size of parties floating the river is necessary while only 73% of the users favored party size limitations. The responses to management alternatives were not generally perceived by managers. Forest Service personnel indicated that users would oppose the restriction of limiting use to only those with prior river experience when in fact more than 20% of the users favored such action. In addition, approximately 80% of the Forest Service personnel responding felt users would favor the issuance of a limited number of permits on a first-come, first-served basis. A majority of the users (55%) indicated they were opposed to this alternative. Also, managers felt users would favor the assignment of campsites when in fact 59% of the users opposed this alternative. Middle Fork managers appear to be similar in their responses to those of users which indicates knowledge of the Middle Fork user.

Insect drift was taken on riffles at three distances from the shoreline in water depths of 30, 2 2 45 and 60 cm. Square metal frames .093 m (1 ft ) with nylon netting similar to the netting used on the Hess sampler (1.1 mm mesh diameter, 7 meshes cm) were used for drift sampling. Littoral variation in number and weight of riffle insects was shown to be affected by changes in depth and current velocity, inter acting with the date and station of sampling. This differential lit toral distribution of riffle insects resulted in variation of the lit toral community structure. In the non-fluctuating system, community diversity and diversity per individual decreased with increasing depths to 45 cm and current velocity to 1.1 m/sec.

An interview-type survey was obtained from the study area located in Ada and Canyon Counties, Idaho, for the purpose of completing partial farm budgets. Regression analysis applied to this data resulted in a unit cost curve showing slight economies of size for large farm acreages as opposed to smaller acreages. The unit cost curve was incorporated in the objective function of a linear programming model utilizing land, labor, and water as real restrictions. Artificial resources were Included in the activity analysis as restrictions to determine the optimum allocation of these resources for commodity production on 160, 320, 480, and 640 acre model farms. The outcome showed that the allocation of the resources for commodity production resulted in positive net returns for the three larger model farms. Also the activity analysis resulted in water being the most limiting resource. But the value of the irrigation water was shown to be comparable to water costs of other Southern Idaho irrigation areas. Projections of Income and population changes resulting from primary agricultural production on the project lands were also estimated. The data of the activity analysis were adapted to aparametric linear programming analysis to research the effect of varying potato and sugar beet commodity prices has on the resource allocation and production plans of the model feme. The conclusion of this analysis was that production of these two commodities is stable as large commodity price changes are necessary to alter the current resource allocation for changes in the production of either potatoes or sugar I beets.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197340,iwdl-reid_1973,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,248

Field data obtained in physical modeling oi individual trees and data taken from the literature were used to define mathematical relationships for the intercepted precipitation and modeled ''species'' variations in trees. The defined relationships were subsequently incorporated in a computer simulation model for prediction of interception storage by a stand of trees. Comparison of interception storage derived from the stand model with measurements on the model trees indicates reasonable predictive capacity for both individual tree and stand models. Several forms of the sigmoid curve were useful in defining relationships between precipitation, interception storage and the end of storms and vegetational parameters, Surface ratio, related to crown projection area, was found to be a suitable parameter in defining differences in the format of the sigmoid curves. Second portion of the study was conducted to determine the interception characteristics of both artificial and real trees using artificial snow. A drum apparatus was constructed to allow ar+ificial snow to be dropped over the trees. It was found that for 3 ft. high artificial trees, the smaller branch angles intercept more snow than larger branch angles in terms of interception over projected areas of the tree.

The portable test unit was constructed so that it could easily be transported to a field site for testing. Several applications used the ozone test unit. It was found that the dark brown, odorous wastes effluent from a kraft pulp mill could be satisfactorily decolorized and deodorized by the ozone. In addition, it was found that the material after ozonation was more biodegradable than before ozonation. The ozone test unit was also used to treat potable water supplies to remove iron and manganese and to reduce off odors and tastes. Tests run on the Moscow, Idaho, water supply demonstrated that ozone could effectively remove high concentrations of both iron and manganese (1- 5 mg/1 Fe and 0. 1 - 1 mg/lMg).",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,"Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Harding, Harvey L.; Smith, Michael A.; Langeland, A.

A study was conducted during the summer recreational season to obtain the necessary information to statistically estimate the demand for and net economic value of recreation in the Sawtooth area. An ordinary least squares regression estimating procedure was employed to obtain the statistical demand estimate. The consumer's surplus approach was utilized to impute the net economic value of recreation. An aggregate consumer's surplus value of $2,627,813 was derived as an average value of $3.73 per visitor day. Despite the inherent limitations associated with recreational values imputed from recreational demand curves, the values derived therefrom potentially afford a valuable decision-making tool.

In order to obtain the necessary data, measuring devices were installed in all ditches and equipped with stage recorders to obtain a continuous record of the flows entering and leaving the farm. Water samples of the head- and tailwater were collected during each irrigation set. Samples of the ground water were periodically collected from ten twelve-foot piezometers located on the farm. During 1972, four sets of solution samplers were installed in each field. Samples of the soil solution at various depths were collected from these samplers after each irrigation.

Methodology for in-stream rehabilitation of a silted stream,"Kelly, Thomas L.",1974-04,Emerald Creek,"47.06, -116.32",silting; rehabilitation; sediment control,"The purpose of this project was to develop methodology for rehabilitating streams where the fishery and other recreational uses have been destroyed or greatly reduced by heavy silting. Using Emerald Creek in northern Idaho as a study stream two types of in-stream modification structures, flow constrictors and drop structures, were designed, constructed and evaluated. Contour maps and thalweg profiles of the before and after modification conditions are presented for each of the five stream modification sites. Three drop structures were constructed at two sites on the upper reach of Emerald Creek. These structures concentrate the energy of the flow and scour a hole downstream of the structure. Considerations in the design of drop structures include forces on the structure, backwater caused by the structure, and depth of scour below the structure. In general the log drop structures per formed favorably. Scour holes formed downstream of two of the drop structures to a depth of 1.0 ft and 1.5 ft as compared to a predicted scour depth of 2.0 ft and 3.0 ft respectively. The scour holes were lined with rock from six to ten inches in diameter. The flow constricting structures were designed to reduce the width and increase the depth of flow during low flow periods to increase the sediment trans port capacity of the stream thus flushing the silts and fine sands from the modified reach leaving cobble and small boulders. Gabion deflectors were used at two sites on the lower reach of Emerald Creek to constrict the flow. Log dikes were used at one site to constrict the flow and train the stream to follow a meandering flow path. Design considerations for flow constrictors include forces on the structure, location of structure, meander dimensions, and constriction dimensions. The performance of the gabion constrictors was acceptable at one site. Silts and sands were removed from the reach leaving cobble and boulders. Performance at the other gabion constrictor site was fair. Small amounts of silt and sand were re moved from the reach. Cobble and small boulders moved into the constricted flow area from an upstream riffle. The log dikes used to form a meandering flow pattern during low flow appeared to be functioning as planned but were removed by high flows before analysis of the modification was completed. A method for measuring the streambed hydraulic conductivity using standpipes is suggested as a means for determining the change in bed characteristics resulting from deposition of silt. Calibration curves for the standpipes were developed in the laboratory for future testing in the field.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197416,iwdl-kelly_1974,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,272

The model includes a mass balance calculation routine, a routine to simulate open surface drains and aroutine to calculate flow across hydraulically connected boundaries, such as a lake or stream. The parameter calibration routine as well as all other routines were tested and successfully applied to the gravel aquifer of the Snake River fan in eastern Idaho and the basalt aquifer of the Snake River plain in southern Idaho.

The rubbly rock at the top and bottom of some of the flows is permeable and transmits water laterally between the flows. Where the strata are displaced vertically by faults, barriers to movement of the water are common. Where these barriers are transverse to the dip of the basalt layers, ground-water reservoirs are formed. Many such reservoirs are present in mountainous areas or on the flanks of mountain uplands, and their water has been little used to date. Properly designed and constructed test wells are suggested as a means of determining the feasibility of withdrawing water from these reservoirs during the growing season and allowing the reservoirs to refill during the winter and spring.

A three-dimensional numerical computer model of ground-water flow is constructed to guide this management. Basalt aquifer thicknesses of 0 to 3500 feet are determined by a magnetotelluric geophysical survey in support of the study. The model incorporates a Grande Ronde Basalt layer, a Wanapum Basalt layer, and an overlying surficial loess layer. A recharge rate of 139 cubic feet per second to the upper layer of the ground-water flow model is calculated using a recharge model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Ground-water discharge is modeled as stream inflow and seepage where a layer is incised by a river. Cross-sectional models distributed across the domain of the three-dimensional model along flow lines provide an efficient means of obtaining hydraulic coefficient input for the three-dimensional model. The three-dimensional model is calibrated using the time-average method and evaluated through a history match procedure. The model incorporates numerous assumptions and simplifications; model predictions therefore are indicative only of general trends for the future. The model suggests that it is possible for ground-water levels to stabilize if ground-water pumpage stabilizes at a constant level.

While Well #3 was off line, Well #5 supplied all of the city's water. The increased demand caused apparent water level decline in the upper (Wanapum) aquifer and prompted a search for an alternate source. After an unsuccessful attempt at drilling to find an adequate water source, this study was implemented to analyze the occurrence, quantity, and quality of ground water in the Genesee area with respect to long-term availability. An investigation of the ground-water resources in the Genesee area included well location, water level measurements, collection of pumpage records, and the compilation of geological and hydrological data for Moscow, Pullman, Lewiston, and Clarkston. A hydrogeological conceptual model was created for Genesee from comparisons of this data. The model indicates that several locations are not recommended for further development of the Wanapum aquifer because of contamination, elevation, low yield, and well interference. Based on the model, development of the upper aquifer may requlre the drilling of several test wells to obtain the desired yield. No conclusions can be made for the availability of water in the lower (Grande Ronde) aquifer. Careful collection of all geologic and hydrologic data is recommended during the construction of any new well.

Relation of groundwater and surface water at the University of Idaho Groundwater Research Site,"Pardo, Begona Garcia",1993-06,Moscow,"46.73, -116.99",hydrogeology; surface-groundwater relations; aquifers,"The relation between surface water and groundwater must be considered when defining the hydrogeological characteristics' of a basin. The purpose of this thesis is to characterize the surface-groundwater relation at the University of Idaho Groundwater Research Site (UIGRS), in the Pullman-Moscow basin, Washington and Idaho. Eighteen wells at the UIGRS; six wells are completed in alluvial sediments and broken basalts, and twelve at different depths and fracture zones in the Wanapum basalt. Two main fracture zones define two aquifers: theE-fractured and theW-fractured basalt aquifers. The surface-groundwater relation was defined by using qualitative analysis. The methodology used in this analysis was the interpretation of the water changes throughout a four-year period and on specific events using hydrographs of stream stage and groundwater levels, as well as precipitation. The water level of the creek and the shallow and E-fractured basalt aquifer wells followed the same fluctuation pattern, whereas theW-fractured aquifer wells behaved in a different manner. The difference may be related to the barometric effect' and/or to different sources of recharge. The character of the fluctuation for the shallow and Efractured aquifer was defined by the distance from the creek and by the intensity and distribution of precipitation. During the summer and early fall, as well as often during maximum streamflow events, Paradise Creek may recharge the shallow and E-fractured basalt aquifers. The main source of water may be direct precipitation throughout the rest of the year. It is suggested that continuous data recording and chemical data analyses would contribute valuable additional information about the recharge and discharge mechanisms of the Pullman-Moscow basin.",Palouse Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-1993_pardo_relation_between_g_w,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,331

Hydrogeologic sub-basins in the Palouse area of Idaho and Washington,"Teasdale, Eddy W.",2002-05,Palouse,"46.88, -117.17",groundwater; aquifers; hydrogeology,"The study referred to as 'the Palouse area' encompasses approximately 408 square miles, and includes portions of northern Idaho and eastern Washington. The Palouse area relies almost entirely on ground water for its supply of municipal, domestic and institutional water. The majority of the ground water comes from two aquifers in the Miocene basalts of the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) with associated interbedded gravel, sand, silt and clay. The upper aquifer is in the Priest Rapids Member of the Wanapum Formation and deeper aquifer is the Grande Ronde Formation. Decline in water levels in both aquifers has been the focus of considerable research into the hydrogeology of the system since the early 1970's. Ground water research has added tot eh general overall understanding of the region but no geologic or hydrogeologic model has adequately predicted or explained the system. Little geologic research has been conducted at scales less than 1:250,000. Previous investigations of rare outcrops along with sporadic detailed lithologic well data suggested that the basalt units are undeformed and nearly horizontal. Several isopach and structural contour maps were constructed for the basalt and sedimentary units. These maps indicate that the rock units are not horizontal and undeformed. A review of old and new geologic data supports the conclusion that the basalts are not horizontal, and that in places they are folded into narrow anticlinal ridges separated by wide sinclinal troughs. These structural features divide the Palouse area into at least two different sub-basins. Drainage pattern difference sin the Palouse area also suggest different sub-basins. In places, stream patterns can be related to structures identified on sub-surface maps and/or existing geologic maps. Selective hydrogeological data were re-interpreted, and can be related to these sub-basins. These data consist of: ground water pump tests, static ground water levels and hydrographs. The combination of the structural contour and isopach maps, geological trends, drainage patterns, and re-interpreted hydrogeological data strongly indicate that the Palouse area is subdivided into at least two ground water sub-basins with identifiable subsurface structural features.",Palouse Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-2002_teasdale_hydrogeologic_subdivisions,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,334

In the past, the major streams and rivers in Whitman County including Union Flat Creek, the South Fork of the Palouse River, and the Snake River have been considered the major ground water discharge areas for the Moscow-Pullman basin. Tributary flow into these streams is derived from multiple springs discharging from the valley walls. Recharge mechanisms have generally been considered to either be a combination of areally distributed infiltration of precipitation through the loess and infiltration of water through the Sediments of Bovill or at the contact of the crystalline rock and the basalt In order to estimate the available ground water supply, a better understanding of the mechanisms affecting natural discharge and recharge to the system must first be established.

Radiocarbon dating as a tool for hydrogeological investigations in the Palouse Basin,"Douglas, Alyssa A.",2004-05,Palouse,"46.88, -117.17",groundwater dating; groundwater recharge; groundwater discharge,"Radiocarbon dating is an important tool for understanding residence time, or ''age'' of ground water in an aquifer system. This thesis presents the results of a radiocarbon dating study completed in the Palouse Basin of eastern Washington and northern Idaho. The ground water age or residence time, implies the amount of time elapsed between ground water recharge and the time when the ground water sample was collected. Estimates of ground water age typically require extensive interpretations of physical, chemical and biological processes that act on 14C and should not be considered as a true age, but rather as a ''model age.'' Thirty-one samples were collected throughout the Palouse Basin between 2001 and 2003, in the loess, granite, Wanapum basalts, and primarily the Grande Ronde basalts. In the Palouse Basin, 14C concentrations indicate generally increasing age with increasing depth below the land surface. Relative ages of the ground water in the four major pumping centers range from oldest in the Palouse and Moscow areas to youngest in the Pullman and Colfax areas. Historically, nonpumping water levels throughout the basin have shown relatively flat horizontal gradients compared to steep, vertical gradients, suggesting relatively high horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the basalt aquifers, and very low vertical hydraulic conductivity in the interiors of basalt flows. It is conceptualized that the Palouse Basin is characteristically shaped like a ''bathtub'' filled with basalt lava flows and interbedded sediments. Vertical ground water recharge to the deep basalt aquifers is dominated by extremely slow vertical migration rates relative to current pumping withdrawals.",Palouse Basin,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-2004_douglas_radiocarbon_dating_as_a_tool,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,337

Latah County hydrologic characterization project. Final report,"Fairley, Jerry P.; Solomon, Mark D.; Hinds, Jennifer J.; Grader, George W.; Bush, John H.; Rand, Amber L.",2006-09-30,Latah County,,hydrologic systems; hydrologic basins; groundwater recharge; sediments; hydrologic systems,"The purpose of the Latah County Hydrologic Characterization Project was to evaluate the potential for shallow groundwater recharge to the upper aquifer in the Moscow area (the “Wanapum aquifer”) through sediments along the granite/basalt contact, in the vicinity of Moscow Mountain. 47 boreholes were advanced into nearsurface sediments and 6 boreholes were cored into the top 20 feet of Priest Rapids basalt in the South Fork of the Palouse River and Paradise Creek drainages. The Wanapum aquifer is generally understood as being hosted within the Miocene Priest Rapids Member of the Wanapum Formation, includes the underlying sediments and sedimentary interbeds, and is believed to be distinct from the deeper Grande Ronde aquifer. Investigation showed a consistent pattern of sediment deposition, in which granite and/or metamorphic rocks were overlain by heterogeneous (intermixed coarse and fine) sediments of moderate to high permeability, ranging in thickness from 14 to 54 feet. Basalt flows in the area of this investigation were ubiquitously overlain by a substantial thickness (20 – 25 feet) of low permeability fine sediments (poorly sorted silts, sands, and clays, and peat); these low-permeability sediments were overlain by heterogeneous sediments of relatively high permeability, similar in character to those overlying granitic bedrock. Many of the boreholes in basalt terrain encountered elevated moisture contents at the contact between the low permeability sediments and the overlying sediments of higher permeability. In addition, hydrologic testing and examination of core recovered from the boreholes that penetrated the Priest Rapids basalt suggests limited hydrologic connectivity with the overlying sediments, even though the basalt interior probably has substantial bulk (fracture) permeability. On the basis of data gathered in this study, we conclude that recharge to the shallow aquifer along the eastern margin of the Palouse Basin is probably limited by thick, low permeability sediments and poor connectivity between the Priest Rapids basalt and the overlying sediments. It appears likely that the majority of infiltration entering the nearsurface sediments flows laterally through discontinuous, high permeability sediments until it discharges into local streams (i.e., the South Fork of the Palouse River, Paradise Creek, or their tributaries) or intersects the land surface as spring discharge.

At issue are the classic points surrounding water quantities and the sustainability of current and projected pumpages. In addressing those issues, two major contentions arise: the areal extent of the corresponding aquifer(s) and the recharge it receives. Recognizing the latter has gotten most recent attention, it is the question of size of the Basin to which this work has been directed. Here, we examine the historical evidence of the reported geology and water records to postulate a fairly radical physical picture of the Grande Ronde aquifer and its western extent along the Snake River. IN particular, an examination is made of the possibility of a ""no-flow"" barrier in that area, wherein explaining the unusual piezometric heads known to exist in the region.

The relation between streams and ground-water flow systems within the Pullman-Moscow Area of Washington and Idaho,"Heinemann, Ronald",1994-12,Moscow,"46.73, -116.99",pumpage; water supply management; groundwater discharge,"A three-dimensional computer model of ground-water flow  in the Pullman-Moscow area of Washington and Idaho was  constructed in 1987 to address concerns over increasing  pumpage rates and declining ground-water levels in the Grande  Ronde Formation of the Columbia River Basalts. An integral  part of the model is the interconnection of ground water and  surface water. Streamflow measurements from a 1984 USGS  survey suggest that a significant amount of ground water may  be discharging from basalt aquifers and associated interbeds to streams within the area.  Six Pullman-Moscow area streams which are incised into  the basalt stratigraphy were investigated to locate zones  where ground-water discharge/recharge is occurring. Stream  temperature surveys and geologic cross sections were used to  identify and describe possible ground-water discharge areas.  Results of the study suggest that sedimentary deposits  located along the eastern terminus of the Roza Member of the  Wanapum Formation are a source for ground-water discharge  along Union Flat Creek, the North Fork of the Palouse River,  and Four Mile Creek.

We measured bedload sediment transported in the streams during the spring snowmelt runoff and the summer lowflow periods for 2 years, to test the applicability of the Meyer-Peter, Muller equation for estimating such transport. In both years the streams transported all the sediment available, including that under the armor layer of the stream bottom in the first year. The modified MeyerPeter, Muller equation proved accurate in estimating the transport capacity of such streams using measurements of slope, hydraulic radius and mean diameter of streambed material. In artificial stream channels, benthic insect density in fully sedimented riffles(> 2/3 cobble imbeddedness) was one-half that in unsedimented riffles, but the abundance of drifting insects in the sedimented channels was not significantly smaller. In a natural stream riffle, benthic insects were 1.5 times more abundant in a plot cleaned of sediment, with mayflies and stoneflies 4 and 8 times more abundant, respectively. Riffle beetles (Elmidae) were more abundant in the uncleaned plot. During both summer and winter, fewer fish remained in the artificial stream channels where sediment was added to the pools. The interstices between the large rocks in the pools provided essential cover necessary to maintain large densities of fish. Fish in sedimented channels exhibited hierarchical behavior, while those in unsedimented channels were territorial in behavior. In small natural pools ( 100 to 200 m^2 ), a loss in pool volume or in area deeper than 0.3 m from additions of sediment resulted in a proportional decrease in fish numbers. We did not, however, find significant correlations between riffle sedimentation and fish density in the two natural streams we studied. Fish abundance was significantly correlated with insect drift abundance in one stream, but not in the other. The amounts of sediment in the two streams studied did not have an obvious adverse effect on the abundance of fish or the insect drift on which they feed.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197701,iwdl-197701,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,356

Methodology for analysis of irrigation development that might have occurred without federal expenditure.

This treatise attempts to analyze, the possible outcomes in the absence of any federal support in this field, by means of a case study of a federally funded (Boise) project and its possible nonfederal alternatives. In this study a useful methodology of simultaneously combining hydrologic and water supply operations analyses with economic analysis of a water development project has been developed in accordance with 'The Principles and Standards' specified by U.S. Water Resources Council concerning evaluation of 'Conditions expected without' the federal expenditure. On the basis of comparison of engineering, economic and financial efficiencies of the historic irrigation development due to the federal Boise Project and four possible non-federal alternatives (with seven different variations of each), it has been demonstrated that the federal project was as good as any other non-federal alternative could possibly have been under the circumstances existing prior and during the period of study.

This first report of the economic subproject brings together the relevant direct cost and return (benefit) information from the project. Since the public is often concerned about the economic justification for such a project, an effort is made to present the cost and return information in such a way as to indicate the public expenditures made in terms of tax dollars and the income benefits received in terms of value added. Benefit-cost ratios are presented in terms of value added (net income) per dollar of project cost for each year from 1910 to 1970. This measure of success (or failure) of the project varies from a negative $0.59 in 1932 to a positive $21.29. Prior to 1940, and especially during the depression years, the project was what one might consider a marginal economic success. After 1940 and the second World War, however, the above measure indicated each dollar of public funds expended were associated with about $5 in income to someone in the area. Obviously, the project also had secondary or indirect impacts on the region in which it was located -- these impacts will be identified and discussed in the second volume of this report. It should be emphasized that the numbers in this report (costs and returns) represent all the economic factors involved in the project and the subsequent irrigated crop production. No attempt has been made to allocate benefits to water, land, technology, or management.

Methodology for optimization of an irrigation system with storage reservoirs. OWRT matching grant project B-041-IDA,"Khanjani, Mohammad Javad",1980-08,,,irrigation efficiency; irrigation systems; economic efficiency,"A procedure was developed to specify optimal plans for an irrigation system with temporary internal storage. The procedure was used to develop plans for 1865 ha using farm service reservoirs. Daily potential and actual evapotranspiration for 25 years were computed. Probability distributions of patential and actual evapotranspiration for 1-30 days duration were estimated. A log-normal probability distribution was found to best fit the data, and probability equations for different durations were computed. These distributions were used to determine possible irrigation intervals for different crops growing in different soil types. Costs of different types of irrigation subsystem cornponents were computed including canal sections, farm service reservoirs, pumps, and sprinkler and gravity application subsystems. A marginal cost and benefit analysis was used to select the best irrigation intervals for all soil-crop cornbinations. The time of occurrence of maximum evapotranspiration for each crop was analyzed and found to follow a log-normal distribution. The peak water requirement of each crop was Xlll computed to determine the peak water requirement of each subunit within the study area. Water-use information was used to compute the volume of interval storage needed within the system. Fifteen farm service reservoirs were located at 15 specified sites by considering physical conditions and other restrictions. Costs and design capacities of farm service reservoirs and canal sections of the system were computed. By utilizing a mixed integer programming model, the locations of farm service reservoirs were optimized; and seven of the original 15 farm service reservoir sites were selected. A linear programming model was then used to compute the optimum capacity of each farm service reservoir, and parametric programming was used to examine the effects of varying water costs of system configuration. The cost and design capacity of the irrigation system with seven farm service reservoirs was computed. The total cost was 32% less than the cost of the irrigation system with the 15 original proposed farm service reservoirs.",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198013,iwdl-198013,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,376

The general objective of this project is to provide a preliminary assessment of alternative management schemes for problems of overdraft of ground water basins. Four study basins were selected to represent the range of ground water development problems and the various stages of present resource management. Ground water development in the Moscow Basin has resulted in a steady rate of water level decline in what is likely a ''mining'' situation. Local areas of water level decline have resulted from recent development of ground water in the Mountain Home area. A portion of this area is presently declared critical under present statutes. Water levels are slowly declining in the Camas Prairie area as a result of changing from dry land to irrigated agriculture. Impacts from pumpage in this area may interfere with prior downstream surface water rights. The Raft River Basin was declared critical in 1963. Impacts from ground water development include more than 100 feet of water level decline and some indications of land subsidence. Management factors have been divided into three groups: hydrologic, development and legal guidelines. Hydrologic factors of importance to management are the water level response of a basin to pumpage and the effects that water level declines have on recharge and discharge amounts. The development factors, the pumpage rate in relation to recharge, the depth to water and annual rate of decline and the potential for increased pumpage. The important legal guidelines are limits on adverse impacts on other users, a no-mining limit on pumpage and a limit on reasonable pumping lifts.

The average seepage meter rates are 23 percent higher than ponded rates. A method for determining the required number of seepage meter tests is outlined. Seasonal variation of soil moisture tension in the soil prism beneath an operating canal are measured, using two methods of tensiometer installation and readout. Increases in soil moisture tension from 0 to 5. 5 feet of water over the irrigation season is indicative of the gradual sealing of the canal bottom and corresponding decreases in seepage rates. Field and laboratory conductivity measurements indicate the impeding layer in the canal bottom has a saturated hydraulic conductivity of about 1/50 that of the natural soil beneath the layel"""" at the end of the irrigation season. A new method for securing and testing undisturbed soil cores using shrinkable plastic tubing is outlined.

This led to public concern about the status and future of water resources in the valley. The following questions typify those that were asked about Treasure Valley water supplies: 1. Does the Treasure Valley have a ground water shortage? 2. How has and does land development impact Treasure Valley water supplies? 3. Where and to what degree are ground water levels declining? 4. What is the carrying capacity of the hydrologic system in the Treasure Valley? 5. How big is our aquifer system? Where are the aquifer boundaries? 6. How are shallow and deep aquifers connected? 7. How are Treasure Valley aquifer systems recharged and where does the recharge occur? 8. How susceptible is the Treasure Valley aquifer system to contamination? 9. What is the degree of hydraulic connection between Treasure Valley surface and ground water? 10. Is water conservation necessary to meet future water demands? 11. Can additional tools and/or data be developed to assist local, state, and federal governments with decisions on issues that impact water resources, such as land use planning, zoning, water rights, septic tank permitting, waste treatment, etc.? The Treasure Valley Hydrologic Project (TVHP) was formed to provide technical information needed to address most of these issues and to provide a framework for future water management. The project included characterization of ground water flow in the Treasure Valley aquifer system, evaluation of flow system geochemistry, estimation of ground water residence times, and construction of a numerical model of ground water flow.

An economic study of the potential for water markets in Idaho,"Whittlesey, Norman; Hamilton, Joel; Halverson, Philip",1986-12,,,hydroelectric power; irrigation; economic feasibility,"This study investigated the economic potential for water markets that would exchange water from irrigated agricultural to hydropower production in southern Idaho. Two kinds of water market were considered. The first involved the marketing of stored water that is now owned by agricultural interests but is seldom used for irrigation. The second was an option lease program that would depend on water currently used for irrigation. A market for stored water is currently working but could be modified to increase the market value of the water. The value that could be created by selling stored water for hydropower far exceeds its current value in storage or for agricultural uses. It is conservatively estimated that the power value of this water ranges from $10 to $22 per acre-foot, while the current price being paid for power production is $2.50 per acre-foot. The option lease program also appears to be economically feasible. This program would allow agriculture to use the water in most years and require its use for hydropower only during critical flow periods. Thus, agriculture remains intact while the water continues to create value in hydropower. The program analyzed would reduce average agricultural income about $2.50 per acre while the value of hydropower created would be about ten times this amount.",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198604,iwdl-198604,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,398

Stream biota was sampled from June 1987 through September 1987. The original Index of Biotic Integrity, as developed for midwestern U.S. streams, was unsuitable for use in northern Idaho. Only four of the 12 metrics included in the original IBI reflected changes in the biotic integrity of northern Idaho streams. The original IBI, although significantly correlated with measures of stream quality, was too insensitive and classified lower quality streams as being in ''good to excellent'' health. We modified the original IBI to contain eight metrics to reflect the health of the fish, amphibian, and aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Also, expectation criteria of three metrics were adjusted for relative stream size. Our modified IBI seems to adequately assess the health of northern Idaho headwater streams. The modified IBI detected changes in stream health, as index scores were significantly correlated with road density and percent harvest of the drainages. Also, the modified IBI was more highly correlated with measures of impact and less significantly with the measures of stream size than Shannon diversity of fishes by biomass or numbers, the Index of Well Being, and Brillouin diversity of both fishes and aquatic macroinvertebrates. The modified Index of Biotic Integrity offers managers a technique to evaluate stream health with limited vertebrate and invertebrate sampling.

(1990). A ground-water flow model was cooperatively developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Idaho in the 1980's to predict the impact of future ground-water withdrawals on aquifer water levels in the Pullman-Moscow area. This three-dimensional model was transferred from the University of Idaho mainframe computer to personal computer compatible files. These original file are retained for time-averaged, history-match and predictive simulations. The Pullman-Moscow ground-water flow model includes several assumptions which are difficult to support with the current level of information. Probably the greatest concern is the uncertainty of recharge and discharge to the deepest model layer in the Grand Ronde basalt. Most recharge to and discharge from this layer can not be directly measured. Evidence suggests, however, that discharge along the Snake River canyon has been overestimated. Over-estimation of this discharge would have adversely affected model calibration. A five-layer revision of the model was developed that subdivided the aquifer in the Grande Ronde basalt into three layers. The revised model was not re-calibrated due to inadequate information on aquifer water levels and characteristics.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199605,iwdl-199605,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"Adobe Acrobat 10.1.4 Paper capture plug-in, 1,239,785 bytes; Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,409
Depth and temporal variations in water quality of the Snake River Plain Aquifer in Well USGS-59 near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Research technical note 97-1,"Frederick, David B.; Johnson, Gary S.",1997-03,USGS-59,"43.53, -112.04",in situ tests; groundwater; conductance; geochemistry; aquifer testing,"In-situ measurements of the specific conductance and temperature of ground water in the Snake River Plain aquifer were collected in observation well USGS-59 near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. These parameters were monitored at various depths in the aquifer from October 1994 to August 1995. The specific conductance of ground water in well USGS-59, as measured in the borehole, ranged from about 450 to 900 flS/cm at standard temperature (25ï¿½ C). The pumping cycle of the production wells at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant causes changes in borehole circulation patterns, and as a result the specific conductance of ground water at some depths in the well varies by up to 50% over a period of about 14 hours. However, these variations were not observed at all depths, or during each pumping cycle. The temperature of ground water in the well was typically between 12.8 and 13.8 C The results of this study indicate that temporal variations in specific conductance of the ground water at this location are caused by an external stress on the aquifer - pumping of a production well approximately 4000 feet away These variations are believed to result from vertical stratification of water quality in the aquifer and a subsequent change in intra well flow related to pumping. When sampling techniques that do not induce a stress on the aquifer (i e thief sampling) are used, knowledge of external stresses on the system at the time of sampling may aid in the interpretation of geochemical data.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199701,iwdl-199701,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,410

"Response of Well-Water Elevations and Spring Discharge to Changes in Barometric Pressure, Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer, Hagerman, Idaho","Rush, James D.; Johnson, Gary S.",2002-11,Hagerman,"42.81, -114.89",hydraulic gradient; groundwater flow; water table fluctuations,"The effect of barometric pressure change on well-water levels was identified in four wells penetrating the Eastern Snake River Plain [ESRP] aquifer between Milner Dam and King Hill, Idaho. Removal of barometric effects on well-water elevations allows measurement of external stresses [such as changes in drawdown during aquifer tests] that could be obscured by well-water fluctuations caused by barometric pressure changes. Multiple-regression deconvolution reveals that the wells penetrate confined aquifers and that well-water levels in one well are affected by wellbore storage or skin effects. Application of a simple linear regression model between barometric pressure and spring discharge at National Fish Hatchery #15, Blind Canyon Springs, and Sand Springs suggests that changes in spring discharge may be independent of barometric pressure. Alternatively, changes in spring discharge are less than the precision of the instruments measuring discharge. Because the hydraulic gradient in parts of the ESRP aquifer is as low as 1 ft per mile [0.0002 ft/ft], the addition of atmospheric head to elevation head should be further evaluated. The use of total head [elevation head plus the atmospheric head component] may increase the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient and change the inferred direction of groundwater flow in parts of the ESRP aquifer.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200205,iwdl-200205,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,413

Five sites were studied in detail with respect to their current conditions and developments, and the potential for future power generation projects: Crane Creek Hot Springs, Raft River, Big Creek Hot Springs, Vulcan Hot Springs KGRA, and the Magic Reservoir Hot Spring area. From this evaluation, Crane Creek Hot Springs was determined to be the best prospect for future development, in light of the current state of private-sector development at the Raft River site. The Vulcan KGRA and Big Creek Hot Springs are considered to be low priority candidates for electrical generation because of their remote locations and other conditions. Additional hydrogeologic information is needed for the Magic Reservoir area to determine the feasibility of a project in this area. In terms of direct use of geothermal fluids, the cities of Cascade and Lava Hot Springs, and the Bruneau Dunes State Park were all determined to be suitable for new developments or expansions to existing developments. Cascade and Lava Hot Springs are prime candidates for district heating programs using geothermal resources. Bruneau Sand Dunes State Park is a prime candidate for the space heating of a proposed interpretive center using an existing geothermal well.

The purpose of flow augmentation has been largely to increase the velocity and/or reduce the temperature of water flowing through mainstem reservoirs in the lower Snake and Columbia Rivers. Although improved adult returns are generally associated with good water years (e.g., high natural flow and spill) during juvenile outmigration, the efficacy of flow augmentation as a substitute for good water years has not been defensibly established. During the period from 1995 through 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Nez Perce Tribe investigated migration characteristics of hatchery-raised, subyearling fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River Basin (Muir et al., 1999). Hatchery raised subyearlings were used as surrogates for wild subyearlings in the survival research. The studies showed that estimated survival from points of release to the tailrace of Lower Granite Dam could be correlated with all three environmental variables examined (flow rate, water temperature, and turbidity). Estimated survival decreased throughout the season, as flow volume and turbidity decreased and water temperature increased (Muir et al., 1999). These correlations have provided the primary basis for the continuation of flow augmentation from reservoirs in the Snake River and Clearwater River Basins (NMFS, 1999). The purpose of this report is to provide a review of the data considered in the Muir et al. (1999) study within the context of determining the efficacy of flow augmentation for enhancing the survival of subyearling fall chinook. In particular, relationships between flow rates, water temperatures, travel times, and estimated survival of hatchery-raised, subyearling fall chinook salmon between points of release and detections at Lower Granite Dam are examined. This report includes analyses of: (1) flow rates and water temperatures at Lower Granite Dam; (2) estimated survival with 5th percentile flow indices; (3) estimated survival and 5th percentile water temperature indices; (4) estimated survival versus release dates; (5) estimated survival versus release groups; and (6) fall chinook travel times and numbers of detections.

This project evaluated the hydrologic characteristics of the Big Wood River and aquifer systems, addressing ground-water characteristics, ground-water/surface-water relationships, and water quality related to on-site sewage disposal systems. Ground water is unconfined and often occurs close to land surface in unconsolidated valley-fill deposits, which range from less than 40 feet to more than 180 feet in thickness. Ground-water underflow at Hailey was calculated to be approximately 40,000 acre-feet per year. A ground-water quality network of approximately 50 wells was established from which samples were collected in July-August, 1983. Approximately 20 wells were then selected from which samples were collected about every 6-8 weeks through March, 1984. The mean concentrations of nitrate-n, chloride, and orthophosphate were 0.53, 2.4, and .013 mg/L, respectively. Nitrate-n concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 2.2 mg/L, well below the USEPA recommended limit of 10 mg/L. The mean specific conductance was 371 micromhos/cm at 25ï¿½ C. Mean concentrations of nitrate-n, chloride, and orthophosphate from surface-water samples were 0.44, 1.8, and .015 mg/L, respectively. Ground-water levels were measured in approximately 60 wells from which a water-table contour map and a ground-water/surface-water profile were constructed for July-August, 1983.

Why improving irrigation efficiency increases total volume of consumptive use,"Contor, Bryce A.; Taylor, R. Garth",2011-04-14,,,irrigation efficiency; water yield improvement; consumptive use; water demand,"This paper's abstract is both in English and in French. The common prescription for dealing with limited supplies of water is to improve irrigation efficiency, that is, to reduce gross delivery to farm fields while maintaining full crop production. The public and some policy makers continue to assume that the water thus saved constitutes a new supply that may be applied to other uses. Scientists and hydrologists have long understood that the non-consumed fraction of applied water often becomes the source for another human or ecosystem purpose after leaving the field, and irrigation improvements interrupt these uses. Thoughtful researchers have provided valuable guidance in conceptual frameworks and analysis procedures to address this issue. Researchers have also noted empirically that total consumptive use often increases when efficiency improves, and have cited case-specific reasons that this occurs. This paper shows it is a general case arising from rational producer behavior in equating the marginal cost of a production input (irrigation water) with its marginal benefit. At any marginal cost of water, improving irrigation efficiency enables the irrigator to be willing and able to purchase a quantity of irrigation water that sustains more consumptive use than was possible with the prior, less-efficient system. An equation for economic demand for water is presented where impacts to both crop yield and commodity price are endogenously determined from simple input data. It is applied to an irrigated area in Idaho, USA where it indicates that improving efficiency from 60 percent to 80 percent reduces field delivery of irrigation water by 15 percent but increases consumptive use by three percent.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201104,iwdl-201104,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2011,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,441

Natural and simulated insect-substrate relationships in Idaho batholith streams,"Sandine, Michael F.",1974-05,,,substrates; flow velocity; benthos,"Laboratory and field studies were conducted to determine the effects of sediments on the distribution and abundance of insects in Idaho Batholith streams. Changes in characteristics of substrate, e.g. dominant substrate, imbeddedness of dominant substrate, composition of material surrounding dominant substrate, and water velocities were correlated with changes in benthic insect populations. Multiple regression analysis indicated benthic populations were not responsive to sediment introduction until the dominant substrate became heavily imbedded. Species diversity was found to be directly correlated with water velocities below 0.35 m per sec. Sediment introduction upon riffles in a natural stream, indicated that rocks greater than 6.5 cm in size contributed most to species diversity of the riffle.

Managed aquifer recharge in the Treasure Valley: a component of a comprehensive aquifer management plan and a response to climate change. Technical completion report 201102,"Contor, B.; Moore, G.; Taylor, S.; Farmer, N.; Owsley, D.; Thiel, S.",2011-02,Treasure Valley,"43.66, -116.6",natural recharge; aquifers; aquifer management,"In a proactive and forward-looking step, the State of Idaho has embarked on a planning process known as the Comprehensive Aquifer Management Plan (CAMP). One of the anticipated drivers of future needs and supply constraints is climate change, and one anticipated response is to provide additional storage capacity to mitigate the effects of altered patterns of runoff from mountain snow pack. Local aquifers can potentially provide additional storage. Managed aquifer recharge means to intentionally place water in the aquifer at times when supplies exceed current needs, for later withdrawal when supplies are short. It may provide storage at lower cost than building new surface-water structures, protects water from evaporation, and does not carry the threat of catastrophic flood from infrastructure failure. Aquifer recharge can also mitigate the potential loss of surface storage capacity due to increased flooding risks posed by climate change. With a robust and active aquifer recharge program, carryover water that is at high risk of being spilled for flood-control purposes can be moved to storage in the aquifer and thereby retained in the basin for future use. This paper provides an initial look at managed recharge, to set the stage and provide context for consideration by participants in the CAMP process. It addresses: (1) Hydrogeology and current aquifer conditions. (2) Potential storage capacity of the Treasure Valley Aquifers available for managed recharge. (3) Location of potential recharge sites. (4) Capacity to deliver water to the recharge sites. (5) Approximate residence time of water stored in the aquifer, before it is depleted by migration to hydraulically-connected surface-water bodies.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201102,iwdl-201102,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2011,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,445

Regression techniques and application of the Universal Soil Loss equation were used in attempts to develop predictive procedures for sediment yield. Measured seasonal sediment yields varied from .34 to 37.0 tons/acre depending on the crop, soil type and field slope. Average sediment and nutrient removal efficiencies for farm settling ponds for an irrigation season varied from 69 to 93 percent for sediment and from 25 to 78 percent for phosphate and nitrogen. A mathematical model was developed as a tool for settling pond design and the model results verified with measured data. Water quality parameters of effluent from four potato fresh pack operations were measured and removal efficiencies determined on four settling facilities. Removal efficiencies of 70 to 90 percent for C.O.D., 63 to 99 percent for suspended solids and 13 to 80 percent for total nitrogen were measured.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-brockway_1976,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,458

In one area, the Snake River Fan of Jefferson County, the irrigation systems and management practices were investigated to determine their contribution to the high water table problem. The investigations showed that the present systems are quite inefficient due to soils with high water intake rates, long irrigation runs and duplication of many irrigation canals. Engineering and economic analyses were made to determine the least cost method of rehabilitating the present system and to determine the capability of the area to support various rehabilitation schemes. Both analyses utilized linear programming models to determine optimum solutions subject to various social and legal constraints. The results obtained indicate that present practices are the most economical for the present cost and availability of water. Wells equipped with high head pumps supplying sprinkler systems appear to be the best alternative if a marked increase in overall irrigation efficiency is to be achieved.

The effects of coarse granitic sediment on the distribution and abundance of salmonids in the central Idaho Batholith,"Klamt, Robert Rudolf",1976-07,,,benthos; bed sediment; population density; riffles; fish; salmonid; trout; salmon,"The effects of coarse granitic sediment on the abundance, distribution, growth, and behavior of juvenile salmonids and the abundance of aquatic insect drift were assessed by adding sediment to artificial and natural stream channels . These data were compared to two natural streams in the central Idaho batholith which already contained large amounts of sediment by correlating fish and insect drift abundance with percentage riffle sediment, riffle size, percentage cover in the pools, and average pool substrate imbeddedness. Densities of juvenile steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri Richardson), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbauum)), and cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki Richardson) in the artificial stream channels decreased as we increased the amount of sediment in the channels. The densities of fish remaining in the channels during the winter tests (water temperature below 5 C) were smaller than in the summer tests (water temperature above 5 C) . Total insect drift density was not affected by the addition . of sediment to the riffles in the artificial streams, but evidence of a community shift to Diptera was observed. Addition of sediment into Knapp Creek reduced fish densities due to loss of cover and pool volume. Insect benthos and drift abundance was not significantly changed. Fish density correlated best with cover and insect drift density in the natural streams studied. Sediment altered the amount and quality of cover in the pools studied.

A.",1976-09,Clearwater River,"46.51, -116.3",hydroelectric power; flow velocity; aquatic insects; population density,"Diel changes in discharge caused by hydroelectric peaking directly affect water levels and velocities and indirectly alter benthos and fish abundance and distribution. The effect of discharge on aquatic insect population below Dworshak Dam on the Clearwater River, Idaho was measured during different peaking regimes. Insects were sampled using a cyclindrical bottom sampler, drift nets, basket samplers and embedded cannisters. The benthic insect community below Dworshak Dam has remained relatively stable during and after the filling of Dworshak Dam but shorelines experiencing daily fluctuations are not readily colonized by stoneflies, mayflies and caddisflies; chironomid midges are the most resilient stranded insects in these unstable areas and the first ones to recolonize the flooded areas. The insects collectively reflected an obvious diel drift pattern with largest numbers drifting at night. Samples selected from three depths (15, 30 and 45 em) yielded the largest numbers of insects at the 45 em depth. When converting numbers of drifting insects to a volume-flow relationship, largest numbers of insects were captured at the 15 em depth. Basket sampling at depths of 1 and 2 m revealed no major differences in the insect community at these depths. A total of 98 species from eight orders of insects were recorded from the Clearwater River. Flows in a diversion channel (3.5 m in width) on the South Fork of the Salmon River were manipulated to experimentally simulate flow fluctuations below a power dam. An upstream section (20m in length) tested insects; a downstream section (60 min length) tested fish at 24-hour sequences of 57, 17, 3 and 51 1/sec. Analysis of vertical distribution of insects in the controlled flow channel indicated that the insects did not generally seek greater interstitial depths during dewatering and that many of the insects had become displaced via drift during the dewatering cycle. Stepwise reduction of discharge caused corresponding reductions in the number of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The carrying capacity of the channel was 250% greater in the summer when salmon were smaller (&lt;59 mm) and stream temperatures were higher (8-17 C) than in the fall when fish were larger (95-102 mm) and temperatures lower (4-15 C). Although the summer and fall carrying capacities differed, the proportion of fish remaining in the channel after each reduction in flow was about the same. The number of chinook in an experimental laboratory flume also changed directly with variation in the rate of flow. These findings corroborated with those for the diversion channel. Extreme reductions in flow significantly increased the amount of insect drift and the rate of ingestion by salmon in the diversion channel.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197610,iwdl-macphee_1976,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,479

Three hundred and six farm operators and 206 absentee landowners were studied. More than half of all farmers use seven of nine potentially helpful practices. However, they are more likely to use those practices that are least costly and troublesome to adopt rather than those known to be most effective. Farmers believe they are doing more to control erosion than self-reported behavior indicates. Greater use of erosion control measures tends to be positively associated with larger farm sizes, higher gross incomes, and higher educational levels. Absentee landownership is an important part of Palouse farming; the average farmer leases 55 percent of the land he farms. Yet there is little interaction between absentee owners and their farm operators. Both owners and operators are strongly concerned about erosion control; however, farmers perceive absentee owners as more resistant to erosion controls than owners perceive themselves.

Upstream, extensive irrigated agriculture has developed, which has resulted in large reductions in the streamflow reaching the dams. Downstream, higher levels of streamflow are sought to benefit navigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat. The power company's desire to retain water in storage, releasing lower flows, is in conflict with the other users' desires to have the downstream releases increased.

We marked or tagged the sturgeon so that we could assess their abundance, growth, distribution and movements. We recaptured 204 of the sturgeon, some up to eight times. Some of the large pools in the Snake River contained more than 200 sturgeon, according to our estimates. By expanding the population estimates we made for several pools in the river, we believe 8,000-12,000 sturgeon resided in the study area during the period 1973-1975. Small sturgeon (less than 3 feet) were the most abundant (86%) of the fish caught. Sturgeon 3-6 feet in length were least abundant (4%) and large fish (over 6 feet in length) comprised 10% of the fish we caught. There was some tendency for the small 2 to 3 foot sturgeon to move downstream, whereas the larger sturgeon did not move far from the original site of capture. Growth of sturgeon produced since dams were constructed in Hells Canyon was less than for sturgeon produced prior to damming of the river. Sturgeon are reproducing successfully in the middle section of the Snake River but the population may not thrive as in past years if the growth rate has indeed slowed and if critical habitat for the rearing of 3-6 foot sturgeon has been eliminated by dams in the lower Snake River",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197708,iwdl-197708,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,491

Pumped storage potential of the Hell's Canyon Area,"Coupe, Larry Douglas",1977-04,Hells Canyon,"45.91, -116.86",water resources development; pumped storage; feasibility studies,"This thesis contains the results of a preliminary investigation of the Hell's Canyon area's potential for pumped storage hydroelectric development, an alternative use of the region's water resource. The concept and application of pumped storage are discussed, particularly as they relate to the Pacific Northwest. An overview of the Hell's Canyon area is presented, focusing on its physical characteristics, history, and current National Recreation Area status. Eighteen potential pumped storage sites are noted, and three of the most promising are selected for more detailed analysis. For the three selected sites, preliminary designs are developed based on characteristics of actual pumped storage projects. Also presented are the results of a computer study of the reservoir water level fluctuations which would be induced by pumped storage operation. The computer program developed for the study is documented in the Appendix. The three sites are analyzed for economic feasibility, based on a procedure developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is concluded that pumped storage in the area is too expensive to be competitive at the present time, but may be feasible in the future. Possible major social and environmental effects are noted, although no actual analysis was performed. The three selected sites are compared, and one (Barber Flat in Idaho) is recommended for further consideration. Two possible alternative uses of pumped storage in the Hell's Canyon area are briefly discussed: (1) the use of pumped storage to relieve Hell's Canyon Dam of objectionable peaking duties; and (2) the use of a pumped storage reservoir to cool a nuclear power plant. On this last point, one site (Bear Creek #1 in Idaho) is recommended for more study.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197709,iwdl-coupe_1977,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,493

Macroinvertebrate biomass and diversity values varied significantly (P&lt;.05) both between different stream orders, and between streams of the same order. Biomass and diversity variability was correlated with physical and chemical factors by stepwise regression analysis. A large percentage (&gt;85%) of the variance in both biomass and diversity was accounted for by changes in four to five physical and chemical factors, which included substrate size, gradient, suspended sediment water temperature, alkalinity, stream order and width. This indicates that predictive modeling of macroinvertebrate community structure is possible in a small, relatively undisturbed watershed. Basket, multiple-plate and Surber macroinvertebrate samplers were used to determine which sampler is most applicable for use in small relatively undisturbed streams. Comparisons were made on the basis of sample biomass) diversity and taxonomic composition. Basket samples had more biomass and higher diversity than multiple-plate samples throughout the watershed, probably because they provided a better imitation of the natural substrate. Basket sample diversities were similar to Surber sample diversities in first and second order streams, but were much lower in third and fourth order streams. Both basket and multiple-plate samplers were found to be adequate for stream survey work. The inconsistancies found with Surber samplers indicated that they were most applicable only when time and resources were at a minimum, or when sampling was designed only to determine which taxa were present at a given site.",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197715,iwdl-197715,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,498

Part of the discriminant procedure was used to choose a set of meteorological factors for each area that can distinguish between frozen and unfrozen ground runoff events. These variables were then used to define a system to classify other past or future runoff events. The occurrence of a frozen ground runoff event is dependent on the combination of several meteorological factors interacting together rather than on the influence of one single variable such as the average minimum air temperature.

Woody",1978-08,Clearwater River,"46.5, -116.69",benthos; dam effects; hydroelectric plants,"A 50 mile (80 km) reach of the Clearwater River, Idaho was studied from its confluence with the Snake River upstream to Orofino, Idaho. The study examined two important changes in the River: 1) effects of hydropower releases from Dworshak Dam on the aquatic insect community in the free flowing reach of the Clearwater River, and 2) backwater effects of Lower Granite Dam on benthos in the lower five miles (8 km) of the Clearwater River. As result of the operational mode of Dworshak Dam, late summer and fall flows are greater than during the pre-project era. Although hydropower releases cause frequent and marked fluctuations in discharge, there is a stable post project low flow. This higher late summer flow guarantees the submergence of additional substrate, thereby increasing macrobenthic habitat. Over 120 species of aquatic insects exclusive of Chironomidae have been collected from the Clearwater  River. While small to moderate shifts in seasonal densities of principal species have occurred between intensive study sites above and below the influence of Dworshak Dam, present evidence does not indicate these shifts are attributable to hydropower releases. Approximately one month was required for sterile rocks to support a standing crop similar to that of continually watered rocks. In most instances, numbers of species and densities increased with increasing depth of 15, 30 and 45 cm. Numbers of drifting insects were greatest during the nights. Drift rates and standing crop relationships above and below the influence of Dworshak Dam suggest insects drifted more in response to daily fluctuations than to the factor of bottom density. Within the lower five miles of the Clearwater, variable backwater effects of Lower Granite Reservoir have a far more pronounced effect on the amount of potential benthic habitat available than do releases from Dworshak Dam. Formation of Lower Granite reservoir has resulted in insect community shifts from a riverine to a lentic community as a result of physical changes in water depth, velocity and substrate with dipteran midges the dominant insect group.",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197803,iwdl-197803,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,501

It is used in determining total irrigation water requirements and in sizing the irrigation system components. Irrigation efficiency is not a deterministic parameter; the occurrence and sequencing cannot be predicted with complete reliability. Realistically, it is a probabilistic phenomenon subject to large spatial and time variabilities, and hence uncertain. A Bayesian decision theory optimization model was developed that explicitly incorporated the uncertainties inherently associated with the probabilistic hydrologic and irrigation efficiency phenomena. Specifically, the model selected that optimum acreage to be seasonally committed to irrigation, controlled by those probabilistic events in conjunction with the irrigators' risk and uncertainty response characteristics. The developed model was applied to the Wood River Valley Irrigation District No. 45, located in Blaine County, Idaho. Major inputs into the model included stochastic irrigation diversions, probabilistic irrigation efficiency regimes, three crop response functions, utility functions, irrigated crop production cost and crop price functions, consumptive use and seasonal crop yield coefficients.

A history of the area and issues involved has necessarily been presented. Once the considerations have been identified, a subjective analysis follows, discussing the interrelationship between paired considerations. A scaling has been made of the impact of one consideration on another consideration in a positive or negative sense. A novel graphic matrix has been used to present the interrelationship between considerations. The overall impact of these considerations on the State of Idaho, the Pacific Northwest region and the nation has been presented along with a spectrum of possible options for planning for development and conservation of the water resources of the Hells Canyon reach of the Snake River. An extensive bibliography of related information has also been compiled for reference.

"Simulation of soil erosion in the Palouse. Research technical completion report, project A-047-IDA","Yoo, Kyung Hak",1978-06,Palouse,"46.74, -117.24",hydrologic models; rill erosion; erosion control; watershed models,"A soil erosion simulation study was done to help understand the severe soil loss from agricultural lands in the Palouse Prairie of the Pacific Northwest. A soil erosion model was coupled with the Idaho version of the USDAHL watershed model which supplied primary information such as rainfall, snowfall, snowmelt, overland flow, stream flow, soil moisture and crop growth index to the erosion model. The main factors used by the erosion model are: overland flow, rainfall, snowmelt, snow covered area, organic material covered area, soil moisture, rill development on upland areas and stream flow for channel scouring. These are used to calculate soil particle detachment and transport capacity of raindrop and overland flow. There are several coefficients which are used to estimate the conditions for or against soil erosion. This first generation Palouse erosion model was fitted to measured sediment discharge by using trial-and-error techniques. The model was tested on two different size watersheds (3.3 hectare and 59.4 hectare) near Moscow, Idaho. The results showed poor simulation on a daily basis. The monthly and yearly simulations were good compared with the observed except for the period of high stream flow simulated at the start of the water year. The eroded particles from each hydrologic zone cascades to a lower zone and finally to the channel. This cascading system shows the amount and location in terms of zones, where the erosion and deposition occur. Rill depth and distribution for any erosion period are the most important part of the model since rill erosion is calculated as a function of them. From field measurements rill erosion has proven to be one of the most serious erosion sources in the Palouse. Channel scouring erosion is not as significant as upland erosion. High stream flow does not necessarily cause high soil loss and vice versa. Many of the problems, particularly with upland erosion, can be traced to inadequacies in the hydrologic model. This is the first study of its type in the Palouse area. There must be further calibration and modification of both the hydrologic and erosion model in order to improve the simulation of erosion in this area.",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197815,iwdl-197815,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,511

Water budget components were measured for the 1975-76 irrigation season on the 30,000 acre area for calibration of the model. Both water table and confined aquifers were simulated. Simulated groundwater levels and spring flows were determined for several projected changes in land use including canal lining programs, subdivision development, conversion to sprinkler irrigation, groundwater development and for irrigation and artificial recharge. Severe decreases of up to 38 percent in the discharge of Silver Creek, a productive spring fed trout stream, were projected. Groundwater levels in the water table and artesian aquifers could decline up to 16 feet. The most severe impacts will result from conversion of present flood end furrow irrigated land to sprinkler irrigation with attendant decrease in aquifer recharge. The 1977 drought, during which irrigation diversions were only 28% of the 1975 diversions, was simulated and compared with measured data.

Four sets of activities are measured. These are: (1) fishing, boating, swimming, hiking, camping, and picnicking; (2) dock fishing, boat fishing and shore fishing; (3) water skiing, motorboat fishing, and motorboating (for Pleasure); and (4) canoeing, sailboating, and motorboating. Preference scales for each set are compared between: (1) corrected and uncorrected for length of stay bias, (2) all respondents and only transitive respondents; and (3) all respondents and only those respondents who participated in both activities of the pair being compared. Preference rankings within a set sometimes vary with the criteria. For the activity set fishing, boating, swimming, hiking, camping and picnicking the mean proportions of respondents and percentage of respondents selecting that activity are related to the percentage of management funds being spent on that activity area to derive a preference-cost ratio. These ratios were computed for all respondents, both corrected and uncorrected for length of stay bias; and head of party, both all respondents and those who participated in both activities of the pair. The number of participants is multiplied by the ratios to obtain weighted values. Boating was ranked first, and hiking was ranked second. Other activities in decreasing rank order are fishing, swimming, picnicking, and camping. The preference-cost ratios identify where unequal resource allocations are occurring.

Finally, the potential and effects on peak demands, the use of hydroelectric capacity and hence seasonal reservoir fluctuations are examined. The study finds that time-of-day pricing may not be desirable for residential and commercial customers in Northern Idaho. Industrial customers would clearly benefit.

Information on project administration, operation and maintenance costs were gathered for years 1974, 1975, and 1976, and water diversions, deliveries and losses were measured or estimated for the 1977 irrigation season. These data were analyzed using procedures which expressed water costs and water used efficiencies uniformly for all projects studied. Highly significant relationships existed between selected 0 & M cost to water use data and physical characteristics of project systems. Characteristics of conveyance, application and diversion systems varied considerably among projects. Annual project operating costs, including costs for electrical power, ranged from $1.85 to $61.40 per acre and irrigation efficiencies ranged from 12 percent to 59 percent for the 1977 season.

Review of alternative energy sources for irrigation use in Idaho,"Warnick, C.C.",1979-06,,,electric power demand; hydroelectric power; irrigation requirements,Alternative electrical energy sources for meeting the power needs of irrigated agriculture in Idaho are discussed in light of present energy restraints and the escalation in prices of non-renewable fuels for energy production. Six alternatives have been identified that involve renewable energy sources and three non-renewable sources are suggested. A brief explanation is made of how each of these alternatives function in producing electrical power suitable for serving irrigated agriculture. An assessment of the technical feasibility in Idaho's irrigated agricultural region of these various alternative energy sources is made and a presentation is likewise made of the social and political acceptability of each of the alternatives to serve as a source of power for irrigation pumping as conditions exist in 1979. Finally an estimate is made of the cost of producing electrical energy for irrigation operations in Idaho for each alternative to indicate possible choices of the future. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations made to encourage development of the most promising alternatives that might meet the conservation needs of the state and meet possible new load growth that now appears to be facing those involved in irrigated agriculture.,IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,197928,iwdl-warnick_1979,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2012,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.1 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",wbv,,539

Because streams had not been studied for small scale hydro development a survey was needed to determine the potential energy available in the streams of the State. Through this study a new technique was developed for finding flow duration information along reaches of natural streams that did not have streamflow records. In addition a method of estimating flow duration curves for regulated streams ,was developed. With these techniques a survey was made of the theoretical energy potential in the streams of the State of Idaho. This was first done on a reach by reach basis and then the hydrologic data generated for the reach analysis was used to estimate power potential at existing dams, all proposed power sites and certain power possiblities in irrigation systems. A summary of the results of the hydro survey for Idaho is included in this report. Subsequently the study was expanded with the help of neighboring state water centers to cover the entire Pacific Northwest region of the United States. A preliminary social, political and environmental feasibility analysis was also made to identify the reaches wherein favorable action toward implementation could be expected.

Estimating tributary basin underflow to the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. Technical completion report 201103,Enhanced Snake Plain Aquifer model final report. Technical report 06-002. ESPAM scenario document DDM-019,2011,,,aquifers; pumpage; water demand; natural recharge; water budget,"While groundwater withdrawals in the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer increase, the number of recharge sources to the aquifer remains the same. These sources of recharge include precipitation, stream and river losses, irrigation percolation, canal seepage, and subsurface flow from tributary basins. Most sources of recharge can be measured or closely approximated since they occur on the surface. However, flow that is underground from surrounding basins (also called tributary underflow) is much more difficult to quantify since it occurs beneath the surface. The Eastern Snake River Plain is surrounded by 23 tributary basins and is believed to receive recharge from each one. Tributary underflow is a key component of recharge in the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer Model, representing approximately 20 percent of the water budget.  Several techniques have been developed to estimate underflow from tributary basins of the Eastern Snake Plain. This investigation pursues use of the Langbein method, published in a report on the Raft River Basin by Nace et al. (1961). The Langbein method estimates water yield for a basin based on relationships between temperature and potential evapotranspiration. Water yield for a basin is the manageable part of the water supply that is potentially available for consumptive use. Improved methods of estimating precipitation and temperature data have become available since the Langbein studies were completed. For the Eastern Snake Plain tributary basins, resulting values of basin yield were partitioned to three fates: irrigation ET, surface outflow, and tributary underflow. Tributary underflow was calculated as the difference between basin yield and water leaving the basin as streamflow and ET from irrigated lands.  Tributary underflow was calculated annually for each basin as a depth and a volume for 1980-2009. Results showed that some estimates may have been incorrect and potential sources of error were reviewed. When quality streamflow data were present for a basin, calculated values of underflow appeared reasonable. It was assumed that all basins discussed contribute some underflow to the Eastern Snake Plain, thus negative values may indicate a temporary cessation of underflow or an error in the calculation.  While the Langbein method has been previously used to estimate basin yield in basins tributary to the Eastern Snake River Plain (Little Lost, Raft), this work suggests the values for basin yield may be underestimated and the method of choice not be optimal for use in an arid climate. Other potential concerns for estimating underflow from basin yield are related to the limited information for streamflow and imprecision in the application of METRIC ET data. For future studies of basin yield, each individual basin should be analyzed based on the amount of information available for that basin and the type of climate.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Idaho Department of Water Resources; IDWR,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201103,iwdl-201103,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2011,"GPL Ghostscript 8.15, version 1.5 (Acrobat 6.x), 1,933,098 bytes",jh,,541
Hydro-economic modeling of Boise Basin water management responses to climate change.

Three hydro-economic modeling scenarios are developed. The first estimates the affects of projected climate change water shortages on the basin-wide economic benefit in the Lower Boise River Basin. The next two are representative of typical demand management and supply management responses to climate change; respectively, introduction of new canal lining conservation measures or new reservoir storage. Boise Project groundwater and drain return response zones in the lower basin are identified and marginal demand-price and supply-cost functions are developed for Project canal irrigators and non-Project groundwater and drain water irrigators using river/reservoir and groundwater hydrologic model response data. Flood flow probability and damage functions are used to develop marginal utility functions for new flood control storage. Irrigation and flood control demands are not requirements. All demand functions are developed assuming demand-price elasticity. The base-case equilibrium price-quantity positions and consumer surpluses of Project and non-Project irrigators are calculated using a partial equilibrium (PE) economic model in which all factors of production except for water are held fixed. Subsequent PE model scenarios impose varying climate constraints on irrigation water supplies, along with a progression of new Boise Project canal lining conservation measures, and/or the addition of new Boise River reservoir storage. Rival demand is assumed to exist for new storage, which can be released prior to April 1 to meet demand for flood control, or after April 1 as natural flow to meet demand for irrigation. Preliminary Reclamation and Corp of Engineers construction cost estimates for new Boise Project canal lining and new reservoir storage are used calculate benefit-cost ratios, in which net basin-wide benefits of alternative responses to climate change are derived from hydro-economic modeling.",Boise Basin,IWRRI Technical Completion Report,,IWRRI,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201301,iwdl-201301,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2014-02-04,"Microsoft Word 2010, version 1.5 (Acrobat 6.x) 1,377,135 bytes",Jodi Haire,,542

Previous work has suggested that these relationships appear nearly linear but frequently are inconsistent with field observations of spring elevation. The purpose of this report is to document recently collected spring discharge and nearby aquifer water-level data and further evaluate the relationship between these measurements.  Spring discharge is compared to aquifer water levels for 14 spring-well pairs. In most cases, the relationship between the spring discharge and well water level is approximately linear within the limited data range. In a few cases, either spring discharge or well water level exhibits atypical behavior and the linearity is diminished. This may be due to local recharge and discharge activities near either the spring or well. Extrapolation of the relationships consistently indicates that spring elevation should be higher than that observed in the field (the x-axis intercept). This implies that a non-linear relationship may exist below the data range observed, or that systematic errors were encountered in measurement of spring discharge or aquifer water level. Non-linearity at lower spring discharges could be due to unconfined aquifer conditions or other unknown phenomena.",IWRRI,IWRRI Technical Completion Report,,IWRRI; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute,University of Idaho,eng,200501,iwdl-200501,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2014,"Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows), PDF version 1.3 (Acrobat 4.x), 1,573,648 bytes",jh,,543

Hydro-economic modeling can be traced back to the use of water demand curves developed in the 1960s and 1970s by Jacob Bear and others.  Most hydro-economic models share basic elements including spatial representation of hydrologic flows, water supply infrastructure, supply costs and constraints, economic demands, and operating rules affecting water allocations.  Basin-wide hydro-economic model application involves five basic steps:  1. Development of a node-arc model framework incorporating water suppliers and demanders as nodes, and supply and demand linkages as arcs.   2. Development of marginal water supply-cost and demand-price functions for supply and demand nodes, and conveyance-cost functions for model arcs.  3. Calibration of the baseline model using basin hydrologic and water budget data.   4. Development of model scenarios by modifying baseline model variables to represent alternative water resources plans.   5.  Evaluation of scenario results to generate policy insights and reveal opportunities for improved water resource planning.   Two basic approaches exist for hydro-economic modeling.  The holistic approach combines hydrology and economic optimization into a single model.  The modular approach involves a transfer of exogenous supply and demand information from an independent hydrologic model to an economic optimization model.  For basin scale studies, the modular approach is generally preferred because it allows for more robust and realistic representation of basin hydrology and more efficient optimization of a basin-wide network of water supply and demand nodes.",IWRRI,IWRRI Technical Completion Report,,"Tracy, John",Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201401,iwdl-201401,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2014-10-07,"Canon iR-ADV 6055, Adobe PSL1.1 e for Canon; PDFversion 1.6 (Acrobat 7.x), 1,417,224 bytes",jh,,544
An approach to hydro-economic modeling using partial equilibrium optimization.

More specifically, under the conventional approach to water management, which can be referred to as the supply management approach, the value of water is based upon the amount of compensation necessary to recover distribution costs (O&M, infrastructure, construction, etc.) with water demand forecasts assumed to be static and not affected by the cost of the supplied water. The demand management approach, on the other hand assumes that the costs associated with developing and delivering water supplies is invariant, and focuses on the value of water relative to the amount of water demand and controlling factors such as regulation, conservation, and availability of infrastructure. By ignoring how the demand for water changes as a result of changes in price and ignoring the change in cost associated with supplying greater amounts of water (referred to as the price/cost elasticity), both of these conventional approaches to water management fall short in their ability to adequately inform the development of effective water management strategies.   Hydro-economic analysis presents an alternative to the Demand Management and Supply Management approaches. This type of analysis utilizes economic concepts to understand how the supply and demand for water are affected by changes in the cost of developing and delivering water supplies and how the demand for these water supplies is based on the value that can be derived from the water by the water users (ie crop value). This approach moves away from a static view with a fixed and invariant water demand, to a view where the demand for water is related to the economic concept of ""value"".  Use of an economic approach in water management and planning, particularly under conditions where water is a scarce resource, enhances the ability to develop management alternatives that are based on an efficient and equitable use of water, thereby reducing wasteful practices at both the individual and institutional scale. Given that the value of water changes with both quantity and type of use, understanding the economic costs and benefits associated with meeting the demand for water resources allows for a more effective comparison of water management alternatives. Hydro-economic analysis provides a framework for incorporating multiple-, and often competing-, objectives (ie water supply, flood control, hydropower, recreation, ecosystem requirements, etc) into a single analysis. By translatingthe value of each objective (or hydro-service) into its respective economic benefit, hydro-economic analysis allows for a direct evaluation of the economic efficacy of competing water management alternatives. Such an approach allows for a more holistic evaluation of water resource management actions, resulting in the development of more effective and sustainable water management strategies, and in turn reducing the likelihood of undesirable outcomes or unsustainable plan.",IWRRI,IWRRI Technical Completion Report,,United States Bureau of Reclamation,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201402,iwdl-201402,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2014-11-12,"Microsoft Word 2010, 1.5 (Acrobat 6.x), 1,747,648 bytes",jh,,545

In 2014, the Idaho Legislature appropriated $500,000 to the Idaho Water Resources Board (IWRB) ""to conduct joint water need studies in coordination with Northern Idaho communities to ensure water availability for future economic development"". The Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRI) was contracted to conduct the studies and report to IWRB and RPA municipal providers. The goal of the contract and this report is to provide underlying information necessary to support potential Reasonably Anticipated Future Need (RAFN) water right applications from RPA municipal providers.  Idaho Code authorizes municipal water providers to hold RAFN water rights to provide for future growth and economic development. There are four components of an application for a RAFN right: delineation of the future service area, a planning horizon, a future water demand projection, and a water right gap analysis to determine the extent of the RAFN right to be applied for.  Approximately 85,000 acre foot (AF) annually is withdrawn from the RPA for municipal, domestic, commercial, industrial, and agricultural use. Of that, 36,400 AF is withdrawn by RPA municipal providers with eleven providers supplying water to 95% of the RP population. Ten providers anticipate either applying for RAFN rights, or identified potential service area overlaps with other providers. After mediated resolution of overlaps and terms of service, a Memorandum of Understanding identifying future RPA municipal water provider service areas was negotiated and signed by all ten municipal providers.  Population served by the eleven major RPA municipal providers is projected to increase by 87,671 over the 30-year planning horizon. The area served will increase from 78.9 square miles to 156.9 square miles. Relatively low to medium density (&lt;1-4 units/acre) development of both ACI and rural areas is likely to constitute roughly 80-85% of new residential development. Existing cities and their Areas of City Impacts (ACI), along with urban reserves, will likely see a small amount (up to 5%) of higher intensity, compact development both within the city centers and at nodes along existing arterial and collector corridors within ACIs and in rural portions of the county. The Maximum Daily Demand will increase by 61.53 cfs, and the Peak Hourly Demand will increase by 171.81 cfs. RAFN rights totaling 58.86 cfs are required to meet the 2045 MDD of five RPA municipal providers. The  rights are offset by a decrease of 103.74 in MDD required rights among six other RPA municipal providers. RAFN rights totaling 264.69 cfs are required to meet the 2045 PHD of ten RPA municipal providers. The RAFN rights are offset by a decrease of 32.86 cfs in PHD required rights for one RPA municipal provider.

"Water resources data and management model for Beaver Creek, Camas Creek and Mud Lake area of eastern Idaho. Research technical completion report","Brockway, C. E.; Robison, Clarence Wm.",1988-11-15,Beaver Creek; Camas Creek; Mud Lake; Warm Creek; Eastern Idaho,"43.906894, -112.384987",water resources data; water management; Model studies; water balance model; artesian aquifers; Pumped storage; irrigation; water allocation; hydrology; computer models; mathematical models,"Mud Lake, a natural closed basin in eastern Idaho, is used as a reservoir for storage of irrigation water. Mud Lake has been modified by the construction of dikes and levies to provide storage of approximately 64,200 acre feet. The water supply is furnished by surface runoff from Beaver Creek and Camas Creek and by artesian and pumped wells from the Snake Plain Aquifer. Beaver Creek, with a drainage area of approximately 510 square miles is tributary to Camas Creek at a point near Camas, Idaho, and normally dries up in late spring. There are irrigation diversions on Beaver Creek above Camas Creek serving approximately 5,800 acres. The topography of the Beaver Creek drainage confines the stream except for the lower reach just above Camas.  Camas Creek originates in the Beaverhead mountains and irrigates approximately 8,100 acres above Camas. Major tributaries are West Camas, East Camas, and Beaver Creeks. A dam was constructed on Camas Creek near Lone Tree but is not currently functioning. The diversion structure at Lone Tree is capable of diverting approximately 1000 cfs into the basalt and lava flows east of Camas Creek. This diversion has been used in the past to divert flood flows from Camas Creek which then sink into the fractured basalt. Another main diversion from Camas Creek is the Warm Creek channel through which up to 200 cfs can be diverted in the NE 1/4 SW 1/4 Sec 28 T 8N R 36E.  Flows in Warm Creek fill depressions and ponds in the upper areas of the wildlife refuge, with the remainder returning to the Camas Creek channel. Camas Creek drains an area of approximately 1130 square miles above Mud Lake and flows through the Camas Wildlife Refuge into Mud Lake through a regulating structure called the Bybee gates or Bybee structure. The gates at the Bybee structure can be closed to retain Camas Creek discharge in the refuge area or opened to fill Mud Lake. Rays Lake, within the Camas Wildlife Refuge, is served by Camas Creek and also serves as a reservoir for irrigation pumping for lands to the south of Camas Creek. Also within the Camas Wildlife Refuge are numerous artesian and pumped wells which are used by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain water levels in the surface ponds.  Artesian flow from wells is collected in ditches and transported to Mud Lake during both the winter and irrigation periods. These wells are generally shallow wells penetrating the basalts of the Snake Plain Aquifer which is partially confined in the area just north and east of Mud Lake. The primary groups of users which utilize well water are the Independent Water Users, the Owsley Canal, and the Holly Water Users. Normally, these wells flow under artesian conditions in the winter and spring and are pumped after the irrigation season begins; however, the wells are pumped during late winter and spring during low water years. During years when flood conditions are imminent, these wells can be, and have been, capped to reduce inflow into Mud Lake.  Mud Lake and the watersheds of Beaver Creek and Camas Creek are administered by Water District 66. The watermaster for this district is Mr. Don Shenton, who has held that position since 1960. During the irrigation season, the watermaster allocates water according to a federal decree which includes all water users.  Because of the relationships between surface water and ground-water systems and the complicated operation of artesian well systems, evaluation of the effects of changes in surface flows or utilization of wells on Mud Lake is not possible without a computer based water balance model. In order to evaluate the efficiency and/or impacts of possible flood control measures on Mud Lake, a simplified water balance model of the system was developed.",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198802,iwdl-198802,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2015-02-26,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Paper capture plug-in, 3,477,528 bytes  Archival Master file is a TIFF",jh,,547

Research Technical Completion Report","Frederick, David B.; Johnson, Gary S.",1996-01,Snake River Plain; Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,,hydraulic properties; hydraulic models; Snake River; Aquifer characteristics; groundwater flow; wells; models,"The Idaho INEL Oversight Program, in association with the University of Idaho, Idaho Geological Survey, Boise State University, and Idaho State University, developed a research program to determine the hydraulic properties of the Snake River Plain aquifer and characterize the vertical distribution of contaminants. A straddle-packer was deployed in four observation wells near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Pressure transducers mounted in the straddle-packer assembly were used to monitor the response of the Snake River Plain aquifer to pumping at the ICPP production wells, located 2600 to 4200 feet from the observation wells. The time-drawdown data from these tests were used to evaluate various conceptual models of the aquifer.  Aquifer properties were estimated by matching time-drawdown data to type curves for partially penetrating wells in an unconfined aquifer. This approach assumes a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer. The hydraulic properties of the aquifer obtained from the type curve analyses were:   Storativity = 3 x 10""; Specific Yield = 0.01; Transmissivity = 740 ft2/min; Anisotropy (Kv:Kh)= 1: 360  Further evaluation of the time-drawdown data collected at various depth intervals in the aquifer indicated that drawdown generally increased with depth. Time-drawdown data were compared to the stratigraphy of the basalt flows and sedimentary interbeds at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory developed by Anderson (1991). The greatest drawdown was observed in tested intervals below the top of Flow Group I.  To evaluate the implications of this observation, a radial flow model was used to simulate three conceptual models for the Snake River Plain aquifer near the Idaho Chemical Processing  Plant:  1) One Layer System: Single aquifer - Flow Groups E-I (homogeneous and anisotropic)  2) Two Layer System: Upper aquifer - Flow Groups E-G (homogeneous and anisotropic)  Lower aquifer - Flow Group I (homogeneous and anisotropic)   3) Three Layer System: Upper aquifer - Flow Groups E-G (homogeneous and anisotropic)  Confining unit - sedimentary interbed at the top of Flow Group I (homogeneous and isotropic)  Lower aquifer - Flow Group I (homogeneous and anisotropic).  The three-layer system, in which the upper 70 feet of the aquifer is unconfined, the sedimentary interbed at the top of Flow Group I is a leaky confining layer, and the basalt units in Flow Group I represent a leaky confined aquifer, provided the best match of simulated drawdown to observed drawdown. Estimates of the hydraulic properties of each layer were determined by trial and error model calibration. This optimization resulted in the following average estimates for the hydraulic properties of  the composite, three-layer system:  Storativity = 7 x 10""; Specific Yield = 0.009; Transmissivity = 430 ft2/min; Anisotropy (Kv:Kh)= 1:230  The estimated hydraulic properties for each of the three layers are as follows:  1) Upper aquifer (unconfined)--Horizontal conductivity = 3.7 ft/min; Vertical conductivity = 0.3 ft/min  2) Confining layer (leaky)--Horizontal conductivity = 1.4 x ft/min; Vertical conductivity = 1.4 x lo4 ft/min  3) Lower aquifer (leaky, confined)--Horizontal conductivity = 0.6 ft/min; Vertical conductivity = 0.4 ft/min  Calibration of the radial flow model and type curve analysis resulted in similar estimates of the hydraulic properties of the aquifer system, despite major differences in the conceptual models (i.e. one layer versus three layers).  For aquifer characterization studies with less quantitative objectives, such as an evaluation of an area's water supply potential, type-curve analysis may be adequate. However, for more complex needs, such as contaminant-transport modeling, it may be necessary to refine the conceptual model and corresponding estimates of the hydraulic properties.",IWRRI,IWRRI Technical Completion Report,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI; Idaho National Engineering Laboratory; State of Idaho INEL Oversight Program,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199607,iwdl-199607,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2015-06-02,"300 ppi, Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Paper capture plug-in, 4,233,614 bytes; Archival Master file is a TIFF",jh,,548

In automated aquifer model calibration, investigators may instruct the software to attempt improvement in meeting calibration targets by adjusting specified input data. For the Non-irrigated Lands recharge data set, the desire was to give the calibration team the capability to multiply the depth of recharge by a specified factor. It was felt that it would be desirable to identify zones which could be assigned to different multipliers. Since the non-irrigated recharge calculation is based upon generalized soil type, it was desired to associate the zones for multipliers with regions of similar general soil characteristics.

Rathdrum Prairie integrated water resource management,"Solomon, Mark",2016-04-27,Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer; Spokane River,,Water policy; Water quality; Water demand; Pollution load; Municipal water; Municipal wastewater; residential wastewater; aquifer evaluation; Aquifer characteristics;,"The Rathdrum Prairie Integrated Water Resource Management plan is a living document to be revisited,  reviewed and updated as new information becomes available and as community water resource needs and objectives change. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) planning is most often conducted to balance future demands on water supply among various user groups reliant on the same water source(s). On the Rathdrum Prairie (RP), an additional significant constraint presents itself: water quality. As described in detail in Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer Future Municipal Water Demand, future RP demand is driven by growth in municipal use and consequent decrease in agricultural irrigation as cropped land is converted to residential and commercial use. A potential constraint on municipal growth and demand is the vulnerability of the Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer (RPA) and the Spokane River to pollutant loading. An additional constraint on RPA use is political in nature: effects of RPA withdrawals on aquifer discharge to the Spokane River down-gradient in Washington State. This IWRM plan will analyze the interactions between RP municipal growth and the physical, regulatory and sociopolitical constraints on RPA municipal water demand.  The RPIWRM is based on three reports created for the IWRM planning process: the Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer Future Municipal Water Demand, an update to the Rathdrum Prairie Wastewater Master Plan  (Appendix A), and a municipal wastewater industrial reuse report (Appendix B). Additional analysis includes river management, municipal stormwater discharge and infiltration, and on-site residential wastewater disposal. The IWRM is informed and set in the context of local land use planning and water quality regulation.  Integrated water resource management analysis indicates:  ""¢ RPA water supply is sufficient to meet projected demand  ""¢ Existing municipal wastewater treatment plants have or are building sufficient capacity to handle predicted growth within the Area of City Impacts for Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls, Rathdrum and Hayden for current regulated pollutants  ""¢ Addition of PCBs or other constituents of emerging concern (CEC) to pollutants regulated by Spokane  River Municipal Wastewater Treatment (MWWT) NPDES permits may drive institution of seasonal land application as the final disposal option for MWW effluent  ""¢ Population expansion and attendant increase in water demand predicted for the Greenferry Water and Sewer District south of Post Falls is unlikely to occur without appropriate wastewater treatment options  ""¢ Population expansion predicted for North Kootenai Water and Sewer District north of Hayden may be delayed by difficulty in changing land use zoning to support higher density development  ""¢ Industrial reuse of treated MWW is feasible but unlikely unless the regulatory environment or water supply availability changes  ""¢ Legislative clarification of 42-201(8) is necessary to clearly identify that industrial reuse of MWW effluent is automatically permitted as a water right  ""¢ The volume of stormwater discharge to surface water will decrease  ""¢ Infiltration of stormwater runoff is not significantly decreasing RPA water quality  ""¢ Critical low flows in the Spokane River at the Spokane gage will be only marginally affected by water use and discharge flows on/from the Rathdrum Prairie  ""¢ Effective IWRM for the RPA necessitates extension of IWRM to include the interests of Washington  State, the Spokane Tribe, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, and Avista Corporation",IWRRI,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201501,iwdl-201501,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2016-06-01,"Adobe Acrobat Pro 11.0.15; PDFversion 1.6 (Acrobat 7.x), 8,407,003 bytes",jh,,551

Primary use was made of flow duration procedures. Past streamflow gaging records were used to evaluate the variation  over time as well as the variation of simultaneous measurements at different sites. Methodologies were developed for determining the low flow percentage exceedance values at an ungaged site using a  single streamflow measurement coupled with knowing the exceedance percentages at gaged streamflow sites in the area. A major contribution of this methodology is a means of estimating the confidence bounds of the estimates made.

The first portion of the report is the development of a hydrologic management classification of basins tributary to the upper Snake River. The last part of the report is a legal examination of the uncertainties and complexities of conjunctive management of surface and ground water under the appropriation  doctrine. Eleven basins tributary to the upper Snake River were selected for detailed study based upon existing data: Little Lost River, Big Lost River, Big Wood River-Silver Creek, Camas Prairie, Portneuf River,  Michaud Flats, Rockland, Raft River, Rock Creek-Goose Creek, Salmon Falls Creek and Blue Gulch.   Most of the south side tributary valleys have either existing or potential overdevelopment problems.  Calculation of time lag estimates between pumpage in a tributary basin and impact on the Snake River are based upon lag times within the individual basins as well as the Snake Plain aquifer, if appropriate. Several basins have estimated lag times of more than 100 years.  The legal uncertainties and complexities of conjunctive management examined as part of this study  include: questions involving the magnitude and timing of the impact of junior tributary diversions upon supplies in the main source, both in private litigation between water users and in administrative regulation of water use; selection of junior tributary diversions for closure when senior appropriators on the main source are not receiving their full supplies; questions of burden of proof both in private litigation and in administrative regulation; and the influence of policy objectives upon conjunctive management decisions. A number of more or less technical legal issues are identified and discussed. Where Idaho law gives little guidance, comparison is made to legal developments in Colorado. The study also focuses on a fundamental and difficult policy issue that may arise in a number of conjunctive management situations, conflict between the policies of vested rights and optimum development.",IWRRI,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; IWRRI,University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198410,iwdl-198410,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2016-12-14,"Fujitsu fi-5750C image scanner, Adobe Acrobat 10.1.16 Paper capture plug-in, Archival Master file is a TIFF",jh,,553

While some farmers changed crops and varieties or idled land in anticipation of water shortage, the majority proceeded with normal cropping patterns. When water shortage occurred, the result was reduced yield, or in some cases complete loss of the crop.  These yield declines and lost crops comprised the largest part of the economic impact of the drought. Results suggest, however, that water was managed much more efficiently than usual during the summer of 1977. Many crops got less water but didn't suffer corresponding yield declines. Some of this resulted from better water management, and from improvements in applications systems. Many delivery organizations responded to water shortage by implementing delivery rotation programs.

They hold their cattle in semi-confinement areas during the winter where they are normally fed hay. The holding area is often the land upon which the hay was grown during the summer. This land is often alongside a stream and considered a potential source of non-point pollution for that stream. This study was established to quantify the amount of pollutant loss from cow-calf winter feeding operations and to examine the possibility that one hay crop on the land may retain more pollutants from the runoff water than another. Three ground cover (hay crop) treatments with two replications were established using an alfalfa and grass mixture. The mixtures were those used by ranchers in Owyhee County, Idaho, the location of the test plots. Grasses used with the alfalfa were brome, fescue and orchard grass. After the plots were established in 1979, cattle were placed on them each winter and removed each spring for the next three years. The plots were irrigated twice each year. Irrigation and runoff flows were monitored and water samples taken for analysis.

Statistical models were developed using multiple regression techniques. Required inputs included evapotranspiration, precipitation, weekly variation of water use, previous diversions and dummy variables used to account for monthly and seasonal variations of soil moisture management. Predictions from the statistical model followed actual diversions quite closely for three irrigation seasons. It was concluded that the statistical models were superior to the physical modeling approach for predicting irrigation diversions.",Boise Basin,,,,Idaho Water and Energy Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198308,iwdl-198308,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-08-28,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,198308.pdf,586

These models can provide useful information on variable significance to systems functioning, thereby directing research resources into areas which will most benefit further understanding of the system. Furthermore, as aquaculture systems research progresses, the composite model can be modified to incorporate new technology. Modeling, therefore, is a cyclic process -- a means for understanding the system, for evaluating the system, and for using the model to incorporate the new technology. This computer-implemented mathematical model addresses one of the significant limitations of aquaculture systems management, namely, production forecasting, by providing a method of using current technology to predict Allowable Growth Rate (AGR).

St. Helens in southwestern Washington on May 18, 1980 deposited a plume of volcanic ash from Washington to western Montana. Ash deposits in northern Idaho were significant with depths varying from 2 to 3 mm in the fringes to as much as 50 mm in the central area of the plume as it crossed the Idaho panhandle. Varying amounts of the ash were deposited directly in streams located in the plume area. This study is an evaluation of the changes in the in-stream ecological conditions resulting from volcanic ash deposition and transport. This interdisciplinary evaluation of the in-stream effects of the new volcanic ash deposition in the physical and biotic components of streams in the ashfall plume area was studied by recreating, on a simulated basis, condition prior to, during, and after the ash deposition, and by field verification measurements taken in the Palouse River to support the simulation studies. The results obtained from the simulation and field studies clearly indicate catastrophic influences of volcanic ash deposition and transport on attached benthic algae biomass and on the dislocation of invertebrates and interruption of food-chain relationships. While the short-term impact was moderate to severe on selected populations, all of the principal species tested demonstrated considerable persistence and resilience such that long-term effects of the ash on the in-stream ecosystem are judged to be minimal.",Palouse Basin,,,,Idaho Water and Energy Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198316,iwdl-198316,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-08-28,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,198316.pdf,588

The FAO-modified Blaney-Criddle (FAO-BC) method was selected as the best method for estimating consumptive use on a statewide basis, based on accuracy and responsiveness of the equation and the primary data requirement of air temperature, only. An additional benefit of using the single parameter FAO-BC method is that it can be used as a multiple-parameter method where measured values of wind, humidity and solar radiation are available. A ten percent upward adjustment to FAO-BC estimates per 1000 meters elevation suggested by Pruitt (Dooenbos and Pruitt, 1977) was found to be necessary. Alfalfa/FAO-BC reference ratios developed using Kimberly data were found to be transferable to other Idaho sites. NOAA weather stations throughout Idaho were objectively rated according to the degree of station aridity and environmental effects on air temperatures. Mean monthly temperatures at each NOAA site were adjusted downward according to the station aridity rating and maximum aridity effects reported by Allen (1983) for Idaho.

Research technical completion report,"Busch, John R.",1983-04,,,Irrigation; Irrigation efficiency; Computer models; Computer simulation; Economic analysis,"An irrigation systems analysis procedure has been developed for the purpose of critically evaluation on-farm irrigation system plans and water management practices under New Zealand conditions. The procedure incorporates agronomic information along with irrigation system operating characteristics and costs. Management practices and water supply inputs are also considered. The entire procedure is a computerized model written in Fortran 77. The entire procedure consists of (1) a preliminary analysis, (2) details of system component costs and operations, and (3) a simulation of system operation. In the preliminary analysis, the statistical variation of peak irrigation water requirements is computed. This information is used to estimate system capacity along with irrigated area and/or cropping pattern while considering the level of risk involved. The system component information includes details of crop rotation, plant-soil-water relationships and irrigation priorities. Operating characteristics and costs including two separate loan terms are computed for all irrigation system components. Simulation of system operation determines how an irrigation system functions over a period of time in supplying irrigation water requirements and the costs involved. Results produced by the procedure are designed to show the adequacy of irrigation for each crop in the rotation, irrigation system performance and the causes of any inadequacies in irrigation, and system cost.

Based on historical evidence of landfill operations and on the results of particle size analyses with depth, it is reasonable to divide the soil cover into two layers: (1) an upper surface layer approximately 1-ft. thick consisting of more sand than gravel, and (2) a lower layer at depths greater than 1 ft. consisting of more gravel than sand. The overall thickness of the soil cover was measured with a hand auger at 60 locations across the landfill. A field procedure using cheese-cloth and resin was successfully used to collect large, undisturbed specimens of coarse-grained soils. Water retention tests of the large cores and smaller specimens comprised of the fine fraction (particles smaller than 2.0 mm) provided relationships of capillary pressures vs. water content. Historical meteorological data from a 31-year record was used to estimate the amount of water available for annual infiltration through the soil cover (i.e., recharge). The median value of annual (PPT-ETA) was combined with block-kriged maps of cover thickness, percent-fines in Layer 1, and percent-fines in Layer 2 to generate maps depicting the estimated annual infiltration through the cover (in 50 x 50 ft. cells) for a ""median year. Based on results, regulatory closure f CFA Landfill II will require the design and construction of a soil cap.

Agriculture, hydropower, wildlife, recreation and others are putting forth claims to a scarcest resource. The current mean annual precipitation (MAP) map of Idaho was prepared in 1965. Since then, more data have been collected, particularly in the higher elevation zones where the previous map had to rely on models to provide estimates. The Soil Conservation Service's SNOTEL system provides data for these very important high elevation zones where the majority of Idaho's water originates. Lower elevation data are obtained primarily from the National Weather Service Cooperative network. Monthly data were compiled for the base period of 1961 to 1985. Missing data were estimated by using an average system surrounding stations. All of these data were then plotted using a contouring package. For this report, no manual smoothing was done as the primary objective was to prove out the mapping technique. For the next phase of the project, various interpolation techniques will be used as well as regression models in areas of sparse or uncertain data. The coefficient of variation of the annual precipitation was also plotted. This resulted in a very smooth contour suggesting that lines of equal coeffient of variation could be overlayed upon the MAP , giving users an idea of the variation in precipitation as well as the mean value.

Citizens of the Upper Snake Valley in Idaho became concerned in the early nineteen-twenties that a downstream water right for hydroelectric power generation (a non-consumptive, in-stream use) could stand in the way of future upstream diversionary uses (such as for irrigation and industry. [...] Increasing demands for electricity in [the] water service area, much of which came from pumping for irrigation caused the Idaho Power Company in recent years to seek additional power sources..., and resulted in the Company filing suit against the State to determine the status of water rights... The Idaho Supreme Court held in 1982 that the Company's Swan Falls hydroelectric plant water right was not subordinate to the upstream developments that had occurred over the intervening decades, which resulted in an overappropriation of the Snake River. Legislative attempts to resolve the issue were stalemated. Parties entered into negotiations to attempt a complete settlement of the water rights controversy. The State of Idaho has commissioned this study to provide guidance for its officials in implementing the economic component of the Public Interest Criteria [of the Swan Falls Agreement].

Increases in groundwater pumping rates, primarily for irrigation, have led to changes in surface streamflow, affecting previously allocated surface water rights. However, the magnitude of this effect and its variability over time remain difficult to estimate. The primary objective of this study was to develop a multivariate monthly flow model for Camas Creek, based on stream flows in neighboring basins, and to test whether such a model is sensitive enough to detect, at some statistical level of significance, any streamflow changes that may have resulted from groundwater withdrawals. Monthly streamflow records from Camas Creek and three similar neighboring basins were used to develop a multivariate monthly streamflow model of Camas Creek. Model parameters were based on the recorded statistics for the record period common to groundwater development within the Camas Creek basin. The model was developed and tested for its ability to adequately reproduce the historic pre-irrigation time series for Camas Creek. Then the model was applied to the time period in which significant groundwater withdrawals occurred. A comparison of the modeled streamflow with the actual flows for this period was used to estimate the impacts of groundwater pumping on monthly, seasonal, and annual streamflows. The differences between the two time series were related to the history of groundwater development within the basin. Although the model appeared to simulate the overall historic time series reasonably well, its performance varied by month and season. The application of the model to the time period in which the Camas Creek basin groundwater withdrawals were significant produced a simulated record with lower streamflows than those observed. This may be attributed to the fact that most of the large wells have pumped from deep aquifers, with no connection to the surface stream aquifers.",Boise Basin,Water for Idaho,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198902,iwdl-198902,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-09-11,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,198902.pdf,609

This Act established a committee charged with developing the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Plan. The plan was formulated and passed the State Legislature in 1987. Hazardous waste facility siting criteria, included in the plan, were developed for siting future land disposal hazardous waste management facilities in Idaho. The siting criteria address depth to water, depth to fractured rock, thickness of unconsolidated fine-grained sediments beneath the proposed site, minimum distance to water supply wells, distance to surface water and location outside of a 500-year recurrence interval floodplain. Two standardized methods for comparing and ranking the hydrogeology at a waste management facility were reviewed. The standard methods of DRASTIC and Harry E. LeGrand were analyzed to determine their effectiveness of siting new facilities within Idaho. Hydrogeologic siting criteria from the States of New Jersey, New York, Arizona, and California were evaluated and compared to the Idaho criteria. New Jersey, California, and Idaho addressed the most comprehensive range of hydrogeologic issues; however, Idaho's criteria are the most stringent.

To adequately manage this valuable resource, a good understanding of the precipitation pattern is essential. In particular, a new map of mean annual precipitation is needed. The current map was based primarily on data from low-lying weather stations. Since its completion, new data have shown this map to be inaccurate, especially at high elevations where new data from the SNOTEL network are now available. A new series of mean annual precipitation maps at a scale of 1:250,000 is now being drawn. A computer contouring procedure is used to create the preliminary maps with the final maps being manually drawn. The database used is the National Weather Cooperative Network and the Soil Conservation Service SNOTEL stations. All data records were gathered and standardized to the 1961-1985 base period. Next, multiple regression equations were developed to estimate point precipitation values where no gages exist. Third, point interpolation procedures were investigated as to their appropriateness for use on the data set. Either the normal ratio method or multiple regression was used to derive missing values. Acceptable estimates were made for all missing data. Multiple regression equations for point precipitation data were derived to estimate precipitation in between locations of snow precipitation. The final equations were of the form log(MAP) = f(elevation, location, airmass lifting index). An equation was derived for each of seven regions. Acceptable estimation equations were derived for all but two of these regions. For the automated production of preliminary isohyets, two point interpolation procedures were examined.

Using data from a study done by the U.S. Geological Survey in the 1970's and up-to-date data collected for this study, a three-dimensional numerical computer model of the ground-water-flow system was constructed to provide an understanding of the geohydrology of the study area. The ground-water-flow model incorporates three layers -- an overlying surficial loess layer, a Wanapum Basalt layer, and a Grande Ronde Basalt layer. A ground-water-system recharge rate was estimated using a methodology developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Ground-water discharge was modeled as ground-water pumping, flow to rivers and streams, and flow out of seepage faces, where a layer is incised by a river valley. Three cross-sectional flow models, distributed across the domain of the three-dimensional model along estimated flow lines in the Grande Ronde Basalt, were used to obtain hydraulic coefficient input for the three-dimensional model. The three-dimensional model was calibrated using the time-averaged method for the period 1974-85, and was evaluated by simulating historical pumpage rate changes (1890-1985) and comparing simulated with observed water-level changes. Model results suggest that ground-water levels would stop declining if ground-water pumpage were to stabilize at a constant level. However, ground-water levels will continue to decline in the foreseeable future as long as ground-water pumpage continues to increase. Further study of the recharge, movement, and discharge of ground water in the area is needed to increase the accuracy of any ground-water-flow model to predict the response of the flow system to future pumping stresses.",Palouse Basin,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199004,iwdl-199004,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-09-12,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,199004.pdf,617

Based on historical evidence of landfill operations and on the results of particle size analyses with depth, it is reasonable to divide the soil cover into two layers: (1) an upper surface layer approximately 1-ft. thick consisting of more sand than gravel, and (2) a lower layer at depths greater than 1 ft. consisting of more gravel than sand. The overall thickness of the soil cover was measured with a hand auger at 60 locations across the landfill. A field procedure using cheese-cloth and resin was successfully used to collect large, undisturbed specimens of coarse-grained soils. Water retention tests of the large cores and smaller specimens comprised of the fine fraction (particles smaller than 2.0 mm) provided relationships of capillary pressures vs. water content. Historical meteorological data from a 31-year record was used to estimate the amount of water available for annual infiltration through the soil cover (i.e., recharge). The median value of annual (PPT-ETA) was combined with block-kriged maps of cover thickness, percent-fines in Layer 1, and percent-fines in Layer 2 to generate maps depicting the estimated annual infiltration through the cover (in 50 x 50 ft. cells) for a ""median year. Based on results, regulatory closure f CFA Landfill II will require the design and construction of a soil cap.

A small, but significant portion of the applied pesticide is transported through the soil column more quickly than predicted by currently available models. It has been proposed that increased pesticide mobility occurs as a result of pesticide complexation with a water soluble soil organic fraction, in which the pesticide-organic complex moves faster than the pesticide alone. The present research project is being conducted to (1) develop the methodologies for qualitatively and quantitatively studying pesticide complexation with water soluble soil materials, (2) define the key variables controlling complexation, (3) compare predicted complexation and pesticide mobility alteration with actual results obtained in simulated field situations, and (4) propose a model input variable to produce more accurate estimates of pesticide transport in soil.

Alternative farm practices including riparian vegetation management were evaluated as to their effectiveness in reducing cropland erosion and water pollution. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used for the spatial analysis of the Tom Beall Creek. Water quality analysis for nutrients (nitrogen species and phosphorus) and suspended sediments revealed generally higher concentrations in Tom Beall Creek, a highly developed agricultural watershed, than the West Fork of the Sweetwater Creek, which was minimally used for agricultural purposes. Highest concentrations occurred during spring runoff and were closely correlated with suspended sediment concentrations, especially phosphorus. Riffle habitats in the West Fork Sweetwater Creek were composed primarily of unimpacted cobble-sized particles (12.7 - 20.54 cm) while similar habitats in Tom Beall Creek were heavily silted; the dominant particles usually ranged below 6.35 cm in diameter. The insect community in Tom Beall Creek exhibited signs of eutrophication and heavy sedimentation by having relatively large densities and reduced species richness when compared to the insect community in the West Fork Sweetwater Creek. Midges (Chironomidae) and elmid beetles (Elmidae) were the dominant insects in Tom Beall Creek, while mayflies and stoneflies were abundant and diverse in the West Fork Sweetwater Creek. Using simulation techniques, this study indicated that good riparian management is more efficient in reducing cropland erosion and water pollution than conservation compliance. If the yield penalties with conservation tillage are permanent and the current resource management system is conventional tillage, contour farming and wheat-pea rotation, then conservation compliance and good riparian management would reduce net farm income in the short term. The income reduction, however, would be more evenly spread among farmers with conservation compliance than with good riparian management.

Effects of non-continuous turnout operation on the Aberdeen-Springfield canal system. Research technical completion report,"Hamilton, Brian; Brockway, C.

The fluctuations cause problems in system management and flow variations at other turnouts which require a constant water level to receive a steady flow of water. The canal system was simulated using the hydraulic simulation model CANAL, developed at Utah State University. The objectives were to determine the effects of the non-continuous turnout operation and to evaluate the effects of alterations to the canal system upon fluctuating flow rates and water levels. Simulations evaluated increasing the number and size of spillways, modifications to channel cross sections, modification and addition of check structures, and restricting the timing and number of turnouts with non-continuous flow. Non continuous turnout operation was found to cause little variation in water level in some areas of the canal system, and large variation in others. This fluctuation was largely dependent upon the volume of flow, canal cross section, and the presence (or absence) of spillways. Feasible alterations to the canal system had limited effects upon the fluctuations in flow rate and water levels caused by the non-continuous turnout operation. Limiting the number of turnouts operation non-continuously and the length of time for which the turnouts operated non-continuously was effective in controlling the resulting fluctuations.

Previous researchers have constructed a numerical ground water flow model to simulate future water level trends under various municipal pumping stress conditions. The approximation of a ground water flow system with a numerical model incorporates many simplifications. Accuracy of the model results is dependent on model construction and the validity of the input values that characterize the system. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on model responses to variations in: a) areal recharge to the ground water basin, b) seepage discharge from the face of the Snake River Canyon, and c) constant head versus constant flux boundary conditions. Sensitivity studies demonstrate that simulated water levels in the Grande Ronde Basalt near Pullman and Moscow are relatively insensitive to changes in areal recharge, Snake River Canyon seepage, and model boundary conditions. This is believed to result from model construction and may not be conceptually correct. Modifying the representation of the Grande Ronde Basalt with several model layers and simulating the Snake River Canyon seepage face with drains may enhance the confidence of using this ground water flow model as a management tool.

The lower water table reduces the already deficient river flows, and impacts the senior water rights of many surface water irrigators. Recorded irrigation diversions have decreased in relation to river flow in the last two decades. Diversions are estimated to be depleted by about 30,000 acre-feet per year in dry periods, such as 1987 and 1990. Depletion of diversions is estimated by a linear relationship to river flow, based on data from below normal water years. Extrapolating that relationship to all years, the depletion in a normal water year is estimated to be 13,000 acre-feet. A negative relationship between ground-water pumpage and river flow was extrapolated to estimate pumpage  as 47,000 acre-feet during a normal water year.

In addition it must be easily calibrated, require low operating head, and require little if any periodic current meter measurements to verify the rating curve. The project goal was to evaluate the use of computer calibrated ramped broad crested weirs in establishing a stable stage-discharge relation within the head constraints of most irrigation canals. Structures were built in six canals in southeastern Idaho. Design discharges ranged from 100 to 600 cubic feet per second, while tailwater depths range from 2.75 to 5.45 feet. The required head loss at the design discharges ranged from 0.29 to 0.50 feet. Weirs were calibrated using as-built dimensions in the computer model and the calibration was verified by current metering of the canals every two weeks during the summer of 1986. The current metered flows and weir predicted flows usually differed less than 3 percent. Two of the weirs experienced submergence problems due to construction anomalies rather than weir characteristics. Recalibration using as-built dimensions in the computer model allows construction tolerances to be relaxed. Due to this and the simple geometry, ramped broad crested weirs are less than one fifth the cost of an equivalent Parshall flume.

As both the demand and competition for surface water supplies continue to increase, it is essential that a rational planning basis be established to quantitatively estimate the expected duration and severity of low stream flow periods, especially for extended, multiyear droughts. While hydrologists and engineers involved in the planning of surface water projects have long recognized the need to deal with this hydrologic uncertainty, most of the attempts to date have relied on the use of observed historical critical drought periods. However, since these periods vary from one location to another within the state, their true probabilities of recurrence have not been adequately defined. Moreover, for ungaged streams, or for locations with a limited period of gaged data, the problem of assessing drought probabilities has remained almost totally unresolved.

Michael",1987-10,"Black Lake, North Idaho","47.45, -116.66",Algae(Blue-green); Anoxic conditions; Algal toxins; Livestock; Cattle; Grazing,"Increasing occurrences of blue-green algal blooms in lakes throughout the western United States have been linked to recreational use, sewage inputs, and nonpoint runoff from agricultural and grazing sources. In certain instances these blooms produce toxins that can be lethal to fish, aquatic invertebrates, mammals and humans. Black Lake, in northern Idaho has experienced late summer and fall growths of a toxic alga, Anabaena flos-aquae. Demonstrated fatal toxicity to cattle and small mammals occurred in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1985. The eutrophication and subsequent toxic blooms in Black Lake can be related to its large nonpoint nutrient input from the surrounding watershed. The presence or absence of cattle on adjacent meadows may be a major determining factor in bloom formation. Despite a high proportion of sediments (55 percent) exposed to anaerobic conditions during summer stratification, it appears that internal loading alone does not play a significant role in the triggering of a toxic bloom in Black Lake. Development of A. flos-aquae bloom in Black Lake is dependent on a series of interdependent environmental controls. The most important conditions in Black Lake appear to be high spring nutrient load (compounded by the presence of cattle), high fall water temperature, and stable water column conditions in the fall. The A. flos-aquae strain present in Black Lake formed surface concentrations and produced anatoxin-a, despite comprising only 1 to 2 percent of the total algal biovolume in the water column. Anatoxin-a is produced at times other than when massive surface scums are formed, indicating toxic strains are more widespread in occurrence than previously perceived.",Coeur d'Alene Basin,Water for Idaho,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198708,iwdl-198708,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-09-05,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,198708.pdf,635

A three-dimensional numerical computer model of ground-water flow is constructed to guide this management. Basalt aquifer thicknesses of 0 to 3,500 feet are determined by a magnetotelluric geophysical survey in support of the study. The model incorporates a Grande Ronde Basalt layer, a Wanapum Basalt layer, and an overlying surficial loess layer. A recharge rate of 139 cubic feet per second to the upper layer of the ground-water flow model is calculated using a recharge model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Ground-water discharge is modeled as stream inflow and seepage where a layer is incised by a river. Cross-sectional models distributed across the domain of the three-dimensional model along flow lines provide an efficient means of obtaining hydraulic coefficient input for the three-dimensional model. The three-dimensional model is calibrated using the time-average method and evaluated through a history match procedure. The model incorporates numerous assumptions and simplifications; model predictions therefore are indicative only of general trends for the future.

The study was conducted at the Raft River Experimental Geothermal Power Plant site near Malta, Idaho, and at the Snake River Conservation Research Center with soils and effluent obtained from the geothermal power plant site. The conclusions of the investigation were: (1) Salinity hazard to the shallow aquifer is minimized by high-rate irrigation of previously irrigated lands due to the high amounts of soluble salts found in the native soils. (2) Irrigation disposal of effluent will cause little if any fluoride contamination of the shallow aquifer. (3) The irrigation method best suited for disposal is surface irrigation with borders. The irrigation system will experience problems with cold weather operation. Crop emergence will be hindered by border irrigation. (4) Recommended cropping systems on disposal lands are grain and forage crops, providing the portion harvested did not have contact with the effluent. (5) Two mechanisms in the soil were apparently removing fluoride from the effluent. One mechanism was identified (fluorite precipitation) and one was not. Further study is needed to determine the other mechanism.",Boise Basin,,,,Idaho Water and Energy Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,198403,iwdl-198403,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-08-29,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,198403.pdf,643

Soil moisture contents under reservoir tillage were increased in each study field, and some yield increases were documented also. In no case were yields significantly decreased. The reduction in runoff can be directly translated to a reduction in the energy requirement for irrigation.

Multivariate modeling methods were applied to both historical records to extend their length, based on nearby longer-term records, and the unextended and extended data then used to determine subsequent model parameters. Annual flow models, coupled with condensed parameter disaggregation models, were applied to generate 40,000 year of annual/monthly streamflow records. The statistics and probability distributions of the annual and monthly flows comprising drought sequences are presented, and the theory of runs is used to estimate return periods of historical drought events. It is concluded that the assignment of probabilities to droughts based on historical record length yields inconsistent results when compared to the long-term stochastic process, and that data extension has a significant effect on critical model and run-definition parameters, providing improved estimates of population statistics.

A grain stand reduction problem encountered with the use of basin tillage was overcome with modification to the hanger arrangement on the double disc openers on the drill. After these modifications, basin tilled treatments of spring wheat produced stands and yields not significantly different from conventional tillage. Yield, soil moisture, and runoff data were collected from plots comparing reservoir tillage to basin tillage and conventional tillage in replicated plots for spring wheat, corn, and potatoes. Soil moisture comparisons indicated that more moisture was retained for crop use with the reservoir system as opposed to conventional tillage and basin tillage. Runoff measurements also indicated that no runoff occurred using reservoir tillage, and that from 10 to 60 percent of the water applied left the field with conventional tillage. Yield increases of 9.5 percent with spring wheat, 31 percent with corn, and 22 percent with potatoes were recorded for the plots treated with reservoir tillage versus those with conventional tillage. Microclimate measurements were made of 15, 27, and 40 m downwind of an operating low pressure sprinkler lateral on a number of different days with varying wind conditions.

An intermediate (50 percent) reduction in discharge during the 1980 tests resulted in little change in number or biomass. Most emigration occurred during the first night following the 95 percent flow reduction and was predominantly upstream. Since aquatic insects drifted catastrophically during the 24 hours following flow reduction, habitat changes, rather than food limitation, are indicated as the causative factor. Evaluation of changes in microhabitat utilization by juvenile trout showed that mean fish depth increased slightly with flow but was similar between seasons. [...] Juvenile rainbow-steelhead trout were closely associated with cover during summer and fall with the distance to cover decreasing with decreases in discharge.

The major topics that were addressed are: (1) Development and comparison of simplistic and typical snow covered area maps. (2) Determination of the distribution of slope aspect within and between subbasins. (3) Determination of average snow line elevations. (4) Investigation of the relationship between heat input, snow covered area, and runoff. The development and comparison of the simplistic and typical snow covered area maps revealed that there were differences between the two representations. Since the SSARR model, which is presently used for runoff forecasting by the Corps of Engineers uses the simplistic representation of snow depletion, these differences could lead to some possible problems in the model's snowmelt prediction routines. The slope aspect studies revealed that the distribution of slope aspects within and between subbasins was not equal. Since slope aspect can affect snow melt patterns, this unequal distribution could present problems to the runoff modeling process if these distributions are not accounted for in the model. The average snow line studies revealed that snow lines were not at constant elevations for given snow covered areas as is assumed in the present modeling scheme. Graphs are provided to help determine a realistic snow covered area after estimates of snow line are determined from snow flight data.

Streamwalk II: Learning how to monitor our streams,"Rabe, Fred W.",1992-09,,,Citizen participation; Water quality; Flow characteristics; Substrates; Riparian vegetation; Macroinvertebrates,"This manual grew out of the ""Streamwalk"" program initiated by EPA Region 10 and the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Idaho who offered support and assistance for this project. ""Streamwalk"" was developed as a screening tool to identify potential problem areas and provide a standardized data collection method so regional and trend comparisons can be made. It also encourages citizen commitment to protecting streams and educates people about the relationship between streams and watersheds. ""Streamwalk II"" is an experimental monitoring program dealing with some of the same objectives as ""Streamwalk"" except that it is more rigorous and demanding of the participants. My approach to monitoring is to observe the macroinvertebrate community together with selected physical and chemical conditions in and impacted stream and compare these results with those from a reference or relatively unimpacted site using standard methods that can be repeated over time. The program requires a commitment of from three to seven days in learning about the procedures performed together with going out in the field, collecting data, and late analyzing it. The three modules studied consist of Habitat Assessment, Chemical Analysis, and Biomonitoring. In the biomonitoring program most time is spent on the macroinvertebrate community in the stream and how these organisms provide indices of the relative health of the waterway. A semiquantitative approach in collecting these organisms from a number of habitats is utilized. in learning how to monitor a stream, the participant develops skills in observation, data collection, and analysis and becomes more knowledgeable about ecological principles. Also when citizens monitor a stream, useful data becomes available to the community and may be utilized by agency personnel especially if quality control is built into the program.",IWRRI,Water for Idaho,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199216,iwdl-199216,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-09-19,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,199216.pdf,663

Research technical completion report, 684K823","Izadi, Behzad; King, Bradley; McCann, Ian",1992-05,,,Irrigation; Model testing; Bromides; Soil chemistry,"An experiment was conducted during the summer of 1991 to validate the simple Transfer Function Model (TFM) under variable conditions observed in a 0.9 ha furrow irrigated fallow field. Twenty-one spatially distributed sampling stations were established to monitor movement of bromide (Br). Each station consisted of soil solution samplers at 0.3 m and 0.9 m depth, and a neutron probe access tube to a depth of 2.1 m. A narrow pulse of Br tracer was applied by injection through a sprinkle irrigation system. The tracer was subsequently transported downwards by 3 furrow irrigation events, approximately 3 weeks apart. Soil samples were taken to a depth of 2.4 m prior to each irrigation and at the end of the 63-day study period. The Br concentration data were normalized at each station, and the field-averaged BR profiles were determined for each soil sampling date. Methods based on Darcy velocity and piston flow under-predicted the final Br position. The simple TFM calibration functions were successfully developed based on both soil sample and solution sampler data. The simple TFM calibrated based on soil samples predicted the Br position and general Br profile with reasonable accuracy. The simple TFM predicted a slower movement of the solute front when the calibration function based on 0.3 m solution sampler data was used. The delayed response was attributed to lack of direct contact to soil macropores. Considering the variability and sources of error in a study such as this, use of TFM based on soil sampling is a promising approach for field-scale prediction of solute movement.",,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199213,iwdl-199213,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-09-18,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,199213.pdf,666

The chinook committee of the Idaho Chapter, with the leadership of Dave Cannamela, created this workshop for you. Their objective was to bring new ideas forward and have an opportunity of active discussion... [with the theme] Salmon management in the 21st Century: Recovering stocks in decline. This theme, with minor modifications, might have been the theme of an American Fisheries Society meeting in 1892, 100 years ago. Yet we have a challenge like no other generation facing declining stocks. Over 100 year of professional effort did not prevent the decline of Pacific salmon stocks. [...]I suggest we have three responsibilities as fisheries scientists: (1) to seek biological truth with rigorous review, (2) to be intolerant of partial presentation or misleading presentation of data, (3) communicate clearly the risks society takes when the public chooses to eliminate or compromise biological systems. This workshop offers you two of the tools you need. It offers an opportunity to refine your understanding of several fisheries biology issues, and provides a forum to identify partial or misleading information.

Simulation of the impacts of Shake River Plain aquifer water use on flow in the Snake River,"Johnson, Gary S.; Bishop, Carolyn W.; Hubbell, Joel M.; Lucas, James G.",1993-10,Snake River Basin; Southern Idaho,,Groundwater flow; Groundwater management; Computer models; Simulation; Hydrologic models; Hydrologic systems; Pumping; Conjunctive use,"Ground-water pumping on the eastern Snake River Plain and water use in the tributary valleys will ultimately affect flow in the Snake River. Spring flows to the Snake River have declined during the past two decades. The decline in spring and river discharge may be attributed to water-level declines in the Snake River Plain aquifer resulting from the combined effects of changes in aquifer recharge and increases in ground-water pumping. The effects of increased water use at selected locations in the Snake River Plain were estimated by simulating aquifer water use, spring flows, and river leakage using a ground-water flow model. The model was based on superposition concepts and designed to estimate only the changes in river flow resulting from ground-water use at specific locations in the aquifer. The model was constructed with an initially flat water table with four river reaches interconnected with the aquifer (e.g. fixed head nodes), but with no hydraulic gradient between the river and aquifer. Ground-water pumping was simulated at discrete locations and the response of river recharge and discharge was determined from computer modelling. Changes in flow are graphed in terms of a percentage of the rate of water use. Simulation results demonstrate how the river recharge and discharge in each of the four hydraulically connected reaches varies in response to ground-water use at different locations. Eighteen water use sites were simulated throughout the Snake River Plain. [...] The accuracy of the model predictions are affected by several factors. The degree of interconnection of the Snake River and Snake River Plain aquifer is not known with complete certainty in all areas. Local aquifer systems and additional surface water sources may be hydraulically connected with the Snake River Plain aquifer which are not included in the present simulation. Prediction accuracy is also compromised by errors in estimation of aquifer properties and numerical and discretization errors inherent with numerical simulation. The applied procedure and resulting graphs will further the general understanding of surface water and ground water interaction in the eastern Snake River Plain.

It continued work begun in the late 1980s to assess the vulnerability of ground water of the Snake River Plain aquifer in southern Idaho (Rupert et al. 1991). There were three main tasks in this study. The first task was to apply the rating system developed by Rupert et al. (1991) to other types of aquifers in Idaho. The second task was to perform a verification of the rating system for its validity and reliability. The third task was to map the components of ground water vulnerability at a scale of 1:24,000, modifying the vulnerability assessment method as necessary. An area in western Jerome County was chosen for examination and mapping at that scale. In task one, the Rupert rating system was applied to the Rathdrum Prairie aquifer in northern Idaho, to the Big Wood River-Silver Creek aquifer in south central Idaho, to a portion of the Snake River Plain aquifer near Burley, and to the Jerome County study area. In task two, a statistical analysis was performed on the application of the rating system to each of the aquifers as well.

"High-resolution seismic reflection profiling and modeling of hydrogeologic system, Goddard2 Well, northwest Boise, Idaho.

This study examines the usefulness of high-resolution seismic reflection profiling for identifying sedimentary environments and geologic structures in the western Snake River Plain at depths that have significance for hydrologic behavior at individual wells and for the ground-water flow system in general. In addition, this study applies a discretization scheme in MODFLOW developed to accurately model single-well pumping tests which are common, by design or default, in the lower Boise River valley. A study area was chosen in northwest Boise where only the pumping well (Goddard2 well) responded during an 8-hr. test and the well exhibited negative boundary effects, and where available subsurface data from wells were not sufficient to develop a conceptual model for analysis of the Goddard2 well. [...] Engineering analysis of pumping test data by Mills (1991) identified negative boundary effects and provides a first approximation for hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer pumped by the Goddard2 well. However, a non-leaky aquifer model does not closely match observed behavior. A conceptual model for the pumping test that is consistent with well and seismic data is partially penetrating well in a sand stringer aquifer (in a floodplain environment) receiving leakage from fine-grained surrounding sediments and truncated by a fault (no-flow boundary). This conceptual model was used to simulate the Goddard2 pumping test with a discretization scheme in MODFLOW which accurately reproduces drawdown behavior at a pumping (or injection) well under non-radially symmetric flow scenarios. Results are not unique but provide a framework for evaluating elements that are significant in local and regional ground-water flow, and provide a conceptual model to be tested and iteratively improved with new data and with future aquifer testing opportunities in the area.",Boise Basin,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199501,iwdl-199501,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-09-22,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,199501.pdf,681

An assessment of the ecological impacts of ground water overdraft on wetlands and riparian areas in the United States. Research technical completion report,Grantham,1996-05,,,Ecosystems; Wetlands; Riparian land; Riparian waters; Groundwater management; Surface-groundwater relations; Pumping,"One potential consequence of ground water overdraft which frequently is overlooked in the allocation of ground water resources is the impact of pumping on surface ecosystems which are dependent on ground water. Many researchers have noted the almost anomalous dearth of information on the linkage between hydrogeological factors and ecosystem impacts. As ground water use continues to increase and the health of the remaining wetlands and riparian habitat comes under increasing scrutiny, there is a growing need for an adequate technical understanding of this emerging issue to form the basis of consistent public policy. The purpose of this report is to collect and evaluate information on the location, nature, and extent of ecological effects which have been shown to have occurred in wetlands and riparian areas as a result of ground water pumping. [...] With care to avoid erroneous oversimplification, this information should be used to improve planning and policy regarding ground water use and wetland protection. Permitting processes pursuant to applicable federal, state, and local statutes should include an assessment of the potential for impact from subsurface drainage for projects which may affect wetlands and riparian areas. A major objective should be an approach to water management which there is scientifically valid feedback between the occurrence of ground water overdraft, water stress tolerance limits of affected species, and allowed pumping rates.",IWRRI,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,199603,iwdl-199603,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,2017-09-25,"400 ppi, Fujitsu fi-6770 image scanner, Archival Master file is a TIFF",KIT,199603.pdf,683

Investigation of nitrogen contamination of groundwater from landfill disposal of cull onions. Research technical completion report,"Hutchings, Jonathon J.; Hammel, John; Osiensky, James",1995-10,Southern Idaho,,Waste disposal; Onions; Leachates; Nutrients; Groundwater contamination,"Disposal of cull onions in covered landfills has been a suspected source of nitrate contamination of groundwater in the Treasure Valley region of south-western Idaho and eastern Oregon. A field investigation was undertaken, which characterized leachate generation with regard to nitrogen composition and transport. Two full-scale operational landfills were instrumented prior to onion disposal to: (1) determine the physical controls on leachate generation, (2) investigate nitrate transport using a conservative anionic tracer, and (3) determine the fate of nitrogen.  Water levels were measured in landfills using PVC standpipes, and hydraulic conductivity was measured at the base of the landfills using constant head permeameters. Matric suctions were monitored using thermal dissipation sensors at depths of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 m below the landfills to observe changes in water content and hydraulic gradients. A bromide tracer was used to estimate leachate flux. These measurements, and results of an analysis of unsaturated hydraulic properties of the underlying matrix using the RETC method (van Genuchten et al., 1991) were used to estimate vertical flow velocities in the matrix. Leachate samples were obtained using pressure/vacuum samplers placed at o.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 m. These samples and water samples taken from within the landfills were analyzed for NO3-N, NH4-N and TKN. Results from 40 months of monitoring indicate that anaerobic conditions were established during the first two to three months of landfill operation and that nitrification was inhibited. It is hypothesized that hydraulic and overburden pressures forced decomposing organic material into sediment pores and fractures, forming a low hydraulic conductivity lining. Water derived from precipitation runoff and from decomposing onions was retained in the landfills because of the low conductivity lining. This ""self-lining"" retained water in the landfills and restricted leaching in the underlying profiles to unsaturated flow velocities.

In an effort to gain an understanding of the area geohydrology, the city contracted with the University of Idaho Water Resources Research Institute to develop a numerical ground-water flow model for the aquifer underlying the city of Twin Falls. The steady state ground-water flow model was developed based on recharge and discharge data from the last twenty years. The primary source of recharge to the area is irrigation by the Twin falls Canal Company. Evapotranspiration and unmeasured springs to the Snake River and other surface streams are important sources of discharge from the aquifer. A water budget for the basin was developed using precipitation, surface flow and crop distribution data. Evapotranspiration was calculated using average crop distributions and reference evapotranspiration values. Applied irrigation water was calculated from diversions, measured irrigation returns and land use data. Underflow from tributary basins was estimated or obtained from the literature. The steady state numerical ground-water flow model was calibrated to water level measurements taken from December 1995 to December 1996. The network of 113 wells was measured five times in that thirteen month period. The model parameters which were calibrated were model hydraulic conductivity and spring conductance. Comparison of simulated water levels with measured water levels resulted in a mean absolute error of 17.5 ft. and a root mean square of 24.4 ft., with eighty-one percent of simulated water levels being within 30 feet of measured water levels. As stresses on the aquifer grow, water levels are dropping, causing concern over increased pump lifts and reduced spring flows.

A demonstration field was selected at each of two farms for a pilot ground water project primarily to monitor potential nonpoint source ground water nitrate contamination and to evaluate the effectiveness of two United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommended Best Management Practices (BMPs): (1) a nutrient management BMP through crop rotation and (2) a nutrient management BMP through reduced irrigation water application. An EPA suggested paired watershed approach was used to evaluate independently a different BMP at each demonstration field. For the paired watershed approach, each field was split into a control half and treatment half, and two periods of study were evaluated, a calibration period and a treatment period. The focus of this investigation was to evaluate MBP treatment period effects on ground water nitrated concentrations in shallow, perched aquifers underlying both demonstration fields, that are highly susceptible to agricultural nitrate contamination. A geostatistical approach was developed to evaluate nitrate concentration distributions and BMP effectiveness. A monitoring network of lysimeters, ground water point samplers, and/or shallow wells based, in part, on a geostatistical-oriented design was installed at each demonstration field. Monthly nitrate data collected for these monitoring networks were evaluated using two different types of geostatistical approaches. A sequential Gaussian (SGS) simulation approach was used to evaluate ground water and soil water nitrate concentration distributions at the crop rotation BMP demonstration field (i.e., Forgeon Field). A trend surface analysis (TSA) approach was used to evaluate ground water and soil water nitrate concentration distributions at the irrigation BMP demonstration field (i.e., Moncur Field).

Aquatic habitat indicators and their application to water quality objectives within the Clean Water Act.

The project is limited to freshwater, lotic aquatic habitats in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska with an emphasis on salmonid habitat. Habitat variables were placed into one of the following categories - flow regime, habitat space, channel structure, substrate quality, streambank condition, riparian condition, temperature regime, and habitat access. Candidate habitat variables were evaluated for their relevance to the biotic community, responsiveness to human impacts, applicability to target landscapes, and measurement reliability. The most critical obstacles for use of habitat variables a the regional levels (state specific water quality criteria for Region 10 EPA) are the quantification of biological effect and the unreliability of the measurement system. Inherent variability and unreliable data quality preclude the use of numeric values for habitat variables as compliance indicators in statewide water quality criteria. Rather, habitat variables should be used as diagnostic indicators of beneficial use attainment and pollution control performance, and should be developed and calibrated at local or ecoregional scales as stratified by landscape and stream characteristics. Currently only a few habitat variables meet the evaluation criteria established by the authors for use under CWA authority, specifically large woody debris, pool frequency, and residual pool depth. It is recognized that this limited set of variables will not satisfy the ecological habitat requirements needed to protect cold water biota. Recommendations to increase the applicability of habitat indicators to CWA objectives include an interagency (and international) effort to evaluate landscape classification of aquatic areas, identify and measure reference area condition at ecoregional scales, and develop a systematic approach of habitat indicator quantification. In the interim the authors recommend a re-examination of the narrative water quality standards in EPA Region 10 to provide more specificity in regards to salmonid habitat protection.

The Snake River Plain aquifer, underlying the eastern Snake River Plain, is hosted in layered basalts and interbedded sediments and is an integral part of the basin water resources. In some places, the flow of the Snake River is composed predominantly of aquifer discharge. Aquifer water levels and spring discharges increased through the first half of the century, but have been declining in the past several decades. The long-term changes are in response to changes in recharge and discharge associated with surface and ground-water irrigation. These changes are driving conjunctive management of surface and ground-water resources and the use of a numerical ground water model to understand and help manage the aquifer. The University of Idaho and the Idaho Department of Water Resources developed a two-dimensional finite difference model of the Snake River Plain aquifer in the 1970s. That model has evolved into the model documented in this report. Most recently, the model has been adapted to use the U.S. Geological Survey's MODFLOW code and the domain has been expanded to include the northeastern part of the aquifer system. The model has been calibrated to a one-year period from April 1980 to March 1981. The transient calibration was conducted in two parts. The first part was the original model domain, calibrated by the Idaho Department of Water Resources. The second part, the area near and including the extended domain in the northeast, was calibrated by the University of Idaho. Extending the domain resulted in revisions to the model water budget and created a discrepancy between estimated recharge and discharge components. Further work should be performed to improve the model's reliability.

This report documents another step in the evolution of this model. The most recent changes to the model include the conversion from a specially developed model code to the U.S. Geological Survey's MODFLOW code and an extension of the model domain to include the northeast corner of the Snake River Plain aquifer. Comparison of the simulation results for the April 1980 through march 1981 period verified that the conversion to MODFLOW did not change any significant features of the model and that the previous model generated reproducible results. The equivalent model adapted to the MODFLOW code allows for easier and wider use among scientists and facilitates application of commercial user interfaces and provides greater opportunities for model enhancement. Extension of the model domain to the northeast allows the inclusion of reaches of the Snake River that were previously not simulated. The introduction of 110 new model cells required that a localized calibration be performed that was consistent with the 1997 calibration of the previous model domain. A localized transient calibration was performed to the April 1980 through March 1981 period. The calibrated model replicated river gains and losses in the northeast portion of the model well; however, differences in simulated and measured aquifer heads were relatively large in some areas.

Assessment of needs and approaches for evaluating ground water and surface water interactions for hydrologic units in the Snake River Basin,"Lovell, Mark D.; Johnson, Gary S.",1999-03,Snake River Basin; Southern Idaho,"42.96, -115.13",Aquifers; Computer models; Computer simulation; Well hydrographs,"The Snake River Basin, located in Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah, is experiencing increasing demands on a finite amount of water. The complexity of water allocation is magnified by the size of the basin and the varied types of interests competing for water. Irrigation interests, municipalities, flood control operators, tribal needs, industrial uses, domestic supply, recreation and species habitat requirements are all exerting demands on the water system. To enhance decision making abilities as related to water allocation, the United States Bureau of Reclamation initiated the Snake River Resources Review (SR3). The SR3 project involves all Snake River drainage areas upstream from Brownlee Dam, located on the Idaho Oregon border. In support of the SR3 study, this report addresses the ground-water surface water interactions between the tributary basins and Snake River. The entire study area was subdivided into geographic areas utilizing the hydrologic unit boundaries (HUCs) established by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS). Data were accumulated to identify areas where ground water use may be sufficient to materially impact surface water flow. The data sets include: (1) ground water-rights (location, amount, priority date), (2) water table fluctuations, (3) agricultural land use, and (4) recorded stream flow measurements. Current rules for conjunctive management of the surface water and ground water systems were also reviewed. Aquifers in much of the Snake River basin in Idaho have been modeled by previous efforts. In this study, individual HUCs were compared to one another utilizing the criteria suggested by the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) for prioritizing areas where additional or more detailed ground water modeling should be performed.

The model was applied to estimate the long-term change in ground-water levels and surface water flows from seven different water use scenarios (Spinazola, 1994b). The model helped to resolve the immediate conflicts over water resources in the area, and continues to be the best tool available for assessing impacts of changes in water use. The U.S. Geological Survey provided the Idaho Water Resource Research Institute with data sets and accompanying explanations for the nine different simulations resulting from their investigations. These data sets provide input to the U.S. Geological Survey MODFLOW model (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988), which is probably the most commonly used ground-water flow model in the country. [...] In the present research, the Mud Lake model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey is used to study the effects of additional proposed changes in water use. The results reported in this study are provided as a service to the water users in the Mud Lake area.

A collective perspective involving analysis of amny scenarious will guide water management. These scenarios are being evaluated using the enhanced Snake Plain Aquifer (ESPA) Model. The present version of the Snake Plain aquifer model (version 1.1) was developed with funding provided by the State of Idaho, Idaho Power Company, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The model was designed with the intent of evaluating the effects of land and water use on the exchange of water between the Snake Plain aquifer and the Snake River. The model was developed by the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRI) under the guidance, and with the participation of, the Eastern Snake Hydrologic Modeling Committee (ESHMC). The Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) led the effort and active participants in the Committee included Idaho Power Company, the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, IWRRI and technical experts representing affected users. The ESHMC also provided guidance while conceptually developing this scenario and reviewed this scenario upon completion. Documentation of the model and related activities are available from the IDWR.

Because neither net recharge nor net withdrawals can be directly measured, these are calculated using elements of the surfacewater budget. The calculations involve diversion volumes that are large relative to the overall aquifer water budget (see Design Document DDW-018). For the Model Enhancement Project, water-budget information was spatially organized using a Geographic Information System (GIS) application, and calculations performed in a FORTRAN-language computer application.

The summary is based on the following two reports: (1) ""Hydrogeologic conditions in the Boise Front geothermal aquifer"" (Petrich, 2003). (2) ""Simulation of ground water flow in the Boise Front geothermal aquifer (Zyvoloski et al., 2003). This study arose from a request by the City of Boise to expand current levels of production (with corresponding re-injection) under existing water right permits. This production increase would be used to meet projected demand for geothermal heat in the downtown area. The proposed production increase led to concerns about possible water level and/or temperature changes in the geothermal system by other users. The City of Boise and other major users therefore sought additional hydraulic, thermal, and hydrogeologic information about the geothermal aquifer system, and the development and implementation of a monitoring plan. The purpose of this study was to provide insight and tools for the long-term management of the Boise geothermal aquifer system. Specific objectives included the following: (1) Review and refine the current conceptual understanding of the Boise Front geothermal aquifer system. (2) Consolidate existing hydrogeologic and production data into a single database. (3) Conduct a mass measurement of water levels and/or pressures in selected geothermal wells throughout the system. (4) Construct a numerical model capable of simulating hydraulic heads and water temperatures in the Boise Front area. (5) Calibrate the model on the basis of hydraulic head and temperature observations using methods that quantify calibration confidence.

Final model documentation will include all of the design documents, edited to ensure that the ""as-built"" condition is appropriately represented. This is the final as-built report for determination of land use and land cover. Recharge calculations depend on the type of land use or land cover. Recharge on irrigated lands was calculated according to the net application of irrigation water from surface sources, the mix of crops, the application method, and the adjusted evapotranspiration rate according to the nearest weather station. Design Documents DDW-001, DDW-002, and DDW-005 through DDW-017 discuss various aspects of this calculation. Recharge on non-irrigated lands was calculated according to procedures presented in Design Document DDW-003. Knowledge of land use or cover was required to determine which calculation method to use, and to apply the appropriate parameters in calculating recharge. There are large differences in recharge rate, depending on the land use. Wetlands that are interconnected with the aquifer may result in a recharge of negative two feet per year or more (Goodell 1988), while other non-irrigated lands may have positive recharge of a few tenths of a foot (Garabedian 1992). Irrigated lands may have positive recharge rates of up to several feet. These large differences in recharge rate make it important to correctly identify the land use within the study area.

These minor-area lands were represented as separate polygons to which a fixed net recharge rate was applied. The outcome was a single GIS grid map per stress period, covering the entire plain and representing recharge for non-irrigated land use. In calculating the water budget, the recharge tool (comprised of a GIS component and a Fortran component) considered maps of irrigated lands and applied either the irrigated-lands recharge calculation or the recharge depth from the GIS grid map to appropriate areas of each model cell.

This scenario models one of the proposed managed recharge methods documented in ""Draft Managed Aquifer Recharge Proposal, Thousand Springs Area, Idaho"" (IDWR, 2004). The underlying theory of this scenario is that if, during the period of 1980-2002, we had been able to conduct managed recharge using available water, there would have been an increase in spring discharges to the Snake River. This scenario models this managed recharge and assesses the resultant distribution of gains to the Snake River.

The purpose of flow augmentation has been largely to increase the velocity and/or reduce the temperature of water flowing through mainstem reservoirs in the lower Snake and Columbia Rivers. Although improved adult returns are generally associated with good water years (e.g., high natural flow and spill) during juvenile outmigration, the efficacy of flow augmentation as a substitute for good water years has not been defensibly established. During the period from 1995 through 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Nez Perce Tribe investigated migration characteristics of hatchery-raised, subyearling fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River Basin (Muir et al., 1999). Hatchery raised subyearlings were used as surrogates for wild subyearlings in the survival research. The studies showed that estimated survival from points of release to the tailrace of Lower Granite Dam could be correlated with all three environmental variables examined (flow rate, water temperature, and turbidity). Estimated survival decreased throughout the season, as flow volume and turbidity decreased and water temperature increased (Muir et al., 1999). These correlations have provided the primary basis for the continuation of flow augmentation from reservoirs in the Snake River and Clearwater River Basins (NMFS, 1999). The purpose of this report is to provide a review of the data considered in the Muir et al. (1999) study within the context of determining the efficacy of flow augmentation for enhancing the survival of subyearling fall chinook. In particular, relationships between flow rates, water temperatures, travel times, and estimated survival of hatchery-raised, subyearling fall chinook salmon between points of release and detections at Lower Granite Dam are examined. This report includes analyses of: (1) flow rates and water temperatures at Lower Granite Dam; (2) estimated survival with 5th percentile flow indices; (3) estimated survival and 5th percentile water temperature indices; (4) estimated survival versus release dates; (5) estimated survival versus release groups; and (6) fall chinook travel times and numbers of detections. Finally, these comparisons are used to draw conclusions about flow rates, travel times, subyearling survival, and effectiveness of flow augmentation.",,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200003,iwdl-200003,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200003.pdf,715
Simulation of ground water flow in the Boise Front geothermal aquifer.

The simulations were conducted using the FEHM computer code (Zyvoloski et al., 1997) and the PEST parameter estimation code (Doherty, 2000). The model area included the Harris Ranch, downtown Boise-Table Rock, and Stewart Gulch areas. The geothermal aquifer in this area consists of a complex series of tilted, fractured, faulted, volcanic rocks an interbedded sediments. Recharge was simulated as upward flow in fault areas and lateral flow into the model domain across the northeast boundary. Outflow included lateral flow across the southwest model boundary and discharge wells. The model grid represented a 3-dimensional flow system, with the finest discretization in the downtown Boise-Table Rock area. The model was calibrated to selected 1984 through 1992 water level data, and checked against 1984 through 2002 water level and temperature data. Scenario simulations were run for 30 and 100 years from the present, and consisted of (1) current pumping rates (base case), (2) a 50 percent increase in City of Boise withdrawals (with all increased withdrawals being re-injected). Simulation results suggest that the hydraulic impact of increased pumping/injection, if any, will be minimal. Simulations did not predict appreciable water level declines at the observed wells associated with the increased City of Boise pumping and withdrawals over the base-case simulations. Simulations of increased withdrawals and injection showed minimal impact on inter-annual head fluctuation at the Boise Warm Springs wells. The simulations indicated a possibility of some long-term temperature declines (as much as 3 degrees C, or 6 degrees F, in thirty years). Of the wells included in the model, the only wells showing any thermal changes were the CM#1 and VA Production wells.",Boise Basin,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200306,iwdl-200306,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200306.pdf,716
Influence of canal seepage on aquifer recharge near the New York Canal. Research report IWRRI-2002-09,"Hutchings, Jon; Petrich, Christian R.",2002-12,Snake River Basin; Southern Idaho,"43.56, -116.17",Groundwater; Geology; Hydrogeology; Geohydrologic boundaries; Surface-groundwater relations,"The purpose of this study was to provide constraints on the interaction between surface water and ground water near the New York Canal (NYC). To accomplish this, spatial distributions of key hydrochemical parameters were analyzed with respect to aquifer stratigraphy. Occurrence of tritium (3H) in most of the ground water samples taken from the upper 200 to 300 feet of stratigraphic section near the NYC provides strong evidence of rapid recharge of Snake River Group aquifers. Ground water residence times range from several years in shallow, perched aquifers adjacent to the canal to approximately 100 years in deeper, confined, or semi-confined aquifers. Elevated concentrations of nitrate (NO3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in aquifers underlying irrigated fields west of the canal demonstrate the effect of flood-irrigation on ground water recharge. Ground water in aquifers east of the canal do not underlie irrigated land and do not exhibit elevated concentrations of NO3 and CO2. A ground water divide directly beneath the canal appears to minimize mixing of these waters. Lack of 3H and NO3 and an abrupt decrease in conductivity (Cs) in ground water from wells that penetrate thick, blue clay layers at approximately 2,400 feet below mean sea level suggests that these aquifers do not receive substantial recharge from overlying ground water. Previous analysis of ground water ages suggest that these aquifers contain paleo-water and are part of a much larger, regional ground water system.

Final model documentation will include all of the design documents, edited to ensure that the ""as-built"" condition is appropriately represented. This is the final as-built document describing determination of the source of irrigation water. Recharge from surface-water irrigation is the largest component of aquifer recharge, and a large source of model uncertainty. The second-largest component of aquifer discharge is net withdrawals (calculated as consumptive use, or evapotranspiration) due to ground-water irrigation. The source of water for individual parcels must be identified so that diverted volumes of surface water are applied to the appropriate spatial locations. The source of water also affects the calculation of consumptive use, which depends in part on evapotranspiration (ET) adjustment factors, application method (sprinkler or gravity), and the reduction factor for non-irrigated inclusions within irrigated lands. For an individual parcel, the ET adjustment factor and sprinkler percentage from the local surface-water irrigation entity or the local ground-water irrigation polygon are applied, depending on the water source identified for the parcel. The reduction factor assigned is a weighted average of the sprinkler and gravity reduction factors, depending on the sprinkler percentage assigned to the parcel. Assigning these parameters for calculation purposes requires information on the water source for the individual parcel. An additional need to identify the source of irrigation by parcel is in use of the model, when a hypothetical scenario representing curtailment of irrigation may be tested. Many irrigated lands are either 100 percent surface-water irrigated or 100 percent ground-water irrigated. However, some irrigated lands have mixed ground water and surface water sources. This has typically occurred where surface water sources were inadequate, and supplemental ground water sources have been developed. This paper describes the method used to determine the source of irrigation water, the method used to calculate recharge on mixed-source lands, and the potential effects of errors in determining the mix ratio.",Boise Basin,ESPAM,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,2004010,iwdl-ddw-017_wtr_src_9_04,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,DDW-017_Wtr_Src_9_04.pdf,722

The exchange of water between the Snake River Plain aquifer and the Snake River is a primary target in the calibration of the model. The model will ultimately be used to guide aquifer and river management. The purpose of this document is to describe the gains and losses of the upper reaches of the Snake River within the bounds of the Snake River Plain aquifer.

Precipitation is one component of recharge to the eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. While not the largest component of recharge to the system, it is a significant component that is associated with much uncertainty in the recharge calculation. Precipitation data are used in the ESPAM model in two ways: as the base data for calculating recharge to the aquifer on non-irrigated lands, and as one of several attributes used to calculate recharge to the aquifer on irrigated lands. Precipitation data are needed for the study period years of 1980 to 2002. Three sources of data were considered for use in the model. One source is available for the entire study period, but limited in monitoring stations. Another source is available from 1980 to 1997, but data are not available in a timely manner for the years 1998 to 2002.

Hydrogeologists use the bottom of the aquifer when estimating the volume of water in storage within an aquifer, and when determining the thickness of an aquifer. Often a stratigraphic change defines the bottom of the aquifer. For the Snake Plain Aquifer this might be considered the basalt/rhyolite contact. In other cases the aquifer bottom is defined by gradual changes in material properties. An example of this for the Snake Plain Aquifer might be diagenetic alterations within the basalts gradually reducing permeability as the older and deeper basalts age.

The purpose of this model is to assist in managing the surface water and ground water resources within the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer and the Snake River. Therefore the model boundaries should encompass the boundaries of the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer. Decisions regarding where to place the model boundary must be made where the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer interfaces with tributary aquifers. These decisions should be based on the model purpose and data availability. Extending model boundaries to bedrock outcrops in tributary basins allows incorporation of seasonal and long-term changes into the model simulation rather than estimating them external to the model. Extending the boundaries to Include land with similar irrigation practices is desirable, if the resulting boundary does not cross a hydrologic barrier. However, there is little value in including a tributary aquifer if there are no data available for that aquifer. If aquifer geometry or aquifer head data do not exist, modeled fluxes and responses to stress in the tributary basin will likely be in error.",Boise Basin,ESPAM,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,2004016,iwdl-ddm002_aquiferbound9,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,DDM002_AquiferBound9.pdf,727

MODFLOW has the ability to simulate flux between surface water bodies such as the Snake River and aquifers such as the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. This flux recharges the aquifer when the head in the river exceeds the head in the aquifer or the aquifer discharges into the river when the head in the aquifer exceeds the head in the river. MODFLOW simulates these interactions using a series of mathematical equations. In order for these equations to describe the real world situation, the terms in the equations must be populated with appropriate values. These terms include river stage, river depth, and thickness of the river bottom sediments. This document focuses on estimating these terms for the portion of the Snake River above Milner Dam.

This document discusses whether the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer will be represented as a confined or an unconfined aquifer. The decision to use state-of-the-art parameter estimation techniques makes this decision more difficult. The existing IDWR/UI aquifer model (Cosgrove et al, 1999) uses an unconfined representation for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer and Garabedian (1992) employed an unconfined representation also. Thus, a choice of an unconfined representation for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer would be consistent with tradition. However, a confined aquifer model representation requires fewer computations and behaves more stable numerically than an unconfined aquifer representation. These two factors present significant advantages when using parameter optimization tools that run the model thousands of times to select a parameter suite that minimizes the differences between observations and modeled values.",Boise Basin,ESPAM,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,2004020,iwdl-ddm016_confinedunc,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,DDM016_ConfinedUnc.pdf,731

Final model documentation will include all of the design documents, edited to ensure that the ""as-built"" condition is appropriately represented. Calculation of net recharge from surface-water irrigation and calculation of net discharge from ground-water irrigation require estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ET). The details of the calculations proposed for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer Model Enhancement Project are discussed in Design Document DDW-002. The calculations involve diversion volumes that are large relative to the overall aquifer water budget. The proposed calculations are: (1) Field Delivery = Diversions - Canal Leakage - Return Flows (2) Net Recharge (surface)= (Field Delivery + Precipitation) - (ET x Adjustment Factor) (3) The calculation for net recharge from ground-water irrigation (typically a negative recharge, or net withdrawal) is: Net Recharge (ground) = Precipitation - (ET x Adjustment Factor). These are commonly used and accepted methods (Burt 1999) and are the methods used by the US Geological Survey (Garabedian 1992) and Idaho Department of Water Resources (1997) in former Snake Plain modeling efforts. The ET adjustment factor is an innovation added in this effort to accommodate differences between potential and actual crop conditions. ET adjustment factors are discussed in Design Document DDW-021. Calculation of recharge on irrigated lands will include a consideration of antecedent soil moisture and available irrigation diversions, to allow reduction of ET when water supplies are reduced. This helps avoid under-predicting recharge on surface-water irrigated lands, and avoids over-predicting extraction on ground-water irrigated lands. This paper describes the data sources and methods proposed for determining the basic ET rate for these calculations. Evapotranspiration is controlled by climate as well as crop and soil characteristics. Climate affects the evaporative power of the atmosphere, reflecting the capacity of air to accept evapotranspired water and the energy available to drive evapotranspiration. Soil and plant characteristics control the crop's ability to extract water from the soil, and biological characteristics of the crop that control the transpiration response to evaporative power. Soil texture, surface wetness and condition and shading by crop plants control the soil's evaporation response to evaporative power. Final as-built.

Final model documentation will include all of the design documents, edited to ensure that the ""as-built"" condition is appropriately represented. In the Eastern Snake Plain Model Enhancement Project, the basic equation for calculating net recharge from irrigated agriculture is: (1) Net Recharge = (Field Delivery + Precipitation) – Evapotranspiration (ET) (2) Where Field Delivery = (Surface Water Diversions – Returns – Canal Leakage).  The base ET in equation (1) will be calculated as described in Design Document DDW-010. When the water source is ground water, surface water diversions are zero and the calculated net recharge is negative (net withdrawal). These are commonly used and accepted methods (Burt 1999) and are the methods used by the US Geological Survey (Garabedian 1992) and Idaho Department of Water Resources (1997) in previous Snake Plain modeling efforts. In the recharge tools of the model enhancement project, ET is expressed first as a depth, then multiplied by irrigated area within each model cell to obtain a volume of ET. Various conditions have the potential to alter the actual field ET depth from the wellwatered- disease-free condition represented by typical planning ET calculations and tables. The actual consumptive use depth may also be different than calculated ET if there are consumptive fates for diverted water other than those contemplated by equations (1) and (2). Finally, the actual volume of ET calculated can be affected by bias in the data used for irrigated area within each model cell. If these differences can be identified and quantified, an ET adjustment factor may be applied to correct the calculation of net recharge: (3) Net Recharge = (Field Delivery + Precipitation) – (ET x Adjustment). The recharge tools allow for two ET adjustment factors per ground-water entity or surfacewater polygon, one for sprinkler application and one for gravity application. These potentially could be adjusted by the PEST software during parameter estimation.

For a seven year period (1993-2000), The Nature Conservancy and a coalition of partners guided this study. The primary purpose was to inventory and evaluate the water resource systems connecting the Wood River Valley and Silver Creek. This consortium of organizations -- comprised of municipal and county governments, water and sewer districts, private companies and individuals, and non-profit organizations -- contracted with scientists from the University of Idaho's Idaho Water Resources Research Institute to develop a model of the watershed basin. now the data collection and analysis phases are completed, this Summary Report is designed to facilitate discussion by providing a non-technical overview pulling together previous investigations and distilling key finding into a single, non-technical document. A primary goal of this Report is to synthesize and highlight the methods and findings of two technical reports known collectively as Phases I and II of the Hydrologic Evaluation of the Big Wood River and Silver Creek Watersheds. While the focus of this Summary Report is upon Phases I and II, this Summary also reaches out to incorporate pertinent findings of other investigations as well as provide some original perspectives, organization, and analysis.

The aquifer system lies within the Boise Front Ground Water management Area. Proposed increases in thermal water use have led to concerns about potential long-term impacts to the geothermal aquifer system, and the ability of current aquifer monitoring to detect possible changes. The purpose of this study was to provide insight and tools for the long-term management of the Boise geothermal aquifer system. Specific objectives included (1) conducting a mass measurement (i.e., ""simultaneous"" measurement of numerous wells over a short period of time) of water levels and/or pressures in the geothermal wells, (2) developing a relational database using existing data, (3) reviewing hydrologic conditions in the aquifer, and (4) constructing a numerical model to simulate aquifer productions. The primary areas of interest for this study included the Harris Ranch, downtown Boise-Table Rock, and Stewart Gulch areas. This report provides a summary of hydrogeologic conditions in the geothermal aquifer system. A description of numerical model construction and simulations results are presented in a separate volume (Zyvoloski et al., 2003). [...] The downtown Boise-Table Rock and Stewart Gulch areas have experienced a number of water level decreases and increases since the early 1980s. Despite these observations, it is not possible to conclude that there has not been water level response in the Stewart Gulch area from geothermal withdrawals in the downtown area, or vice versa. Conceptually, faulting along the Boise Front would provide a basis for hydraulic connections between these areas. Although geothermal water in these areas has different chemistry characteristics and residence times (Mariner et al., 1989), the water shares a common source (Idaho Batholith granitics). It is conceivable that stresses from the downtown area could influence water levels in the Stewart Gulch area, or vice versa, depending on the magnitude and duration of the stress.

Evapotranspiration and consumptive irrigation water requirements for Idaho.,"Allen, Richard G.; Robison, Clarence W.",2007-04,,,Irrigation; Water supply; Evapotranspiration; Water management; Economic efficiency; Computer models,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is the primary component of irrigation water requirements for agricultural crops and landscapes. ET is the combined process by which water is converted from liquid or solid forms via evaporation from soil and wet plant surfaces and via evaporation of water from within plant tissue. The latter process is known as transpiration. ET can be expressed as the energy consumed as latent heat energy per unit area or as the equivalent depth of evaporated water. Units for ET are typically mm t-1 where t denotes a time unit (hour, day, month, growing season, or year). Quantification of ET is required to design and size irrigation system components, for operating irrigation and water resources systems, and for conducting water balances. Rates of ET are strongly affected by weather and, during the course of a growing season, by the type of vegetation and availability of water. Evapotranspiration and net irrigation water requirements have been computed for this report on a daily, monthly and annual basis for 123 weather station locations across Idaho for available periods of record. These calculations supersede calculations previously made for Idaho by Allen and Brockway (1983) and use updated methods for calculating both reference evapotranspiration (ETr) and crop coefficients (Kc). The ET estimates represent a wide range of agricultural crops grown in Idaho and ET estimates have been made for a number of native plant systems including wetlands, rangeland, and riparian trees. Estimates have been made for three types of open water surfaces ranging from deep reservoirs to small farm ponds. The ET and net irrigation water requirement calculations are intended for use in design and management of irrigation systems, for water rights management and consumptive water rights transfers and for hydrologic studies. ET calculations have been made for all times during the calendar year including winter to provide design and operation information for managing land application of agriculture, food processing and other waste streams. The weather stations evaluated include 107 National Weather Service (NWS) cooperative stations measuring primarily air temperature and precipitation and 16 AgriMet agricultural weather stations. The AgriMet stations measure a full compliment of weather affecting evapotranspiration and are located primarily in the southern part of the state. Monthly wind summaries from the AgriMet stations and some airport locations in central and northern Idaho were used to parameterize the ETr calculations. Calculations have been made through December 31, 2004 for NWS stations and through December 31, 2005 for AgriMet stations.

Snake River Plain Aquifer model scenario: Hydrologic effects of curtailment of ground-water pumping using Snake River Plain Aquifer Version 1.1: ''Curtailment Scenario''. Technical report 2006-001,"Contor, Bryce A.; Cosgrove, Donna M.; Johnson, Gary S.; Rinehart, Nathan",2006-03,Snake River Plain Aquifer; Southern Idaho,"42.96, -115.13",Aquifers; Computer models; Computer simulation; Water budget,"Hydrologic Effects of Curtailment of Ground-Water Pumping (also known as the Curtailment Scenario), was originally performed using version 1.0 of the Snake River Plain aquifer model [Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRI), 2004]. The Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer Model (ESPAM) has been updated to version 1.1, and the results of re-running the Curtailment Scenario with the updated model are presented here. The Curtailment Scenario is one of many Snake River Plain aquifer model scenarios being developed to assist in resolution of conflicts among water users and guide future water management such as implementation of managed recharge. Water management should be guided by a collective perspective from many of the scenario evaluations rather than a single document. The present version of the ESPAM was developed with funding provided by the State of Idaho, Idaho Power Company, the U.S. Geological Surve y, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The model was designed with the intent of evaluating the effects of land and water use on the exchange of water between the Snake River Plain aquifer and the Snake River. This evaluation is part of the application of the model towards this purpose. This ""Curtailment Scenario"" is intended to answer the question ""If all ground-water rights with priorities after a specified date were to be curtailed, what would the effect be on spring discharge and Snake River gains and losses?"" This set of scenario simulations assesses this question for ground-water rights with priorities junior to the following dates: a) the onset of ground-water irrigation (1870) b) January 1, 1949 c) January 1, 1961 d) January 1, 1973 e) January 1, 1985. The underlying theory of this set of scenario simulations is that if all ground-water rights junior to a certain priority date were to be curtailed, benefits would be accrued to the river gains and spring discharges from the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. These simulations illustrate the model-predicted increases in river gains and spring discharges over time. Benefit to river gains could be in the form of increased aquifer discharge to the river, decreased losses from the river to the aquifer or increased spring discharge from the aquifer. Future reference to increased river reach gains in this report will include all three of these cases.",Boise Basin,ESPAM,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200601,iwdl-200601,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200601.pdf,746
Evaluation of remote sensing of leaf area index for estimating evapotranspiration on irrigated lands.

For example, in the eastern Snake River Plain, estimates of evapotranspiratjon (ET) were used to represent the consumptive portion of ground water irrigation pumping in calibration of an aquifer model, and in applications of that model to determine effects of pumping upon spring discharge (Cosgrove et aI., 2006). ET estimates are often used in water balance analyses to help determine lesser-known components such as aquifer recharge. Remote sensing can be a valuable tool in estimating evapotranspiration on large scales due to the high areal variability of ET and the difficulty of obtaining crop-mix data for large areas. In previous work, algorithms such as METRIC (Allen et aI., in press, a; Allen et aI., in press, b) and SEBAL (Bastiaansen et aI., 1998) have made use of the thermal band data of satellites such as LANDSAT in energy-balance calculations of ET. However, the continued use of these tools is in jeopardy due to the planned discontinuation of distribution of the thermal band of data from LANDSAT (Allen, 2005 a). Additionally, SEBAL and METRIC require significant expertise and processing time, and rely upon operator selection of ""hot"" and ""cold"" pixels. The purpose of this project was to develop and evaluate alternative means of determining the magnitude and areal distribution of irrigated ET, using visible and near-infrared bands fromLANDSAT. The goal of this effort was to identify methods that are: 1. not reliant on thermal-band data, 2. low cost, 3. easily applied and, 4. objective and repeatable.",Boise Basin,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,,iwdl-2007-06,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,iwdl-2007-06.pdf,747

The analysis describes how hydrologic impact (not necessarily injury) varies over time in eleven reaches of the Snake River defined by gaging stations and major spring locations: 1) Ashton to Rexburg, 2) Heise to Shelley, 3) Shelley to Near Blackfoot, 4) Near Blackfoot to Neeley, 5) Neeley to Minidoka, 6) Devil's Washbowl to Buhl, 7) Buhl to Thousand Springs, 8) Thousand Springs, 9) Thousand Springs to Malad, 10) Malad, and 11) Malad to Bancroft. These reaches have been identified as hydraulically connected with the aquifer through previous modeling studies. This tool is based on the enhanced Snake River Plain Aquifer Model. The spreadsheet is intended for comparison of hydrologic impacts from existing uses with those that would result from a ground-water right transfer. A transfer may require that the use under the water right be limited in quantity so that the estimated impacts do not exceed those resulting from continuing the current water use. The spreadsheet allows users to experiment with the rate of use in a proposed transfer in order to achieve the desired balance of impacts between continued pumping at an existing location (or locations) to pumping at a proposed transfer site. What's new in Version 3.1: Version 3.1 of the Water Rights Transfer Tool has been updated to use Version 1.1 of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer Model (ESPAM), the most recent version of the groundwater model on the eastern Snake River Plain. The basic functionality of the Transfer Tool has not been modified. When running the Transfer Tool, the user is no longer warned that old 'well' files exist. The old files are deleted prior to running the tool. Additionally, a definition of which months are included in Spring, Summer and Winter has been added.

The Eastern Snake Plain aquifer consists of a series of basalt flows with interlayered pyroclastic and sedimentary material. It extends across southern Idaho in a swath about 170 mi long and 60 mi wide. The Eastern Snake Plain aquifer encompasses the broad depression extending from King Hill in the southwest to Ashton in the northeast. Its lateral boundaries are formed by contacts with less permeable rocks at the margins of the plain.Numerous investigators have modeled all or parts of the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer. Two models of particular interest include one constructed by The University of Idaho for the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) described in Cosgrove and others (1999) and one by the U.S. Geological Survey (Garabedian, 1992). The Garabedian model was constructed largely as an investigative tool to explore concepts of regional ground water flow and improve scientific understanding of the aquifer. The IDWR model was designed primarily as an aquifer planning and management tool. The modeling effort this document supports, the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer Model Enhancement Project, was undertaken to facilitate conjunctive management of the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer. Thus, the model must necessarily represent both the Snake River and the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer as accurately as possible. The modeling process includes establishing calibration targets, identifying adjustable parameters, and quantifying known model inputs. For this effort, the calibration targets include aquifer water levels and Snake River reach gains and losses. The adjustable parameters include aquifer transmissivity, specific yield, and riverbed and drain conductance.

The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) adopted this rule effective on 3/15/2002. Clearly, the source and distribution of water-born radiation must be well understood in order to effectively implement these new regulations. A number of ground-water quality problems exist within Canyon County, including locally elevated levels of radionuclides, naturally occurring concentrations of arsenic, agriculturally caused nitrate loading, and thermal water. Sampling by IDEQ has revealed strongly elevated levels of radiological constituents in ground water near Caldwell. The geographic extent of this problem is not fully known, and the source of the radionuclides not understood. IDEQ requested that the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRJ) develop the first phase of a multi-year study that will result in an understanding of the geological sources and distribution of radionuclides that affect ground water as well's a hydrogeological characterization of aquifers in the study area.

As part of the data-gathering process for preparation of the plan, the Board and its advisory group have requested an evaluation of the potential to benefit the aquifer by delivering additional surface water to lands that currently have bot a surface-water and a ground-water irrigation right. This practice has been called ""soft conversions."" Soft conversions are attractive on a practical basis because more of theinfrastructure to deliver surface water to the parcels may already be in place. They are attractive administratively because surface-water irrigation rights, often with relatively senior priority dates, are already in place. The legal authorith and ability to deliver water to these lands is more certain than for other uses of water that may benefit the aquifer. When additional surface water is delivered to soft conversions, the benefit is essentially doubled; the first benefit is that ground-water pumping for irrigation is reduced, and the seciond benefit is that incidental recharge from surface-water irrigation is increased. [...] The study addressed four fundamental questions: (1) How many of these mixed-source parcels (parcels with both surface-water and ground-water rights) are actually supplied only from ground water? (2) What is the degree and cost of infrastructure improvement needed to deliver surface water from existing canals to these parcels? (3) Is there capacity in the canal systems to bring additional surface water to the soft conversions? What is the magnitude of benefit that could be realized, if supplies were to be identified and made available?",Boise Basin,,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200802,iwdl-200802,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200802.pdf,758

The ESPAM 1.1 model was calibrated in 6-month stress periods over the 1980-2001 period and model results were matched to both long term and seasonal variations in aquifer head and Snake River gains and losses. All recharge and discharge events and river stage are assumed constant for the length of a stress period, although aquifer heads may be computed at more frequent time steps. In ESPAM 1.1, the stress periods were selected as May through October (higher recharge irrigation season), and November through April (lower recharge non-irrigation season). Recharge and discharge data for each stress period are assembled and processed in the GIS-Fortran based Recharge Program which will work on stress periods of different lengths. In most cases recharge and discharge data and stream stage are available at a higher frequency than semi-annual periods. During model calibration the outputs of aquifer head and river gains and losses are compared to measured or estimated values. Estimates of the aquifer properties of transmissivity (or hydraulic conductivity) and storativity are adjusted to achieve a good fit between simulated and measured values. These property estimates subsequently control model results in simulations performed to guide aquifer management and administration. A more accurate description of recharge and discharge and river stage as model input should result in a better fit to historic measured values and improved calibration of aquifer properties, ultimately generating greater reliability of management and administrative simulation results. Since recharge, discharge, and river stage must be assumed constant during a stress period, it would seem that the shorter the stress period the more accurate the representation of reality. This is true to the extent that a) data are collected at short intervals, and b) there are not unknown or unrepresented elements of storage or lag in the system.",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200807,iwdl-200807,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200807.pdf,762

As discussed in analysis for ESPAM 1.1, Design Document DDW-024 (Erickson, Nelson, and Contor, 2004) some streams in the Snake River Plain that are perched are believed to be hydraulically contributing to the aquifer because of seepage. This design document describes perched river seepage from streams and other water bodies in the Eastern Snake Plain. Some surface water bodies that are represented in ESPAM 1.1 as perched are likely connected to the aquifer, which includes Mud Lake and parts of the Big Lost River and Camas Creek. These were not represented as hydraulically connected because simulating impacts to those water bodies was not part of the purpose of ESPAM 1.1. Because these are tributary to the regional aquifer, this doesn't change the water balance nor does it materially change the propagation of impacts to the Snake River or springs. These water bodies (Mud Lake, parts of the Big Lost River and Camas Creek, part of Twin Falls Canal, and Lake Murtaugh) will be simulated the same as they are in ESPAM 1.1 and will therefore not be discussed in this design document.

Describe banking concepts which provide a market mechanism for trading and/or buying and selling of credits by both private and public entities. 3. Describe banking concepts which support the optimal use of both aquifer storage and surface reservoir storage for irrigators and fisheries in the Snake River basin. Finally, the report discusses the applicability and possible next steps for groundwater banking in the upper Snake River basin, and will discuss extrapolation of findings to other Reclamation regions.

Tributary underflow is the discharge of subsurface water from a tributary basin into an area of interest, such as an aquifer. Tributary underflow to the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer is recognized in 22 surrounding basins. Because tributary underflow is flow beneath the surface, it is difficult to estimate yet it is an important component of recharge in the water budget for the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer Model. The purpose of this design document is to briefly review how the values of tributary underflow were estimated in ESPAM1.1 and to explain how estimates were made for ESPAM2.",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201010,iwdl-201010,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,201010.pdf,773

Reach gains were used to calibrate modeled aquifer recharge and discharge in cells representing five reaches of the Snake River above Minidoka. Reach gains used for calibration of ESPAM2.0 are the best estimate of river gains or losses from or to the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (ESPA), and may differ from reach gains used in other applications (i.e. water allocation) that include surface water contributions to natural flow. Reach gains in three reaches of the Snake River between Kimberly and King Hill were also used to calibrate modeled spring discharge. Groundwater contribution from the south side of the Snake River (outside of the ESPAM model domain) was deducted from the Kimberly to King Hill reach gains. Calculation of reach gains between Kimberly and King Hill is described in detail in Design Document DDW-V2-14 and is not covered in this document. This Design Document describes the irrigation return flow monitoring network, analysis of irrigation return flow data, assignment of return flows to ESPAM2 irrigation entities and Snake River reaches, and calculation of reach gains for five modeled reaches of the Snake River upstream of Minidoka.

As described in ESPAM1.1 Design Document DDW-020 (Contor, 2004), water that seeps from the bed of ditches and canals is direct recharge to the aquifer and is unavailable for delivery to farm fields1 (and therefore unavailable for crop evapotranspiration, return flows to the surface-water source, or in-field incidental recharge). Representation of recharge from canal seepage affects the spatial distribution of modeled recharge, but does not affect the mass balance of recharge or the aquifer water budget. This is because if the water were not applied to canal leakage, it would be applied as incidental recharge in the irrigated-lands calculations. If we adopt an On-Farm water budget methodology, representation of the canal seepage will alter the water budget. This Design Document outlines a proposal for treatment of recharge from canal seepage for ESPAM2. It is based on discussions in ESHMC meetings during the winter of 2007-2008 and e-mail communication from members.

Revision was necessary due to adjustments made to accommodate the On-Farm algorithm of recharge-calculation software MKMOD adopted by IDWR. As described in ESPAM1.1 Design Document DDW-020 (Contor, 2004), water that seeps from the bed of ditches and canals is direct recharge to the aquifer and is unavailable for delivery to farm fields1 (and therefore unavailable for crop evapotranspiration, return flows to the surface-water source, or in-field incidental recharge). In the ESPAM1.1 representation, as well as the previous ESPAM2 representation, recharge from canal seepage affected the spatial distribution of modeled recharge, but did not affect the mass balance of recharge or the aquifer water budget. With the adoption of the On-Farm algorithm, canal seepage is subtracted from gross diversions before the field-headgate delivery volume is calculated. Depending on the calculated adequacy of field-headgate deliveries, the On-Farm algorithm can change the water budget. With this realization, IWRRI proposed and the ESHMC concurred that a second look at canal seepage was necessary. This Design Document reports on the canal-seepage estimates that resulted from this attempt at refinement. Further data and discussion are posted by Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR, 2010a, 2010b).",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,200907,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,200907_rev1,iwdl-200907_rev1,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,200907_rev1.pdf,780

Since June 2009, Water District 01 (WD 01) and the IDWR Eastern office (also referred to as IDWR-Eastern) employees have continued the monitoring effort with some assistance from IWRRI. The Egin Lakes ponds are located near a Bureau of Land Management recreational site at the end of the Recharge Canal in southwestern Fremont County, approximately 11 miles west of the town of St. Anthony (Figure 1). Several designated monitoring wells and one private well were monitored during the recharge experiment. The study area has historically been considered a potential groundwater recharge site. Previous investigations have been conducted to determine the feasibility of recharge and benefit to the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (ESPA). These previous recharge studies along with the Fall 2008 recharge experiment are discussed in detail in the previous Egin report (Contor et al. 2009). The goal of this project was for WD 01 and IDWR employees to continue monitoring the managed recharge effort in the Egin Lakes study area. WD 01 and IDWR employees maintained a majority of the hand water level measurements in the wells measured during the most recent recharge experiment and measured flow in several canals. IWRRI periodically visited wells installed with transducers and downloaded the data. Bryce Contor of IWRRI spent some of his personal time measuring end of canal spill in the Egin area.

This will provide additional documentation of project history and the development of ideas. The ESPAM1.1 recharge tools and algorithms included three mechanisms for representing fluxes between the aquifer that could be represented as singlepoint fluxes into or out of the aquifer. These were the Fixed-point data set, the Scenario-point data set and the Offsite-point data set. The Fixed-point data set (intermediate file extension *.fpt) was designed to represent fluxes that did not enter into any other water-budget calculation. In ESPAM1.1 it was used for various components in the calibration water-budget, as described below. The recharge tools simply added the values to the volume for the appropriate model grid cell and stress period, without performing calculations. Since the MODFLOW code represents all fluxes into or out of the aquifer as if they occurred exactly and only at the center of the model cell, a point data set can reasonably used for any flux that occurs, even if in reality it is spatially distributed. The Scenario-point data set (intermediate file extension *.scn) was also designed to represent fluxes that did not enter into any other water-budget calculations, but was intended specifically for hypothetical fluxes that might be considered in applying the model to scenarios to investigate hydrologic or management questions. Its treatment in the recharge tools and algorithms was identical to the Fixed-point data set, but it was not used in calibration of ESPAM1.1. The Offsite-pumping data set (intermediate file extension *.off) was designed to represent pumping from wells that were distant from the irrigated place of use, where the water was not part of diversion data included in the diversions data sets. The calculation algorithms applied this water as a pumping withdrawal and also included it in canal-seepage and irrigated-lands calculations. The Fixed-point and Offsite-point data sets are retained in ESPAM2 waterbudget calculations, with essentially the same roles and definitions. This design document describes the particular water-budget components represented using these data sets and the details of the calculations.",Boise Basin,ESPAM2,,,Idaho Water Resources Research Institute; University of Idaho,University of Idaho,eng,201005,iwdl-201005,Rights to the digital resource are held by the University of Idaho. http://www.uidaho.edu/,,application/pdf,Text,,born digital,KIT,201005.pdf,783
