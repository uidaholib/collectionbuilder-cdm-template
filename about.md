## About the Collection

A variety of photographs from several photographic collections held by Special Collections & Archives that depict scenes from the University of Idaho's past. Includes portraits of past professors and alumni, as well as photos of buildings and events. Images also show prominent homes, scenes, and historical events in Moscow, ID. As one of our earliest digital collections, images were chosen by Special Collections staff to facilitate often-requested themes and locations, and to give a broad overview of our great history. Images come from ten different photograph collections and one manuscript collection, many of which have since been digitized in their entirety or as part of other digital collections. The list of source collections and links if available are below:
