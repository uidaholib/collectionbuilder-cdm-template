I"<h3>About the </h3>
<p>The 160 lantern slides (3 duplicates) register images of an international trip by Dean of the College of Agriculture E.J. Iddings and his wife Maude Rowell in 1927. Iddings took a sabbatical leave from June to December to study agricultural practices abroad. He visited Great Britain and overseas dominions of the British Empire, including New Zealand, Australia, India, Ceylon, and Egypt. Other European countries in the tour included Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and Italy. The images depict agricultural practices in the countries they visited, along with scenes of the cities, buildings, transportation, and people. In that occasion he participated as a delegate to the International Rotarians Convention in Ostend, Belgium. It may be that a few slides are not from this trip, but they are related to agriculture. </p>
