# Notes

## Metadata

- Subjects need to be improved. They are all just "Forestry", while every image could benefit from some subject classification.  Species names, common names, people, places, concepts, lots of stuff.
- Changed location to subject, since it is the LCSH headings and the only thing unique that resembles a subject.
- Changed subject to subject (useless)

## Other thoughts

- Going to need to be responsively designed.  The about page uses a simple floating mechanism to make the three columns work, but I don't know that that is appropriate in the grid system.

This highly customized version of [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm) is used by the University of Idaho Library to create skins for the digital library collections maintained in a hosted CONTENTdm instance. 
Active development takes place in the [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm repository](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm).

Librarians and staff work with a clean version of a single collection's metadata, as stored in a .csv file.
Collection settings are customized using the [`_data/theme.yml`](https://github.com/uidaholib/collectionbuilder-cdm-template/blob/master/_data/theme.yml).
Each digital collection is a branch in this repository.

While this version was built specifically for use at the University of Idaho Library, any other institution currently using CONTENTdm can also adopt it, starting from the generic base [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm) template.
