# Collection-specific notes:

- The record below was removed from the metadata. It is supposed to represent the Kooskia scrapbook in its entirety, but really it's a compound objects in cdm instead of a pdf, so the download link doesn't work.

# CollectionBuilder CONTENTdm

https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/

This highly customized version of [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm) is used by the University of Idaho Library to create skins for the digital library collections maintained in a hosted CONTENTdm instance. 
Active development takes place in the [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm repository](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm).

Librarians and staff work with a clean version of a single collection's metadata, as stored in a .csv file.
Collection settings are customized using the [`_data/theme.yml`](https://github.com/uidaholib/collectionbuilder-cdm-template/blob/master/_data/theme.yml).
Each digital collection is a branch in this repository.

While this version was built specifically for use at the University of Idaho Library, any other institution currently using CONTENTdm can also adopt it, starting from the generic base [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm) template.
