### Idaho history

Idaho's landscape has been occupied by Indigenous people for thousands of years. Much archaeological evidence shows that Indigenous people have been living in Idaho for at least 8,000 years, while one study show "there is evidence that intelligent, highly skilled people have lived in Idaho for at least the past twelve to fifteen thousand years."[^1]

In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled through Idaho. When they traveled through the area that became the town of [Gibbonsville](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/cities/browse.html#gibbonsville), they described it as "filled with rocky hills and dense vegetation," which accurately describes much of Idaho's vast wilderness.[^2]

In 1860, gold was discovered near Pierce, Idaho, igniting a fierce gold rush in the state. This gold rush led to the development of a strong [mining industry](http://127.0.0.1:4000/digital/cities/browse.html#mines) and the establishment of many mining cities and towns throughout the state, including:[^3]

In 1863, Congress established Idaho Territory. Idaho Territory spanned a surface that was 25% larger than the modern state of Texas.[^5] According to legend, the name "Idaho" was "derived from a Shoshone phrase meaning 'gem of the mountains.'"[^6]
