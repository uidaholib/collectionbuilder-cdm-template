## About the Collection

The Argonaut Photograph Collection features over 700 photos taken by The Argonaut staff members between the years 1980 and 1988. The images depict sporting events, academic groups, and other aspects of student life. 

The photos in this collection were donated to the U of I Library Special Collections in 1988 by Leo Ames. Ames was a longtime presence at the University of Idaho, beginning as a student in the 1950s and retiring from his position as creative director and head of publications at the UI Publications and News Bureau in 1995.
