## About the Collection

This collection contains historic mining films from Idaho's Silver Valley Mining District and elsewhere, originally filmed by Harry Webb Marsh. These films were preserved thanks to a 2007 Partnership Grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation (NFPF) awarded to the University of Idaho Library's Special Collections & Archives. 

The original moving pictures were filmed in 1926 and 1930 by Harry Webb Marsh, a mining engineer employed by the Tamarack and Custer Mining Company of Coeur d'Alene. Shot with one of the first private motion picture film cameras in Idaho, the films appear to be the earliest known footage of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Smelter (1926), the Hercules and Hecla operations at Burke and Murray (1926), and the Coeur d'Alene Mines and the Little Sunshine Mine (1930). These films are held as part of the Harry Webb Marsh Collection (MG 23).[^1]

## About Harry Webb Marsh

Harry Webb Marsh was born in Moscow, Idaho on March 3, 1886. He was the first of three sons born to William and Mattie Marsh whose home was on the corner of First and B streets. He was educated in the Moscow City schools and the University of Idaho Preparatory School. After working for several years he returned to the University of Idaho to study mining engineering. 

In 1903 he made his first trip to the Coeur d'Alene mining area where he worked for a time at the Tiger Poorman Mine before returning to Moscow. His first job upon leaving, the university came in 1910 when he began working in the assay office of the Hercules Mining Company. He also helped on the design and construction of that company's new concentrating plant. In 1912 he went to White Horse, Yukon Territory to manage the Atlas Mining Company, but due to low copper prices the mine shut down in 1913. He then went to Dawson, Yukon Territory, as an engineer with the Canadian Klondike Dredging Company, but at the beginning of World War I all the men in the area enlisted in the Canadian Army. He then went to Alaska where he was employed by the Alaska Treadwell Gold Mining Company on Douglas Island, and later by the Alaska Gastineau Gold Mining Company in Juneau.

He returned to the Coeur d'Alenes in the fall of 1915 and joined the engineering staff of the Federal Mining and Smelting Company. In 1917 he began work for the Tamarack and Custer Mining Company where he remained until 1933. He continued to work for the Day family mining interests until 1941 when he was asked to go to Boise to assume the office of secretary-treasurer of the Idaho Mining Association, a position he held until his retirement in 1959. In 1949 President Harry S. Truman appointed him to the National Technical Task Committee on Industrial Wastes where he represented the entire non-ferrous metal mining industry.

From 1935 to 1941 he was in charged of the Shoshone County flood relief program. Working with the Army Corps of Engineers he supervised the construction of 28 Civilian Conservation Corps Camps to assist with this work. One of these camps, Camp F-30 in Pritchard, was renamed Camp Harry Marsh on July 16, 1933.

His other activities included serving as Shoshone County vice president of the North Idaho Chamber of Commerce for many years and as president of that organization in 1942. He also served as treasurer of the State Chamber of Commerce. He was a member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers and Petroleum Geologists, voted an Honorary Life Member of the Northwest Mining Association in 1953, and was a member of the Elks and many other clubs and organizations.

While working in Alaska in 1913 he met Lovina Willson whom he married in Seattle June 8, 1916. They had two children.[^2]

## About Mining Companies

#### Bunker Hill

In 1885, a prospector’s errant burro wandered off only to discover an outcropping of galena, a lead- and silver-rich ore. Within days, the Bunker Hill claim was established. It grew from a strictly mining enterprise to a large industrial complex capable of carrying out every step in the production process from removing ore from the ground to fabricating finished metal products. The company became an important supplier of the nation’s requirements for lead, zinc, silver, and cadmium.

Starting with the original Bunker Hill and Sullivan claims, the Bunker Hill Mine later encompassed 620 claims totaling 6,2000 acres. From the discovery cuts some 3600 feet above sea level, over 20 major ore zones were mined to nearly 1600 feet below sea level, a vertical distance of about one mile.

At its peak the company produced corroding lead, antimonial lead, silver, special high grade zinc, zinc diecasting alloys, cadmium, specification lead alloys, leaded zinc oxides, dore metal, super purity antimony, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid at its Kellogg, Idaho, operations, and manufactured lead products such as sheet, pipe, sleeving, casting, solders, shot, lead oxides and battery oxide, red lead, antimonial lead, and soft and calking lead, at its Seattle, Washington, operations.[^3]

#### Coeur d'Alene Mining District

The Coeur d'Alene Mining & Smelting Company was incorporated in the State of Idaho on July 18, 1904, with a capitalization of 1,000,000 shares at a par value of $1.00 a share. Stanley Fairweather was the president of the company until 1915 when he was succeeded by Dennis Goggin. In 1917 Alex D. Wallace became president and remained in that office until 1937.

The property of the company originally consisted of seven unpatented claims, about 140 acres, in the Placer Center District, 3.5 miles north of Wallace; three unpatented claims were acquired later. Development, financed by stock assessments, consisted of two tunnels, the upper one of 900 feet, and a lower one of 1400 feet, and a 100 foot shaft. The property became idle in 1935, and was absorbed by Dayrock Mining Company in 1937.[^4]
