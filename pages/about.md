### Idaho history

In 1863, the U.S. Congress created Idaho Territory which "sprawled across an area one-quarter larger than Texas."[^1] Idaho was admitted to the union as the 43rd state in 1890.[^2] The name "Idaho" is believed to have been "derived from a Shoshone phrase meaning 'gem of the mountains.'"[^2]

### Albion

- The first non-indigenous settlers arrived to Albion in 1875 and by 1887, a Mormon ward was established.[^3]
- It is believed that the town was named after the island Albion of Great Britain.[^3]
- Albion was home of Albion State Normal School which was established in 1893 “as a result of petitions from the people of the town…Land was donated to the state and volunteer labor from the town was used in constructing the first building.”[^4] The school’s name was changed in 1947 to Southern Idaho College of Education “when it was granted accreditation as a four-year institution.”[^4]  Before it closed in 1951, the school produced over 6400 teachers.[^4]

### Bovill

- According to the Moscow-Pullman Daily News in 2018, Bovill is “a town whose history exemplifies many of the elements that today we associate with the Wild West.”[^5]
- The town’s story begins with Francis Warren who had a personal settlement on the site. An Englishman, Hugh Bovill, came in 1899 to buy Warren’s site “and build a hotel that could accommodate fellow hunters and anglers with an appetite for adventure” because he had been “drawn to the American frontier by tales of ample big game."[^5]
- The town initially grew because the timber industry was growing and drawing “homesteaders to northeast Latah County, so Bovill opened a store to supply their needs.”[^5]
- To learn more about Bovill's early days, Latah County Historical Society recorded oral histories in the 1970s that "reveal the hardships that folks endured, the kindness of strangers and the fire that destroyed much of the town."[^5]

### Boise

- The Boise Basin area saw its first non-indigenous settlers around the 1860s as people rushed to the area during the 1862 gold rush and established Fort Basie in 1863 (“the rise of mining interests and the resulting population surge prompted the U.S. military to establish Fort Basie”).  With an advantageous location “at the crossroads of the Oregon Trail and the routes fo the Boise Basin and Owyhee mines,” Boise’s population grew early and it eventually became the state capital in 1864.[^6]

### Burke

- Burke was settled by non-indigenous settlers in 1884 after mining for lead and silver brought a railroad in 1887.[^7] Burke is well-known as an extremely narrow valley, only 300 feet wide, uncommon for a town.[^7] A second railroad was built in 1890 and “its tracks had to be laid in Burke’s only street.”[^7] “It is said that many of the businesses had to roll in their awnings before the train passed.”[^7]
- As a mining site, it became part of the Coeur d’Alene [mining] District.[^7] Burke has an interesting history of mining labor strikes and unrest.[^7]
- The town saw many natural disasters – avalanches, floods – but the most notable is the large fire of 1923 that destroyed much of the town.[^7]
- In 1991, the last remaining mine closed down.[^7]
- As of 2020, Burke is an abandoned ghost town.[^7]

### Coeur d'Alene

- Coeur d'Alene's earliest settlement days by non-indigenous people date back to the early 1800s when "the Northwest Fur Trading Company...began to establish fur trading posts in the Inland Northwest."[^CDA1] One of the trading posts was located on Lake Pend O'Reille. French fur traders in this area "began to use the French words 'Coeur d'Alene' as a nick name for the Schitsu’umsh people" who traded at the Lake Pend O'Reille post.[^CDA1] "In French 'Coeur' means heart and 'Alene" means awl, a sharp pointed tool used to pierce leather. In other words, they were known as sharp traders with hearts like the point of an awl. Within a few years the Schetsu’umsh people became known as the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and the large lake which was the center of their homeland became Lake Coeur d'Alene."[^CDA1]
- By 1878, a military fort was built on the lake and the population grew around it. Today, North Idaho College is on the location of that military fort, although "three of the original fort buildings are still in use: the chapel, powder magazine and one of the officer's quarters."[^CDA1]
- The city incorp[orated in 1887 and continued to grow in population as "railroads and steamboats provided transportation points between the Coeur d'Alene Lake, the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene Rivers," meaning the lake "soon became a destination for thousands of tourists."[^CDA1]

### Elk River

- Elk River saw its first homesteader, William Trumbull, in 1897.[^ElkRiver1] The town was first named "Trumbull" after him.[^ElkRiver1]
- By 1910, the Potlatch Lumber Company built the nation's first electric saw mill after buying Trumbull's homestead.[^ElkRiver1] The town saw fast growth and changed its name from "Trumbull" to "Elk River."[^ElkRiver1] 
- The saw mill and planner mill closed in 1932-1933 after "a newer bigger sawmill was built in Lewiston...and the town started to suffer" in 1927.[^ElkRiver1]

### Emmett

- Emmett is the county seat and only city in Gem County. 

### Ferrell

- Ferrell is named after one of the first non-indigenous settlers, William Ferrell, who moved to the area around St. Joe River from Coeur d'Alene in 1883.[^Ferrell1] Ferrell staked his claim as other homesteaders moved to the area, building a hotel, a general store, platting a community, and selling lots of land for businesses and residences, all in his own name.[^Ferrell1]
- According to one source, by 1907, "the town boomed so quickly that railroad surveyors were interested in developing a possible route through Ferrell. William Ferrell, however, decided to play hardball with the surveyors, hoping to receive $100,000 for a right-of-way through his community. Balking at his request, the Milwaukee and Puget Sound Railroad simply bypassed Ferrell, created a bridge to the river's south side, and began selling acreage for the new town-site, St. Joe City. Ferrell could not compete with the trade and economic center established at nearby St. Joe City, and in just four years, most of Ferrell's residents had left. William Ferrell eventually moved to St. Joe City...A schoolhouse operated in Ferrell until 1925, but today, only a quiet prairie remains at the old town-site."[^Ferrell1]
- In 1995, the Spokesman-Review described Ferrell as a city "of which there is barely a trace today."[^Ferrell2]

### Gibbonsville

- Lewis and Clark had traveled through this area in September 1805. They described it as "filled with rocky hills and dense vegetation. During their journey, they were required to cut a road just northwest of the present-day townsite through a very steep area. Along the way, several of their horses fell or slipped down the hillsides, during which one was permanently crippled and two gave out."[^Gibbonsville1]
- The first non-indigenous settlers arrived around 1872 but, after 1877 when gold was discovered nearby, "the small settlement officially became a town and was named Gibbonsville in honor of Colonel John Gibbon, who pursued the Nez Perce Indians and fought in the Battle of the Big Hole."[^Gibbonsville1]

### Moscow

- The first non-indigenous settlers came to Moscow, Idaho in 1871 and was officially given the name “Moscow” in 1877 when a man, Samuel Neff, “filed for a postal permit under the name of Moscow because the area reminded him of his hometown of Moscow, Pennsylvania.”[^Moscow]
- Some sources suggest that the site was initially called “Hog Heaven” but later changed to “Palouse Valley” before becoming “Moscow.”[^Moscow]
- Moscow was “incorporated in 1887 and was chosen as the site for a land-grant institution, the University of Idaho, in 1889.”[^Moscow]

### Lewiston

- Lewiston was “established as a gold-mining town on a site where the explorers Meriwether Lewis (for whom it was named) and William Clark camped (1805, 1806)” and it stands as “Idaho’s oldest incorporated community and was the first territorial capital” from 1863-1864 before the capital was moved to Boise, Idaho in 1865.[^Lewiston1]
- Lewiston, Idaho has been closely tied to Clarkston, Washington because “the only thing separating [the two] is a river with a state line running through it.”[^Lewiston2] Clarkston was also named after William Clark.[^Lewiston2]Together, they compose the “gateway to Hell’s Canyon National Recreation Area, home of North America’s deepest gorge.”[^Lewiston2]
