## About the Collection

<h3>About the Latah County Community Heritage Collection{{site.data.theme.title}}</h3>
<p>The Latah County Common Heritage Collection was driven by funding from a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) <a href="https://www.neh.gov/grants/preservation/common-heritage"> Common Heritage Grant</a> awarded to the University of Idaho Library in 2016. The materials in this collection were collected via community digitization days held in Moscow and Potlatch in 2016 and 2017. </p>
<p>The project was a collaboration between the University of Idaho Library and the <a href="https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/">Latah County Historical Society</a>; it was directed by Devin Becker, Dulce Kersting, and Erin Stoddart.  If you have any questions about the collection or are interested in donating materials, please email us at <a href="mailto:libspec@uidaho.edu">libspec@uidaho.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The collection would not be possible without generous donations of time and materials from a variety of individual donors and staff. The directors would like to thank our donors: <p style="width:50%;font-size:larger;text-align:center;float:left;">Wilma Daniels<br /> The City of Moscow<br /> Ariana Burns<br /> LeNelle McInturff<br /> Elizabeth Stevens<br /> Nels Reese<br />  Gary Strong<br /> M Spakoski</p><p style="width:50%;font-size:larger;text-align:center;float:left;"> Janice Palmer<br /> Ann Davis<br /> John Wolheter<br /> Virginia Soncarty<br /> Joe Rohn<br /> Verna Comstock <br/> Dusty Fleener<br/> <br/> </p>
