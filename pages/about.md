## The Festival's Beginnings

The University of Idaho held it's first jazz festival in 1967. 

1982, Ella Fitzgerald performs at the festival.

## The Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival

Lionel Hampton first performed at the University of Idaho Jazz Festival in 1984. After seeing the festivalâ€™s dedication to educating students, Hampton and the University began an 18 year relationship. In the years following Hampton's first visit, this relationship saw the jazz festival and School of Music named after him. Hampton would also go on to receive an honorary degree from the university in 1988. Due to the relationship developed between Hampton and the university the festival grew from a one day festival to a four day festival at it's peak, featuring world class jazz musicians and clinics not only in jazz music, but dance and history. 



Starting in 1995, Hampton and the University of Idaho began the Jazz in the Schools program. This program brought the world class jazz musicians coming to the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival into the K-12 class room. The musicians would come and visit schools in the area to talk about music and jazz. Every year during the festival, Hampton would travel to Lapwai, Idaho for the Jazz in Schools program.
