## About Bovill, Idaho

Bovill has been described as "a town whose history exemplifies many of the elements that today we associate with the Wild West."[^1] The story of Bovill begins with Francis Warren who had a personal settlement on the site. An Englishman, Hugh Bovill, came in 1899 to buy Warren's site "and build a hotel that could accommodate fellow hunters and anglers with an appetite for adventure" because he had been "drawn to the American frontier by tales of ample big game."[^1] The town initially grew because the timber industry was growing and drawing "homesteaders to northeast Latah County, so Bovill opened a story to supply their needs."[^1]

To learn more about Bovill's early days, [Latah County Historical Society](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/) recorded oral histories in the 1970s that "reveal the hardships that folks endured, the kindness of strangers and the fire that destroyed much of the town."[^1]
