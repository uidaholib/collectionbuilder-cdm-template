The photos in this collection were donated to the U of I Library Special Collections in 1988 by Leo Ames. Ames was a longtime presence at the University of Idaho, beginning as a student in the 1950s and retiring from his position as creative director and head of publications at the UI Publications and News Bureau in 1995.
