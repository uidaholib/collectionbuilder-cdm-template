## About the Fires

The spring of 1910 was ominously dry throughout Idaho, Washington, and Montana. In the Coeur dâ€™Alene National Forest alone, U.S. Forest Service officials had been battling fires since early April. In July, a rainless electrical storm ignited even more blazes across the Northern Rockies. Bad as it was, conditions got worse.

On August 20, a "Palouser" wind whipped through the forests, creating an inferno now known as the Big Burn. The fires took the lives of nearly 90 people, leveled entire communities, burned almost 3 million acres of timber, and set US Forest Service fire policy for the next 6 decades.

Also included are a [first-person history of the 1910 fires](/digital/bigburn/items/bigburn00.html), written by Elers Koch, and a two-part (Part 1: [Transcript](/digital/bigburn/items/bigburn65.html), [Recording](/digital/bigburn/items/bigburn46.html); Part 2: [Transcript](/digital/bigburn/items/bigburn66.html), [Recording](/digital/bigburn/items/bigburn47.html)) interview with Ione "Pinkie" Adair, who witnessed the fire first hand. Timothy Egan used these histories, photographs, and other materials from the Library's Special Collections & Archives department during the composition of *The Big Burn*, as he notes in the acknowledgements section towards the end of his book.
