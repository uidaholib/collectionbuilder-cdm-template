# The Argonaut

The University of Idaho student run newspaper, the [Argonaut](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/argonaut/), has been in print since 1898. G. W. Wolfe was the first Editor-in-Chief, and those who worked in the editorial staff included Ava Sweet (Senior Editor), Susie Maxwell (Junior Editor), G. Mix (Sophomore Editor), and H. Lancaster (Freshman Editor). It was originally set to be published twice a week during an academic year. It's popularity grew, and soon it became a resources that students, staff, faculty, and the local community counted on. Today most issues are available completely [online](https://www.uiargonaut.com/), with some still printed as special publications.

The photos in this collection were donated to the U of I Library Special Collections and Archives in 1988 by Leo Ames. Ames was a longtime presence at the University of Idaho, beginning as a student in the 1950s and retiring from his position as creative director and head of publications at the U of I Publications and News Bureau in 1995. The donation was fully processed in 2018 with a complete [finding aid](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv681386) prepared for patrons to view.
