## About the Collection

The Hal Riegger Papers Collection is made up of maps, correspondence, oral history tapes and transcripts, and a large number of photographs dealing with the Camas Prairie Railroad, all collected by Hal Riegger from 1981-1986 and used in the writing of his book, *The Camas Prairie: Idaho’s Railroad on Stilts*. The Camas Prairie Railroad is one of the United States’ most scenic and fascinating railroads. Jointly owned by Northern Pacific Railway and Union Pacific Railroad, it was headquartered in Lewiston, Idaho, with lines running northwest to Ayer, Washington; Grangeville, Idaho; Stites, Idaho; and to Headquarters, Idaho.

## About Hal Riegger

Hal Riegger was born in 1913 in Ithaca, New York. He received his B.A. and M.A. degrees at the New York State College of Ceramics and The Ohio State University, respectively. Riegger taught ceramics for most of his life, had his work exhibited in museums across the country, and published three books on the subject of ceramic pottery. 

In addition to his professional work in the art world, Riegger was very active in the field of rail history and model railroading—his interest in trains dates back to childhood and a set of Lionel O gauge train models owned by his aunt. He was a member of the National Model Railroad Association and served on its standards committee.
