### Idaho history

In 1863, the U.S. Congress created Idaho Territory which "sprawled across an area one-quarter larger than Texas."[^1] Idaho was admitted to the union as the 43rd state in 1890.[^2] The name "Idaho" is believed to have been "derived from a Shoshone phrase meaning 'gem of the mountains.'"[^2]

### Brief history of Bovill, Idaho

- According to the Moscow-Pullman Daily News in 2018, Bovill is “a town whose history exemplifies many of the elements that today we associate with the Wild West.”[^5]
- The town’s story begins with Francis Warren who had a personal settlement on the site. An Englishman, Hugh Bovill, came in 1899 to buy Warren’s site “and build a hotel that could accommodate fellow hunters and anglers with an appetite for adventure” because he had been “drawn to the American frontier by tales of ample big game."[^5]
- The town initially grew because the timber industry was growing and drawing “homesteaders to northeast Latah County, so Bovill opened a store to supply their needs.”[^5]
- To learn more about Bovill's early days, Latah County Historical Society recorded oral histories in the 1970s that "reveal the hardships that folks endured, the kindness of strangers and the fire that destroyed much of the town."[^5]

### Brief history of Boise, Idaho

- The Boise Basin area saw its first non-indigenous settlers around the 1860s as people rushed to the area during the 1862 gold rush and established Fort Basie in 1863 (“the rise of mining interests and the resulting population surge prompted the U.S. military to establish Fort Basie”).  With an advantageous location “at the crossroads of the Oregon Trail and the routes fo the Boise Basin and Owyhee mines,” Boise’s population grew early and it eventually became the state capital in 1864.[^6]

### Brief history of Burke, Idaho

- Burke was settled by non-indigenous settlers in 1884 after mining for lead and silver brought a railroad in 1887.[^7] Burke is well-known as an extremely narrow valley, only 300 feet wide, uncommon for a town.[^7] A second railroad was built in 1890 and “its tracks had to be laid in Burke’s only street.”[^7] “It is said that many of the businesses had to roll in their awnings before the train passed.”[^7]
- As a mining site, it became part of the Coeur d’Alene [mining] District.[^7] Burke has an interesting history of mining labor strikes and unrest.[^7]
- The town saw many natural disasters – avalanches, floods – but the most notable is the large fire of 1923 that destroyed much of the town.[^7]
- In 1991, the last remaining mine closed down.[^7]
- As of 2020, Burke is an abandoned ghost town.[^7]

### Brief history of Moscow, Idaho

- Some sources suggest that the site was initially called “Hog Heaven” but later changed to “Palouse Valley” before becoming “Moscow.”[^Moscow]
- Moscow was “incorporated in 1887 and was chosen as the site for a land-grant institution, the University of Idaho, in 1889.”[^Moscow]

### Brief history of Lewiston

- Lewiston was “established as a gold-mining town on a site where the explorers Meriwether Lewis (for whom it was named) and William Clark camped (1805, 1806)” and it stands as “Idaho’s oldest incorporated community and was the first territorial capital” from 1863-1864 before the capital was moved to Boise, Idaho in 1865.[^Lewiston1]
- Lewiston, Idaho has been closely tied to Clarkston, Washington because “the only thing separating [the two] is a river with a state line running through it.”[^Lewiston2] Clarkston was also named after William Clark.[^Lewiston2]Together, they compose the “gateway to Hell’s Canyon National Recreation Area, home of North America’s deepest gorge.”[^Lewiston2]
