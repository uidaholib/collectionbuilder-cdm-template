## About the Collection

The University of Idaho Rangeland Center is made up of faculty, Extension research specialists, and Extension educators all across the state of Idaho, all dedicated to addressing the complex issues of rangeland ecology and management. The Rangeland Center Collection is a repository of information created by members of the collective that covers topics including grazing management, rural sociology, invasive plants, fire ecology, and more.  

*From the [UI Rangeland Center](https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/cnr/research/rangeland/about/RCwhyHandoutREV.pdf):*

The Rangeland Center is not a place or a building. Rather, this is an innovative unit that promotes collaboration among researchers, educators, students and land managers to address complex rangeland challenges â€” now and into the future. We promote interaction among scientists, land managers, tribal agencies, conservationists and ranchers and their respective associations, to create knowledge and foster stewardship of rangelands in Idaho and the West.

Effectively addressing rangeland conservation requires blending knowledge from many disciplines. Rangeland Center members are academic professionals with expertise uniquely aligned to grazing, rangeland ecology, entomology, soil science, economics, rural sociology, fish and wildlife management, invasive plant management, forage production, animal science, restoration and the use of spatial technologies to understand rangelands.
