## About John B. Miller

John B. Miller was born on a homestead in Bovill, Idaho during the summer of 1912. He grew up in Bovill, where pioneer life influenced the memories and events he would later describe in his book. After graduating from the University of Idaho with a degree in geology, he began work in foreign exploration for Standard Oil of California and moved to Belmont, Californa with his wife, Pastora, whom he met in Colombia during his travels. He returned often to his beloved hometown, usually for Bovill Days, and was an active member of the Latah County Historical Society. His love for the regionâ€™s history as well as a passion for communicating history through first-hand experiences led him to write and publish *The Trees Grew Tall* in 1972.
