## About the Collection

The Latah County Common Heritage Collection was driven by funding from a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) [Common Heritage Grant](https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2015-04-20#:~:text=The%20National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Humanities%20(NEH)%20today%20announced%20a,wider%20public%20and%20for%20posterity.) awarded to the University of Idaho Library in 2016. 
The materials in this collection were collected via community digitization days held in Moscow and Potlatch in 2016 and 2017.

The project was a collaboration between the University of Idaho Library and the [Latah County Historical Society](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/); it was directed by Devin Becker, Dulce Kersting, and Erin Stoddart.
If you have any questions about the collection or are interested in donating materials, please email us at [libspec@uidaho.edu](mailto:libspec@uidaho.edu).

The collection would not be possible without generous donations of time and materials from a variety of individual donors and staff. 
The directors would like to thank our donors:
