## About the Women's Center

{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="womenscenter124" width="50" %}

The [Women's Center](https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/edu/womens-center) on the University of Idaho's campus serves to promote gender equity in the community as well as provide opportunities to support, educate, and support individuals. In 1972, University President Ernest Hartung appointed a small committee to address the high female student drop-out rate which led to the creation of the Women's Center. The committee soon expanded their focus to address other campus issues involving faculty and staff. After formal complaints were filed against the University and the following conciliatory agreement, the committee brought much-needed change to the University including an Affirmative Action plan, equal starting salaries, recruitment programs for female students, and more. 

Initially started as a volunteer organization, the Women's Center has transformed into a fully staffed entity on campus that continues to promote and advocate for gender equality for the U of I community.
