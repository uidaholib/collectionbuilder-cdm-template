## An Inauspicious Beginning

The University of Idaho held it's first jazz festival in 1967 under the direction of Bruce Bray a faculty member in the School of Music. The following year, the festival was taken over by David Seiler and Robert Spevacek who ensured the focus of the festival was on music and jazz education for students. In the early years of the festival, the concerts showcased the University of Idaho's jazz bands and the top performing high school jazz bands selected during the day's competition. 

By the mid-1970's, the festival had grown from a single day of competitions culminating with a concert into a two day event. It was around this time that the festival, under the direction of Rich Werner and Denny Gold, began bringing nationally recognized jazz artists to hold clinics and perform at their evening concerts. Some early guest performers include: Roy Burns, Bill Tole, Gary Burton, and Lew Tabackin. 

In 1978, Lynn "Doc" Skinner took over as director of the festival. As director, Skinner wanted to further expand the educational aspect of the festival. He wanted students to ensure students were able to learn from the jazz festival. By 1980, the festival had grown to include three days of activities, hosting close to 1000 students. Under Skinner's direction the festival continued to grow. In 1982, he was able to secure one of the world's most notable jazz vocalists to perform, Ella Fitzgerald. Performing in Memorial Gym, Fitzgerald's performance began bringing some attention to the festival.

## The Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival

Lionel Hampton first performed at the University of Idaho Jazz Festival in 1984. After seeing the festivalâ€™s dedication to educating students, Hampton and the University began an 18 year relationship. This relationship saw the jazz festival and School of Music named after him. Hampton would also go on to receive an honorary degree from the university in 1988. With the influence of Hampton behind it, the festival continued to grow and feature world class jazz musicians. 

Attending the festival every year until his death in 2002, Hampton helped to grow the festival into a four day event. Festivals 

Due to the relationship developed between Hampton and the university the festival grew from a one day festival to a four day festival at it's peak, featuring world class jazz musicians and clinics not only in jazz music, but dance and history. 



Starting in 1995, Hampton and the University of Idaho began the Jazz in the Schools program. This program brought the world class jazz musicians coming to the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival into the K-12 class room. The musicians would come and visit schools in the area to talk about music and jazz. Every year during the festival, Hampton would travel to Lapwai, Idaho for the Jazz in Schools program.
