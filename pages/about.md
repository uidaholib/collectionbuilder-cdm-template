### Idaho history

In 1863, the U.S. Congress created Idaho Territory which "sprawled across an area one-quarter larger than Texas."[^1] Idaho was admitted to the union as the 43rd state in 1890.[^2] The name "Idaho" is believed to have been "derived from a Shoshone phrase meaning 'gem of the mountains.'"[^2]

### Brief history of Moscow, Idaho

- The first non-indigenous settlers came to Moscow in 1871 and the site was officially given the name "Moscow" in 1877 when a man, Samuel Neff, "filed for a postal permit under the name of Moscow because the area reminded him of his hometown of Moscow, Pennsylvania."[^3]
- Some sources suggest that the town was initially called "Hog Heaven" and later "Palouse Valley" before becoming "Moscow."[^3]
- Moscow was "incorporated in 1887 and was chosen as the site for a land-grant institution, the University of Idaho, in 1889."[^3]

### Brief history of Bovill, Idaho

- According to the Moscow-Pullman Daily News in 2018, Bovill is "a town whose history exemplifies many of the elements that today we associate with the Wild West."[^4]
- The town's story begins with Francis Warren, who had a personal settlement on the site. An Englishman, Hugh Bovill, came in 1899 to buy Warren's site "and build a hotel that could accommodate fellow hunters and anglers with an appetite for adventure" because he had been "drawn to the American frontier by tales of ample big game."[^4]
- The town initially grew because the timber industry was growing and drawing "homesteaders to northeast Latah County, so Bovill opened a store to supply their needs."[^4]
- To learn more about the early history of Bovill, the Latah County Historical Society recorded many oral histories in the 1970s.[^4]

### Brief history of Lewiston, Idaho

- Lewiston was "established as a gold-mining town on a site where the explorers Meriwether Lewis (for whom it was named) and William Clark camped (1805, 1806)" and it stands as "Idaho's oldest incorporated community and was the first territorial capital" from 1863-1864 before the capital was moved to Boise, Idaho in 1865.[]
