## About the Collection

The *Transitions* papers were donated to the [University of Idaho Library Special Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) as part of the John and Rachael Osborn Collection. The collection consists of approximately 300 cubic feet of materials that document pivotal struggles in the region’s environmental history, from forest conservation in Eastern Washington, North Idaho, and Western Montana to water conservation from the late 1900s to the present. 

The Osborns donated the materials from their prolific environmental conservation careers ahead of their semiretirement in 2017. The extensive collection is not fully available to researchers yet, but general questions about its contents can be directed to Special Collections [staff]( https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/about.html). Related materials found in the previously donated [John Osborn Papers, 1979-1997]( https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv48843/) collection can be viewed in the Special Collections [Reading Room]( https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/plan.html).

## About the Journal

*Transitions* is a quarterly journal from [The Land Council](https://landscouncil.org/) that highlights the historic transition from resource extraction to long-term community and biological sustainability in the Pacific and Inland Northwest region during the years 1988 to 2000. Issues of the journal cover a wide range of environmental and conservation topics ranging from forestry management, the logging industry, and railroad land grants to wilderness protection. 

Journal content includes newspaper stories (some from microfilm scans), photographs, original writing, and political cartoons. Each issue was hand-compiled by editor and publisher John Osborn which, up until about 1994, involved using scalpels, glue sticks, a light table, and a photocopier at Kinko’s. All together, the journal contains roughly 4,000 pages.

  <h3>“<i>Transitions</i> includes the best of my material on wilderness, forest planning, Coeur d’Alene Basin mining and smelting wastes, and the Northern Pacific railroad land grant. [It] focuses on the closing of frontiers—mining and timber. I lived part of this history as a public interest advocate, informing how the story is told.” </h3>

This collection marks the first time all issues of *Transitions* have been available in digital format. It is John and Rachael Osborn’s hope that expanded access to the journal will help publicly document the environmental history of the region during a critical time while also providing lessons that can be applied to ongoing environmental conflicts.
