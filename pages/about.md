### Brief history of Bovill, Idaho

- According to the Moscow-Pullman Daily News in 2018, Bovill is “a town whose history exemplifies many of the elements that today we associate with the Wild West.”[^5]
- The town’s story begins with Francis Warren who had a personal settlement on the site. An Englishman, Hugh Bovill, came in 1899 to buy Warren’s site “and build a hotel that could accommodate fellow hunters and anglers with an appetite for adventure” because he had been “drawn to the American frontier by tales of ample big game."[^5]
- The town initially grew because the timber industry was growing and drawing “homesteaders to northeast Latah County, so Bovill opened a store to supply their needs.”[^5]
- To learn more about Bovill's early days, Latah County Historical Society recorded oral histories in the 1970s that "reveal the hardships that folks endured, the kindness of strangers and the fire that destroyed much of the town."[^5]

### Brief history of Boise, Idaho

- The Boise Basin area saw its first non-indigenous settlers around the 1860s as people rushed to the area during the 1862 gold rush and established Fort Basie in 1863 (“the rise of mining interests and the resulting population surge prompted the U.S. military to establish Fort Basie”).  With an advantageous location “at the crossroads of the Oregon Trail and the routes fo the Boise Basin and Owyhee mines,” Boise’s population grew early and it eventually became the state capital in 1864.[^6]

### Brief history of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho

- Coeur d'Alene's earliest settlement days by non-indigenous people date back to the early 1800s when "the Northwest Fur Trading Company...began to establish fur trading posts in the Inland Northwest."[^CDA1] One of the trading posts was located on Lake Pend O'Reille. French fur traders in this area "began to use the French words 'Coeur d'Alene' as a nick name for the Schitsu’umsh people" who traded at the Lake Pend O'Reille post.[^CDA1] "In French 'Coeur' means heart and 'Alene" means awl, a sharp pointed tool used to pierce leather. In other words, they were known as sharp traders with hearts like the point of an awl. Within a few years the Schetsu’umsh people became known as the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and the large lake which was the center of their homeland became Lake Coeur d'Alene."[^CDA1]
- By 1878, a military fort was built on the lake and the population grew around it. Today, North Idaho College is on the location of that military fort, although "three of the original fort buildings are still in use: the chapel, powder magazine and one of the officer's quarters."[^CDA1]
- The city incorp[orated in 1887 and continued to grow in population as "railroads and steamboats provided transportation points between the Coeur d'Alene Lake, the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene Rivers," meaning the lake "soon became a destination for thousands of tourists."[^CDA1]
