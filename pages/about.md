## About the Collection

*ArborNotes* is a newsletter published by the Arboretum Associates, a volunteer fundraising group supporting the University of Idaho Arboretum. Members of Arboretum Associates automatically receive the *ArborNotes* newsletter. Still published today, *ArborNotes* gives readers reports and articles on the current status of the plants, wildlife, and conditions of the Arboretum, as well as updates on student projects and research happening on the site. The newsletter also includes notices of all events that occur in the Arboretum, including those held by the Arboretum Associates.

Print copies of the newsletters are also held in [Special Collections & Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) at the University of Idaho Library.

## About the Arboretum

One of two arboreta on the University of Idaho campus, the Arboretum was initiated in the 1970s as an extension of the University's [Shattuck Arboretum](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/shattuck/about.html) by a group of professors who were concerned that there was not enough plant diversity in the campus landscape. They dreamed of walking paths and a conservatory in which people could meander and enjoy a lush botanical garden full of plantings common to Asia, Europe, and North America.  

A tree-less plot of farmland adjacent to the U of I Golf Course and across the street from the U of I Executive Residence was chosen. Funds raised through an initial Comprehensive Education Training Act grant helped to establish the site, and donations and membership dues for the Arboretum Associates have covered all plantings since. The Arboretum continues to serve as a point of interest and study for the general public as well as a research and teaching site for classes and faculty in plant and soil sciences, landscape architecture, forestry, and biological sciences.
