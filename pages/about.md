## About the Collection

*From [University of Idaho Library Special Collections Bunker Hill Labor History Collection documentation](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/Manuscripts/mg367.htm):* 

The Bunker Hill Labor History Collection is 463 letters of correspondence between the managers and owners of the Bunker Hill Mine & Sullivan M. & C. Co. The correspondence files consist of incoming and outgoing letters, some arranged chronologically, others by subject.

The manager’s letters are letters from the manager of the mine in Kellogg to the president of the company in San Francisco, detailing the operations of the mine, union activities, and related information. In 1892 the letters were from V.M. Clement to John Hayes Hammond; letters for 1893 are lacking; 1894- 1896 are from F.W. Bradley to N.H. Harris; 1897-1898, Frederick Burbidge to Bradley, also Bradley and Burbidge to Alex Granger; and 1899-1909 Burbidge to Bradley or Granger.

Then comes a general correspondence file, 1894-1900 which is an alphabetically arranged group (M-Z, 1898-1900, is lacking). The majority of these letters are inter-company correspondence between the Kellogg and San Francisco offices, although there are a few letters from suppliers.

Correspondence from stockholders contains both incoming and outgoing letters and is arranged alphabetically by the stockholder’s last name. Most letters concern dividend payments, proxies, and stock purchases.

The F.W. Bradley correspondence files are arranged alphabetically by what appears to be the subject of the letter, although in some cases it is hard to tell. Letters were left in their original order. Most letters are from Bradley, as President as the company, to A. Burch and Frederick Burbidge and deal with routine company business.

The manager’s letters of Stanly A. Easton, 1904-1926 (lacking May-December 1911 and January-March 1919) contain originals of Easton’s letters to Bradley, carbon copies of letters from Easton to others which were enclosed in his letters, and copies of Bradley’s replies. One file in this group concerns concentration and slips of paper in the main file refer to this concentration file, while slips in the concentration file refer to letters in the main group. For the years 1921 to May 1926 there is a separate file of carbon letters from Bradley to Easton. The letters from Easton to Jules Labarthe in San Francisco are original letters from Easton and carbons of Labarthe’s replies. Most of these letters concern the cost of smelting.
