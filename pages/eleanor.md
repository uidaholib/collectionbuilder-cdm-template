## Eleanor Roosevelt Speaks on 'Peace' at the University of Idaho

First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt traveled to the University of Idaho campus in 1938 at the invitation of UI’s [William E. Borah Foundation](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah/about) to speak on the subject of peace. Roosevelt’s history as an advocate for peace and human rights made her a fitting speaker for what would be the first ever [Borah Symposium](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah/archives), a program that continues to this day. A March 29th, 1938 [Argonaut article](https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/collection/argonaut/id/1788?_ga=2.101361409.1641847730.1622750906-1003406525.1589573720) describes her speech and other details of her visit to Moscow and the University of Idaho campus.

Like her uncle, former president Theodore Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt planted a [commemorative Douglas Fir tree](https://uofihistory.wordpress.com/visit-to-uofi/) in the lawn in front of the University of Idaho Administration Building during her visit. The tree can be seen today across from the main entrance to the building.

Roosevelt wrote a national syndicated newspaper column called “[My Day](https://erpapers.columbian.gwu.edu/my-day)” from 1935 to 1962. The collection is held and made available by the [Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project](https://erpapers.columbian.gwu.edu/) at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. In her column, Roosevelt described aspects of her daily life, from the books she read to her public appearances. In the [March 29, 1938 entry](https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/myday/displaydoc.cfm?_y=1938&_f=md054913), she briefly describes her visit to the Palouse as a "revelation".
