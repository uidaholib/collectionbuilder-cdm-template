## Moscow Food Co-op History

The Moscow Food Co-op was established in 1973 by friends Rod Davis, Jim Eagan, and Dave and Katie Mosel. For more than 45 years, the co-op has promoted their cooperative identity by being good stewards of the earth and each other. 

In the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.
