# Exploring the History of Jazz at the University of Idaho

Spencer Manning, a University of Idaho student pursuing an M.A. in Trumpet Performance, was the recipient of the 2020 Berry International Jazz Fellowship.
Over the course of this fellowship, Manning investigated the contents of the [Lionel Hampton Papers](http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv46578){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the [Lionel Hampton Digital Collection](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/hampton_collection/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and the University of Idaho International Jazz Festival Collection, with the hope of learning more about the history of UI's jazz festival and Lionel Hampton's role in that history.
His research led him to one of the most important figures of UI's jazz festival, Lynn "Doc" Skinner.

Skinner agreed to participate in a series of two virtual interviews with Manning in December 2020, during which the two discussed the history of the festival, the naming of the Lionel Hampton School of Music, Lionel Hampton himself, performances by jazz greats such as Dizzy Gillespie and Ella Fitzgerald, and much more.
The interviews can be viewed in full [in this collection](/digital/jazzfest/browse.html#video), and interview highlights are provided below, accompanied by Manning's commentary.

We sincerely hope that you enjoy learning more about this storied festival through these interviews.
