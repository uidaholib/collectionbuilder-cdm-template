        <h2>The Letters of Carleton Watkins</h2>

        <p>At the age of fifty, Carleton Watkins married 22-year-old Frances ('Frankie') Henrietta Sneed in 1879 and proceeded to have two children, Collis Potter and Julia Caroline. Watkins wrote to his new wife consistently during his travels, and some of his letters to her have survived, being deposited at <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/">The Bancroft Library</a>, University of California, Berkeley, in 1967. These were then converted into a gift in 1978 by Professor Joe Johnson &#8212; <a href="http://oac.cdlib.org/search?style=oac4;Institution=UC%20Berkeley::Bancroft%20Library;titlesAZ=C;idT=UCb110037807"> Carleton E.

        <p class="letter" name="l1">Anaconda, Saturday, 5 July [1890] <br /><br />
            Dear Frank,<br /><br />
            Yesterday, the "glorious fourth", I started in to do some work
            and did do some although the day was not satisfactory and today
            it is cloudy and raining. You can imagine in what humor I am in.
            Nearly a month gone and nothing done. The oldest inhabitant
            here never saw anything like it but those that are not so old say
            the rainy season generally lasts until the 4th of July. This year is
            certainly no exception. If it was good weather, I should have a
            tough job ahead of me and as it is it makes me pretty nearly sick
            and there is provocation enough without the weather.
            I am in constant pain with my hip and have to limp in walking.
            Sometimes it seems as if I could not stand it, but I have to.
            Went up to Butte last week and tried making views in the mine
            with a combination of electric and flash light and it didn't work
            worth a damn, but it <em>got it</em> "all the same." Telegraphed to New
            York for three more lights. When they come <em>that</em> part of the
            work won't be much of a picnic.<br /><br />
            I am getting thin and no wonder. Of all the places I ever
            struck to get anything good to eat this is the worst. If you ever
            see me again you may expect to behold a <em>skelating</em> [sic].
            Yesterday I had a nice lunch at Mrs. Tunny's. Besides getting a
            nice lunch I got the Fitz for not coming <em>oftener</em>. Only been once
            before. She says, oh! if you had only come along what a splen
            did time you and she would have had. They seem to be nicely
            fixed and <em>will</em> as usual have some good <em>prospects</em>. She wishes to
            be remembered and says she is going to write. People always are.
            Letters don't come very thick from Home when you consider
            there are three to write them. I don't think any of the three need
            stand on ceremony about getting answers. Should like to know
            how things are getting on. Sent a dispatch to San Rafael a few
            days ago to have the man pay up. Did he do so? And if he <em>did</em>
            not, how do you stand off the wolf?<br /><br />
            Tell Juju Papa was very much pleased with her letter and
            would like some more. Helena all the same. And when I am not
            so D----- blue, will answer them.<br /><br />
            Am going across the creek to <em>rustle</em> for grub and my stomach
            kicks before [illegible]. Hope I shall have some more pleasant
            news to write soon.<br /><br />
            The wind howls so I will stop. One is enough at a time. Hope
            Collis is a good boy and don't <em>wheeze</em>. Kiss them all and keep
            lots for yourself.<br /><br />
            Papa
            <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <p class="letter" name="l2">
            Butte, Montana, Tuesday, 22 July [1890]<br /><br />
            Dear Frank,<br /><br />
            Your letters have come along at intervals and yesterday I
            received Juju's last. Please give her papa's love. Tell her she is a
            nice girl and to keep on in the same way. I expect to hear from
            Helena and the package of views today as also from yourself.<br /><br />

            I came up from Anaconda last week and here I have been sitting
            since trying to peer though the smoke which is thick enough to cut.
            There is no use to swear for I have xausted [sic] all of my vocabulary
            and that is a pretty good one as you know and it only makes
            more sulfur in this country where there is so much of it. It is hot and
            very little wind and I can do nothing but wait. Grin. And bear it.<br /><br />

            I sent yesterday the <em>document</em> to Uncle Andrew that makes
            Somebody else administrator to an Estate that is not worth anything,
            and that is off my mind. I see by Juju's letter that you
            have something to eat once more and I am only sorry that it will
            last so little while. Hope you will enjoy it while it does last.<br /><br />

            Tell Myra that yesterday I had two (2) "red headed snappers"
            and one I eat [sic]! and the other I don't seem to have any particular
            use for. And as she likes them she can have it if she wants it.
            Yesterday I went down to the city for my mail and my grub and on
            the bill of fare saw something that made me laugh. And I told the
            waiter that I would take some as my best girl said it was mighty
            good and he laughed. And it <em>was</em> good. Tell Myra I wish she could
            <em>have some</em> every day and I <em>know</em> you would like it. I hope she has
            gone to work and will make some trade and reduce the expenses.<br /><br />

            The largest mine here, the "Anaconda" which is just across
            the road from my car is the one that caught fire last year and
            was flooded with water to put out the fire. They have been
            pumping for a long time and just before I came to Anaconda
            they took out 3 of the 5 men that were killed in the mine. This
            morning they are preparing to take out the other two that were
            found last night. The mine is full of bad air and as it is the one
            they want the most work done in I shall have to put it off until
            the last. I started in when I came up to do mine work with the
            flash lamps and in making preparations got hot. Caught cold in
            a wet room, and yesterday I was so "Bunged up" that I could
            scarcely move. Stiff today (not the vel-hand [sic]) but better.
            The job is going to be interminably long, but I must wait and do
            good work. I don't know when you will see me but it will surely be sometime.
            I hope the San Rafael man has been in and paid
            his bill. I cannot imagine what is the matter. Keep writing and
            have Helena and Juju do the same. Give them all lots of hugs
            and kisses and in the absence of Myras <em>Fish</em> be satisfied with
            the same yourself.<br /><br />
            Papa

            Butte, Sunday, 27 [July 1890]<br /><br />
            Dear Frank,<br /><br />
            Read your letter of 22nd yesterday and if I wanted anything to
            make me cuss such a letter would be just the thing. <em>Why</em> don't
            you assert your independence enough to tell people to mind their
            own affairs and then mind yours.<br /><br />
            I don't see why you should have told <em>anybody</em> about your
            money business and having it. And I don't see why you should
            go barefoot. And Helena, the great big slat-sided galoot setting
            up a cry because some other galoot takes her to task about her
            money. Its her own, ain't it? And she can do what she wants
            with it. Why the H--- don't she tell them so. I am sure the
            amount is not [so] large that she is likely to buy a farm with it
            every month if she did go bare x-ed. The fact is I am ugly as sin
            and I think your officious friends would shut up if they had me
            to talk with for a little while.<br /><br />
            I have been up here more than a week and have worked two
            days in the mine. Nasty work, and I don't believe it will turn out
            worth a dam. Outside the climate is <em>simply</em> execrable. Hot, dusty,
            windy &#8211; a gale &#8211; and so smokey that from the Hill you can't see
            the town and from the town you can't see the Hill. It is very
            doubtful if I can do anything here to my satisfaction or anywhere near it.
            I am getting sick literally and figuratively.<br /><br />
            I am very sorry that your mother is unwell and I think that
            you should go and take care of her. Why can't you leave Helena
            in the place. She can make some arrangements about the night
            trouble with some of her friends. Take what money you have left
            and go. I will try and make out about the rent and I think you
            would all be better for it if Helena don't kick. I am in anything
            but a mood for writing today and I have to take this a long way
            to mail it if it goes tonight and among my other troubles are my
            feet which are in a bad way. That crooked toe is making it very
            unpleasant for me and to walk is pretty near torture.<br /><br />
            What is the matter of my Sweetheart and little girl and boy
            too that they can't write. I should like to hear from them all and
            often. The wind is howling. The dust is flying and it's Ott [sic].
            But I will do this up and take my shanks down the Hill and I
            hope that when it reaches you that all of you will all be in a better humor,
            and if you are not, just imagine that I am hugging and
            kissing you until you are happy. God bless you.<br /><br />
            Papa

            Anaconda, Friday, 5th [September 1890]<br /><br />
            Dear Wife and Babies and Sweet Heart,<br /><br />
            It rains blue blazes and the wind howls and it is as cold as
            Greenland or Montana and the day is generally "Dark and
            Dreary" but when one gets news even under such conditions
            from Wife and Babies and Sweetheart - <em>all in a heap!</em> he must
            be in a bad way indeed if his heart don't feel a little chirpy and
            his blood warm up if it is getting thin. I am glad that there is to
            be no more <em>growling</em>.<br /><br />
            Myra is no doubt very inconsiderate about the <em>money</em> but that
            she purposely treats you mean is I think very absurd. What possible motive can she
            have for doing anything of the kind and how
            abundant are the reasons for her <em>not</em> doing so. Myra has her ways
            as we all have and I remember you did not like them so well
            before I left home. I hope you will get along without having a
            rumpus and you need not worry about the amount of <em>saccharine
                matter</em> in any letters that I <em>may</em> write. No more growls from me.<br /><br />
            I was especially delighted with the letter from Collis and from
            Juju. I think "your boy" did splendidly for the first time and you
            tell him that I shall have to take him along in the car to write my
            letters for me. I hope he is well by this time and that he and Juju
            and all the cousins and uncles and aunts will have a good time
            during the <em>blowout</em> of the Native Sons and Daughters. I shall
            expect "My Boy" and girl to write me very often as their letters
            do their papa more good than Montana grub.<br /><br />
            Tell Sweetheart that these thin legs of mine will need a heap
            of magnetism if I ever get a chance again and I expect as fast as
            I get it somebody will be getting it away from me. The fact is
            that I am getting awful hungry for kisses and hugs and things.
            Not a blessed one of any of them have I had since I left San
            Francisco and I just want heaps of them.<br /><br />
            I have got along so far without <em>loosing my head</em> and am in
            hopes that I may get home again before it flies off entirely. I
            don't think there will be enough left of the Haggin money to buy
            beef to put me in condition again. He was here two days this
            week but I did not see him.<br /><br />
            I will write Sweetheart in a few days and I send her and the
            children lots of kisses and hugs and <em>you</em> lots of things.<br /><br />

            Anaconda, Sunday, 21 September [1890]<br /><br />
            Dear Sweetheart,<br /><br />
            Your letter came this morning and I was pleased to hear that
            you, as well as Juju, were much better. Frank's letter informed
            me that you had given way under the strain of continued dissipation
            and I hope now that the cause is removed, that you will settle down in the even tenor of your ways and that your
            "poor little belly" will get well and sound again. <br /><br />
            I hope you all had a nice time with the sons and daughters but
            I have no doubt you are glad it is all over. I know I should be. I
            am longing to get home but one thing and another puts me off
            and off and the devil knows when I shall turn either end of the
            old car toward the coast. When the day does come <em>nobody can</em>
            be more pleased than I shall. I have no love for the country and
            what is much more to the point, I have no love for anybody in it
            and I want to see my "gude wife" and "my bairns" and not last
            nor least my dear old sweetheart. Frank says she is going to be
            awful good when I get home and she is not going to kick any
            more, if you don't, so for Heaven sake try and be gentle and
            don't get over the traces for my sake.<br /><br />
            You say it looks like rain. Here there has been lots of it and
            snow also and cold with all but just now it is Indian Summer and
            the days are very nice <em>if</em> you did not want to make Photos, but
            the air is full of haze when it is not so smokey that you can see
            nothing. I hope it won't last <em>but it might</em> for two months. So
            everybody says. If it does, heaven save us and send us a cook.<br /><br />
            Tell Collis that Papa is proud to think that somebody is in the
            house that can stand the racket and that is able to take care of the
            rest of the folks when they get sick. Tell him to keep his eye
            open and look out for the sick people and when I get home
            maybe I will give him a job. Tell Frank I am glad to hear that her
            health is spel-en-ded. I suppose she means by that that the <em>bad
                spells</em> are all over with. I am glad to hear she is not falling away,
            altho you seem to think so, and I shall make no objection to
            putting some of it <em>on my bones</em> if she does not try to <em>get on too
                much</em>. Kiss and hug them all around for me. Tell Juju that Papa
            will try and write her next time and hopes this letter will find
            you all well and happy. God bless you all.<br /><br />
            Papa

            Anaconda [Montana], Wednesday, 27th [September 1890]<br /><br />
            Dear Frank,<br /><br />
            I am in no mood for writing but I have put it off so long that I
            feel I must write a few lines. Yesterday I was taken with one of
            my vertigo fits and while I manage to get about it has <em>upset</em> me
            completely. I was in hopes to get through with the infernal job
            before it got after me but it was not to be. I hope it will not be a
            bad attack. If it should, the Lord save us. The work goes awful
            slow and you may not expect to see me until the eleventh of
            October and perhaps not then. I am going to try and do the best I
            can. I <em>wish</em> you would do the same and try to get along without so
            much growling. I don't think it makes either one of us any happier
            and I am sure it don't me. I am getting very tired of Montana and I
            want to see you all, Wife and Babies and Sweet Heart but I have
            got to fight it out and I was not in very good fighting trim before
            this last trouble. Don't worry yourself or me about bills or money.
            People can't get it until I do or until I get home. With your letter
            came one from Myra. No news except about a rat. Am ashamed to
            say I have not written her yet. Tell Sweet Heart that when I get
            full of saccharine matter I will answer her letters and in the mean
            time she can keep on doing well. Is Julia so busy learning that she
            can t write? And Collis too. What is the matter with him? I would
            like to hear once in awhile that I have got some <em>childrens</em>.<br /><br />
            I will try and write in a day or two and let you know how I get
            along. I hope the fit will wear off. Kiss the children, Sweetheart
            and yourself and lots of hugs all round.<br /><br />
            Papa

            Anaconda, Thursday pm, 2 October [1890]<br /><br />
            Dear Frank,<br /><br />
            Your letter of Sunday and Monday came today and finds me
            boxed up in the car and a Snow Storm raging outside and it is cold
            as it ought to be in a snowstorm. If you don't think <em>I wish</em> I was
            home, you are mistaken. It is bad enough when the elements are
            gracious but when they are not, "Good Gracious," it's Horrible<br /><br />
            I hope to leave Anaconda in a few days for Butte and let us '
            hope that I will not drag along then as I have here. When I last
            wrote my digestive apparatus was not on a very firm basis but
            was much better than<em>previously</em> and I still have my <em>backsliding</em>
            days but Iam not as worried as I was about myself, but I am worried about Helena. Try and keep her at home and stuff her with the
            best things you can get money to buy. Tell her I am awful sorry
            but I have no fat to give her but when I get home she shall have
            everything I have got, fat and lean. I send you what I can very
            poorly spare and for Heaven Sake <em>don't</em> spend it for <em>anything</em> but
            grub and eat and be merry and grow fat but <em>don't</em> tell us of the
            good things you have and make our mouth water and then have to
            eat such Stuff as one gets here if he don't cook his own potatoes. <br /><br />
            If this letter goes tonight it must close up. Kiss the children big
            and little and give them fat hugs as you are the only one in the
            family that deals in that healthy commodity. The wind is howling outside and it just goes through my rickety old bones.
            But never mind we'll get fat again I hope. All of us. God bless you.<br /><br />
            Papa

            Anaconda, Monday, 15th [October 1890]<br /><br />
            Dear Sweetheart,<br /><br />
            I must write you a few lines however little I feel like it. You
            see I am still at this horrible hole. Froze up or so nearly so.
            There is no fun in it. There has been continual snow and wind
            and hail and sleet and every other detestable element of weather
            that the clerk can give us for nearly ten days. And with all my
            other troubles my hands are <em>awful</em> and the German salve is all
            used up. I bought some Russian salve a couple days ago and
            used it one night and it kept me awake nearly all night with the
            heat and inflammation.<br /><br />
            I am anxious to hear from you and suppose my letters are going
            to Butte. I received one from Frank that was remailed to this place.
            I hope you have broken up the fever and are getting along nicely. It
            is bad enough to be poor and not have anything to eat without
            being sick in the bargain. I am hungry for home. I want to see you
            all and hug you all and if you have nothing else, eat you all up.<br /><br />
            I hope to get out of this place in four days and have been hoping so for a month. Some day I will make a start.<br /><br />
            You must forgive me for not writing a longer letter. There is
            nothing to say and I have got the Dumps. Kiss and hug them all
            around for me and keep lots for yourself.<br /><br />
            Papa

            <br /><br /><br /><br />
